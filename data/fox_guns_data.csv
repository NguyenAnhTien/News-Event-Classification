Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2014/10/18/airbag-equipped-motorcycle-vest-could-be-life-saver/, Inflatable life vests arent just for airline passengers anymore The Spidi Neck DPS is a safety vest for motorcycle riders equipped with a builtin airbag system designed to protect against serious spinal injuries     Two airbags are installed into the collar of the vest and are attached to a small CO2 canister similar to those used by air guns A tether connects the trigger for the canister to the motorcycle and if a rider falls off it inflates the airbags within 2 seconds The bags fill the space between the riders shoulders and helmet to help hold their head in place they slide or roll along the ground and stay inflated for several minutes Spidi says this can dramatically reduce the types of spinal damage caused by a head snapping around wildly that can lead to serious injury including paralysis or death The technology was originally developed for motorcycle racing suits but was adapted to the vest which can be adjusted to fit over almost any type of clothing and includes crotch straps to help keep it in place Unlike a car airbag as long as its not damaged in a crash after a deployment it can be repacked by its owner loaded with a new CO2 charge and used again The Neck DPS is now available in the US for 599 and is being demonstrated at the AIMExpo in Orlando this weekend,2014-10-18T15:32-04:00,guns

known as Ayn Arab and its surrounding areas has been under assault by extremists of the Islamic State group since midSeptember and is being defended by Kurdish fighters AP PhotoVadim GhirdaThe Associated Press SURUC Turkey  A group of Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga troops arrived in Turkey early Wednesday on their way to Syria to help their Syrian Kurdish brethren fight Islamic State extremists in the embattled border town of Kobani The unprecedented mission by the 150 fighters came after Ankara agreed to allow the peshmerga troops to cross into Syria via Turkey   although the Turkish prime minister reiterated that his country would not be sending any ground forces of its own to Kobani along the SyrianTurkish border     After a rousing sendoff from thousands of cheering flagwaving supporters in the Iraqi Kurdish capital of Irbil the peshmerga forces landed early Wednesday at the Sanliurfa airport in southeastern Turkey They left the airport in buses escorted by Turkish security forces and were expected to travel to Kobani through the Mursitpinar border crossing with Syria Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told the BBC that sending the peshmerga was the only way to help Kobani since other countries dont want to use ground troops The Islamic State group launched its offensive on Kobani and nearby Syrian villages in midSeptember killing more than 800 people according to activists The Sunni extremists captured dozens of Kurdish villages around Kobani and control parts of the town More than 200000 people have fled across the border into Turkey The US is leading a coalition that has carried out dozens of airstrikes targeting the militants in and around Kobani The deployment of the 150 peshmerga fighters who were authorized by the Iraqi Kurdish government to go to Kobani underscores the sensitive political tensions in the region Turkeys government views the Syrian Kurds defending Kobani as loyal to what Ankara regards as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK That group has waged a 30year insurgency in Turkey and is designated a terrorist group by the US and NATO Under pressure to take greater action against the IS militants    from the West as well as from Kurds inside Turkey and Syria    the Turkish government agreed to let the fighters cross through its territory But it only is allowing the peshmerga forces from Iraq with whom it has a good relationship and not those from the PKK A separate Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga convoy of Toyota Land Cruisers and trucks carrying cannons and machine guns crossed into Turkey early Wednesday at the Ibrahim Khalil border crossing at Zakho in northern Iraq The land convoy and the 150 fighters were expected to join up and cross jointly into Syria Peshmerga soldiers carrying Kurdish flags were atop some of the vehicles as they headed from Irbil to the IraqiTurkish border crossing The troops made the victory sign for the cameras An ambulance and government vehicles blaring their sirens accompanied the convoy Scores of people waited by the side of the road in villages for the troops to pass Thousands of people awaited them at the border The crowd sang and chanted traditional peshmerga songs and had to be pushed back by every vehicle that tried to make its way through the masses Many people carried colorful Kurdish flags and portraits of the Iraqi Kurdish regional President Massoud Barzani The Kurds of Syria and Iraq have become a major focus in the war against the Islamic State group with Kurdish populations in both countries under significant threat by the militant groups lightning advance as it seeks to establish an Islamic caliphate in the region The Iraqi Kurdish parliament voted overwhelmingly to send fighters to Kobani underscoring the growing cooperation among the Kurds in Iraq and Syria The action marked the first mission for the peshmerga outside Iraq US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said US officials certainly encourage the deployment of Iraqi peshmerga forces to Kobani It will provide muchneeded support for the Syrian Kurds although it is not clear whether Turkey will allow the peshmerga fighters to carry enough weaponry to make an impact On Tuesday the US Central Command said US military forces carried out four airstrikes near Kobani in the past 24 hours destroying four IS fighting positions and a small IS unit In Berlin on Tuesday Syrias neighbors urged European countries at a conference of foreign ministers and representatives from 40 nations to open their doors to more refugees and for immediate financial and technological help as their infrastructures buckle under the massive influx of civilians fleeing the conflict Turkey has agreed to train and equip moderate Syrian rebel forces that have for more than three years sought to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad More than 3 million people have fled Syria because of the conflict mostly to neighboring countries Another 6 million are displaced within Syria The conflict began with largely peaceful protests in March 2011 calling for reform It eventually spiraled into a civil war as people took up arms following a brutal military crackdown on the protest movement Islamic extremists including foreign fighters have joined the war playing an increasingly prominent role in the conflict Thousands have died in battles between opposing rebel groups since the beginning of the year,2014-10-29T02:58-04:00,guns

Marine Expeditionary Brigade  Afghanistan load onto a KC130 aircraft on the Camp Bastion Afghanistan flightline Monday Oct 27 2014 The handover of the US Marines main base to Afghan control in the hardscrabble Helmand province is more than a signal that Americas longest war is ending It is a reminder of the enormous loss and sacrifice by Marines who swept in as part of President Barack Obamas surge of forces against a resurgent Taliban in 2009  AP PhotoStaff Sgt John Jackson Defense Department US MarinesThe Associated Press WASHINGTON  The Marines handover of Camp Leatherneck to the Afghans is more than a signal that Americas longest war is ending It is a reminder that the Marines battlefield gains were tempered by losses 378 killed nearly 5000 wounded Camp Leatherneck is the sprawling base in Afghanistans Helmand province from which the Marines surged against the Taliban in 2009     The keys to Leatherneck were turned over to Afghan authorities Sunday in a ceremony that also marked the handover of Camp Bastion an adjacent Britishrun airfield Helmand province was the epicenter of President Barack Obamas surge against the Taliban The Marines focused on it so completely that some dubbed the patch of desert Marineistan It was the fight the Marines itched for after they switched their attention from Iraqs Anbar province which by 2008 had grown so quiet that Marines complained of boredom There arent a whole heck of a lot of bad guys there left to fight the Marine Corps commandant at the time Gen James T Conway said in August 2008 with an eye on getting a piece of the Afghan action After the Marines had turned the tide in Helmand the man who succeeded Conway Gen James Amos said in 2011 that it was time to begin handing over control to the Afghans whose ability to handle the Taliban and unify their fractured country would ultimately decide the outcome of the US chapter of this war We cant stay in Afghanistan forever Amos said While there the Marines took on the Taliban mentored Afghan soldiers and executed a protectthepopulation counterinsurgency strategy They also suffered at the hands of Afghan allies who periodically turned their weapons on them in greenonblue killings that peaked in 2012 but have since subsided The Marines point with pride to their successes in Helmand where Afghan security forces now are in charge But some question whether those gains will be sustained after the Marines are gone and the Taliban seek another comeback Just two years ago at the Britishrun Camp Bastion adjacent to Leatherneck the Taliban pulled off arguably their most stunning attack on a NATO base of the entire war Fifteen insurgents breached the camps security perimeter and using grenades machine guns and other light weapons killed two Marines and destroyed or heavily damaged nine aircraft In all about 76000 Marines served in Afghanistan since 2001 mostly in Helmand according to Marine Corps records The Marines are now departing as the US prepares to complete its combat mission in December and transition to a NATOorganized followon mission called Resolute Support to train and advise Afghan forces There are still a little over 21000 American troops in Afghanistan down from a 20102011 peak of 100000 The saga of Marines in southwestern Afghanistan began with the controversial decision to make Helmand the main focus of Obamas initial surge of American troops in early 2009 Some believed it should instead by the neighboring province of Kandahar whose far bigger population seemed to make it of greater strategic importance In his book Little America The War Within the War for Afghanistan author Rajiv Chandrasekaran wrote that the consequences were profound By devoting so many troops to Helmand instead of Kandahar the US military squandered more than a year of the war he wrote Had the initial contingent of Marines been sent to Kandahar it could have obviated the need for a full 30000troop surge later that year or it could have granted commanders the flexibility to combat insurgent havens in eastern Afghanistan much sooner allowing them to meet Obamas eventual withdrawal deadlines without objection When the Marines took on Helmand they did so with gusto The scene of some of the hardest fighting was Sangin a district along the Helmand River that for years was a Taliban stronghold Dozens of Marines were killed in battles in 2010 that eventually turned the tide against an adaptive insurgency In one fourday stretch in October 2010 nine members of 3rd Battalion 5th Marines out of Camp Pendleton California were killed The toll that autumn became so great that thenDefense Secretary Robert Gates recommended pulling the battalion out of Sangin temporarily though the Marines declined saying it could break the spirit of that battalion In March 2011 Gates visited the battalion at its base near Sangin and applauded the Marines for their strategic breakdthrough Before you arrived here the Taliban were dug in deep and as the British before you can attest this district was one of the most dangerous   not just in Afghanistan but maybe in the whole world Gates said Helmand was not the Marine Corps first plunge into Afghanistan In November 2001 Marine Brig Gen James Mattis led a contingent of Marines and soldiers dubbed Task Force 58 into southern Afghanistan in an air assault that established the first conventional US military presence in the country ___ Follow Robert Burns on Twitter at httpwwwtwittercomrobertburnsAP,2014-10-27T17:30-04:00,guns

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2014/10/01/2014-15-colorado-avalanche-preview/,"SportsNetworkcom  Patrick Roy earned plenty of hardware during his playing    days and it seems the Hall of Fame goaltender isnt done adding trophies to    his mantle Not much was expected of the Colorado Avalanche in 201314 but Roy managed to 
  raise the bar in Denver as a rookie NHL coach leading the Avs to a Central 
  Division title while picking up the Jack Adams Award for himself Of course Roy is hardly satisfied with merely making the playoffs He was a 
  big part of four Stanley Cup championship teams as a goalie lifting the Cup 
  twice with Montreal and two more times in Colorado Clearly anything short of 
  returning to the top of the NHL mountain as a coach would be considered 
  failure Colorado president Joe Sakic a teammate of Roys on two championship teams 
  and himself a Hockey Hall of Famer was criticized before the start of last 
  season for pairing a rookie coach with a young team However Roy made it easy 
  on his old friend by getting the Avs off to a ridiculously hot start winning 
  14 of his first 16 games behind the bench The critics kept waiting for the 
  Roys Avalanche to implode but that didnt happen until the first round of 
  the playoffs when Colorado fell in seven games to Minnesota Even after putting together a 52win season and taking first place in arguably 
  the toughest division in hockey Colorado still has plenty to prove in 
  201415 The Avs critics are not as vocal as they were a year ago but they havent 
  gone anywhere The only way to shut them up for good is by winning it all Roy 
  may not get Cup No 5 in 2015 but hes made it harder to bet against him FORWARDS  The Avalanche halted a threeyear playoff drought last spring and 
  it wasnt all due to Roys coaching ability Colorado was able to stockpile talent through the draft while making the 
  playoffs once in the five seasons prior to Roys arrival behind the bench and 
  last season was a good sign the youth movement is taking hold We knew about talented young forwards Matt Duchene Gabriel Landeskog and Ryan 
  OReilly prior to last season but 201314 saw Nathan MacKinnon join 
  Colorados list of offensive studs At 23 year of age Duchene and OReilly 
  are the elder statesmen of the group MacKinnon the first overall pick of the 2013 NHL draft posted 24 goals and 
  63 points in 82 games last season en route to winning the Calder Trophy as an 
  18yearold rookie He also produced at a dizzying pace during the playoffs 
  burning the Minnesota defense for 10 points 2 goals 8 assists in seven 
  games Considering Duchene MacKinnon and OReilly are all natural centermen it 
  makes sense Sakic allowed pivot Paul Stastny to walk via free agency Stastny 
  could come back to haunt the Avs as a member of the divisional rival St Louis 
  Blues but its hard to argue with Sakics decision to rely on his younger and 
  better options down the middle Even without Stastny Colorado has a logjam at the center position and it will 
  likely lead to OReilly being pushed to the wing as he was for much of last 
  season The versatile OReilly didnt seem too bothered by the switch as he 
  set personal bests in both goals 28 and points 64 Duchene also set a career best in points with 70 recording 23 goals and 47 
  assists over 71 games Not to be outdone the 21yearold Landeskog set high 
  marks in both goals 26 and assists 39 during his third season as an NHLer Colorados young guns are a big reason the club finished fourth in the NHL 
  with 299 goals per game last season but Roy does have veteran options to 
  utilize on the top two lines One of those players is incoming free agent 
  Jarome Iginla who turned 37 years old this summer but is coming off a 30goal 
  season with Boston Iginla notched 61 points 30G 31A in 78 games for the Bruins and reached the 
  30goal mark for the 12th time in his illustrious career Signing a player of 
  Iginlas age to a threeyear 16 million contract is a risky investment but 
  Colorado is betting the former longtime Calgary Flame has a few good years 
  left Sakic also acquired Daniel Briere from Montreal in an offseason trade which 
  sent PA Parenteau to the Canadiens Briere will turn 37 years old a few days 
  before the start of the season and is coming off a 12goal 25point showing 
  for the Habs in 201314 As always Briere managed to pick up the pace in the 
  playoffs with seven points in 16 games and his postseason prowess could come 
  in handy Briere could be pegged for the third line while Iginla and winger Alex 
  Tanguay could earn coveted spots on one of Colorados top lines Tanguay is 
  aiming to rebound after injuries caused him to miss all but 16 games during 
  the regular season and all of the playoffs The 34yearold does boast six 
  seasons of 20plus goals on his NHL resume including four such campaigns 
  while during his initial run with Colorado from 19992000 to 200506 With the top two lines expected to do the heavy lifting for the offense 
  Colorados bottom six can focus on playing a responsible twoway game Its a 
  job veterans like Jamie McGinn John Mitchell and Maxime Talbot are more than 
  capable of handling DEFENSE  While the Avs are loaded with talented young players up front the 
  defense is lagging far behind Colorado was near the bottom of the league rankings in terms of shots allowed 
  per game 327 and the blame falls mostly on the clubs less than impressive 
  group of defenseman Sakic added veteran Brad Stuart to the mix in an 
  offseason trade with San Jose but the problems on defense are still a going 
  concern Erik Johnson is the clear No 1 option for Roy as he led the Colorado blue

  Jan Hejda is Johnsons normal skating partner and is coming off a season in 
  which he recorded six goals and 11 assists over 78 games Stuart 34 is a stayathome type who could balance out the second pairing by 
  giving Tyson Barrie ample opportunities to push the puck up ice Barrie led 
  Colorados defense with 13 goals in 64 games last season and finished one 
  point behind Johnson Barrie also plays a key role as a pointman on the power play It was clear 
  Colorado missed him after the blueliner was knocked out of the playoffs by 
  Matt Cookes vicious kneetoknee hit in Game 3 Nick Holden added 10 goals from the back end during the regular season and 
  added three more tallies in the playoffs Even more impressive is that it was 
  the first full NHL campaign for the 27yearold undrafted defenseman Holden has earned his spot on the third pairing but his partner could change 
  with regularity as Colorado expects to carry eight defensemen Nate Guenin 
  Zach Redmond and Ryan Wilson all could fill the sixth Dman spot this season GOALTENDING  Its fun to talk about Roys amazing rookie season as a coach 
  and the emergence of Colorados young offense but the most essential 
  component of the teams thrilling 201314 campaign had to be goaltender 
  Semyon Varlamov Facing a ton of shots most nights the Russian netminder played Vezinacaliber 
  hockey for the Avs throughout the season Varlamov went 40146 with a 241 
  goals against average and 927 save percentage all while facing 1973 shots 
   over a 100 more than the nextclosest goaltender Bostons Tuukka Rask 
  wound up beating him for the Vezina but its hard to argue Rask made more of 
  a difference for the Bruins than Varlamov did in Colorado Varlamov stumbled a bit in the playoffs logging a 913 save percentage in the 
  series against Minnesota but its easy to forgive him for that since Colorado 
  wouldnt have made the postseason without him While watching the Avs in 201314 it was hard to believe Varlamov was the 
  same goaltender who sported a 302 GAA for Colorado during the previous 
  season If the 26yearold Russian gets injured this season or reverts to his 
  2013 form Colorado could be in real danger of missing the playoffs Roy started Varlamov 60 times last season and that number is likely to go up 
  in 201415 Backup netminder Reto Berra is there to spell Varlamov when 
  needed and nothing more Berra went 9183 with a 307 GAA in 31 games for 
  Calgary and the Avs last season but only two of those appearance came 
  following his trade to Colorado WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE  The Avalanche wont sneak up on anybody this 
  season and playing in an extremely difficult division along with Chicago and 
  St Louis makes repeating as Central champs a tough act to follow But it 
  would be truly disappointing if Colorado doesnt make it back to the playoffs 
  which is a distinct possibility considering the competition in the stacked 
  Western Conference Roy raised the bar for his young team in 201314 and it 
  could prove difficult to duplicate the shocking 112point season Colorado may 
  take a step back a year after the franchise made huge gains but it would be 
  unwise to bet against Roy and the Avs over the long term    ",2014-10-01T15:36-04:00,guns

Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/10/01/mexico-attorney-general-charges-3-soldiers-with-homicide-in-mass-killing/,"MEXICO CITY AP  Months after the Mexican army said it had killed 22 suspected gang members in a fierce shootout three soldiers are being charged with homicide The announcement late Tuesday was just another step in dismantling the official version of the June 30 confrontation which came under question almost immediately because of the lopsided outcome Only one soldier was injured But Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karams version of events raised more questions about the killings in an abandoned warehouse in southern Mexico that a witness said happened after the suspects had surrendered  and that the UN urged be investigated as possible summary executions After a brief initial firefight with eight soldiers three of them entered a warehouse where the suspects had taken refuge and opened fire with no justification whatsoever Murillo Karam said in a news conference He offered no details on whether the suspects had already surrendered whether they were unarmed or how three soldiers could kill 21 people without anyone trying to flee a wideopen hangarlike building One suspect was killed in the initial firefight according to the witness Doesnt it seem strange that eight soldiers face off against 22 suspects and all the deaths are on the side of those with numeric superiority said Alejandro Hope a Mexico Citybased security analyst What was this a squad of Rambos Or had the suspects already been disarmed Whichever way this doesnt smell good The military initially said that the prolonged confrontation occurred when a patrol unit came under fire in the town of San Pedro Limon an area in Mexico state known to be dominated by drug cartels The witness who asked that her name not be used for fear of reprisals told The AP that the army fired first She said the 21 had given up and walked out of the warehouse and that soldiers led them back inside and killed them Her daughter 15yearold Erika Gomez Gonzalez who had been wounded in the leg in the initial shootout was turned over and shot several times in the torso the witness said She said Tuesday that all of the soldiers at the scene were involved in the shooting not just three though she couldnt remember exactly how many were present Though the incident occurred three months ago she said she still hasnt been interviewed by federal investigators and by Mexicos human rights investigators just within the last two weeks The attorney generals office would not say if it had interviewed the witness and the human rights commission couldnt be immediately reached for comment An AP review of the warehouse days after the shooting showed a few stray shots and no sprays of gunfire within the large grain warehouse where the alleged gang was hiding Instead bullet holes and blood stains indicated some were shot near or against the walls at close range Photographs from the scene leaked to a local news agency showed most of the bodies against the wall with guns lying near or propped against them to appear as if they went down shooting Last week the army detained one officer and seven soldiers for disobedience and dereliction of duty in relation to the incident Those charges are separate from the attorney generals civil probe Murillo Karam said Tuesday a squad of seven soldiers and a lieutenant were involved in the killings While a battalion has about 550 soldiers normally platoons of about 30 led by a lieutenant are sent to fight drug traffickers according to a person close to the military who was not authorized to the speak to the press Murillo Karam said five of the eightman squad appeared to have stayed outside while the killings occurred He said there were doubts about one enlisted mans account that could lead to a fourth set of charges They would be formally arraigned on Wednesday he added From the start we had detected some inconsistencies he said But he did not explain why it took federal investigators 2  months to file charges His office would not say when it took the case from the prosecutor in Mexico state AP reporters revisited the bodega two weeks ago and there were no signs of a federal investigation But photographs in the national newspaper Milenio on Tuesday showed the warehouse roped off with attorney generals office caution tape and markings of the bullet holes indicating that investigators only arrived within the last two weeks Nor did Murillo Karam explain why his findings directly contradicted those of Mexico state prosecutors who said in a July 15 statement that their investigations had found an equal exchange of fire and no evidence at all of any possible execution He did not address the fact that autopsy reports on the victims have been classified as state secrets for nine years Rights groups have said the killings may prove to be one of the most serious massacres in Mexico in recent memory The civilian justice system has been totally discredited and looks very bad said Raul Benitez a security expert at Mexicos National Autonomous University It looks as if they dont perform objective investigations but rather do them for political purposes and to cover up crimes Follow us on twittercomfoxnewslatino

the Islamic State groups horrors seem closer to home She recently faced off against masked supporters of the brutal militants on her own campus I couldnt understand what was happening at first the 21yearold said of the moment she first spotted batonwielding youths striding across the Department of Literature shouting Allahu Akbar Within minutes she and other leftist students had been sucked into a fight with both sides hurling glass bottles at each other and trashing a science fair set up in the main hall     I was shocked she said The Sept 26 clash described to The Associated Press by Korkut and a half a dozen other university students was the first in a series of fights at Istanbul Universitys Beyazit campus There has been repeated violence since and Turkish media have reported scores of arrests On Monday alone 42 students were detained when police broke up a fight in a courtyard adjoining the department the staterun Anadolou Agency reported Several sticks  and a meat cleaver  were recovered from the scene Police and university officials did not return messages seeking comment The fights are one of many signs of support for the Islamic State which have popped up

or a sticker on the rear windshield of a car Others still have written about an IS gift shop  a nowempty store reported to have sold Tshirts and sportswear emblazoned with the Islamic State group emblem A recent video showing a youth wearing one such Tshirt on Istanbuls tram sent a shiver of concern across social media A few scattered sightings of Islamic State group paraphernalia in a sprawling city of 14 million people do not necessarily indicate significant support Its not clear for example to what degree the youth on the tram or the masked rioters at Istanbul University are committed supporters or just provocatively dressed sympathizers But Turkish academic Ahmet Kasim Han says theres still cause for concern Sociologically speaking it all starts with those signs he said in a recent interview at his office at Istanbuls Kadir Has University Some of those people who are declaring sympathy  might easily get radicalized The fights at Istanbul University suggest Islamic State group sympathizers arent afraid of making their presence known The brazenness is in part down to lack of a robust condemnation at the official level said Han Although the Islamic State group was designated a terror organization last year Turkish officials are still reluctant to use the term publicly Back at the bookstore Akyildiz spoke for some religiously conservative Turks when he said jihadists didnt deserve to be called terrorists For everyone the definition of terrorist is different he said According to us they are heroes The Sept 26 clash at the university started after a leftwing group put up a poster in the main hall of the Department of Literature denouncing the killings carried out by IS gangs said Korkut and others In the early afternoon masked men came to deliver an ultimatum Take the poster down or else What happened next was filmed by students who recorded the confrontation from the balconies overlooking the hall Islamic State group supporters dressed casually and with black masks and baseball caps pulled over their faces milled around on one side separated from a group of leftwing students by a barricade of folding tables grabbed from the science fair The two groups shouted at each other before hurling projectiles across the vast room Security Why are you just watching one student screamed over the sound of shattering glass Why arent you taking them away Irem Meten whose socialist student group FKF shot much of the video says the men had no trouble getting into campus even though entry requires university identification Media attention has occasionally driven hardliners into hiding The Islamic State group gift shop in Bagcilar which was in the press earlier this year is now empty save for a few bare mannequins and a religious inscription above the door Landlord Koksal Coskun says the occupants left after attracting negative attention from neighbors and police The masked attackers at Istanbul University by contrast show no sign of going underground even as Turkey inches closer to joining the USled military intervention in Syria In a statement recently published by the religiously conservative Haksoz magazine the group claiming responsibility for the skirmishes shrugged off the threat of arrest If anyone will be called to account it will not be those who wage jihad the statement said It will be the collaborators and the socalled imperialists who find refuge behind NATO the UN and the US The group did not return an email from AP seeking further comment When reporters visited the university on Sept 30 there was an undercurrent of tension About 20 riot police a few carrying submachine guns and several wearing body armor loitered outside the Literature Department Inside all appeared calm Students smoked drank tea and played ping pong Students from the universitys womens society were busy hand painting an antiIslamic State group sign Many were defiant but some were clearly worried

of the southern African kingdom as a sovereign nation While the mountainous country with a mostly rural population of 2 million plans to hold elections in February it has yet to shake the kind of concerns about military meddling in politics that have faded over the years in much of the region     The simple round huts and herds of sheep dotting the rugged countryside belie Lesothos critical importance as a source of highlands water for parched South Africa an economic heavyweight in Africa whose borders envelop the kingdom Monumental engineering feats including dams and tunnels deliver that key resource from Lesotho which has a proud narrative of independence but has sometimes been described derisively as another South African province On Aug 30 soldiers converged on some police stations a police officer was killed in a shootout radio stations went off the air and Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled to South Africa alleging he was the victim of a coup attempt The military said it was acting on information that some police planned to arm political protesters South African security forces later escorted Thabane back to the capital Maseru where political factions agreed to hold elections in February two years earlier than scheduled Lesothos governing coalition is still learning how to govern   a few months ago ministers and lawmakers visited New Zealand to study its coalition a style of government that is rare in Africa The country has been a labor pool for South Africa and has no viable economy of its own while corruption is subverting the government and the army is destabilizing and unnecessary columnist Utloang Kajeno wrote in the Lesotho Times newspaper The political and economic leverage of big brother South Africa gives it a vital role in shaping Lesothos future according to Kajeno If South Africa does not help we will forever remain that restive kingdom in its womb the columnist said South Africa however has blundered in Lesotho Some people are haunted by 1998 when violent protests and a military mutiny followed a disputed election and South African forces staged a chaotic intervention in which dozens were killed They think the same thing might happen said Stella Diedricks deputy manager of the Mohale Lodge a hotel reached over God Help Me Pass on a mountain road from Maseru that dips toward a dam with a 145meter 475foot wall The hotel still hosts delegations from Lesothos government but visits from nongovernmental organizations with international links have slowed since the recent unrest Diedricks said The US State Department had instructed nonworking family members of embassy staff to leave Lesotho but later lifted that order It noted the return of the Lesotho police to normal duty but warned that control of the army remains unresolved Local commentators say Thabane who suspended parliament in June to avoid a vote of noconfidence had feuded with his deputy Mothetjoa Metsing The police are said to have aligned with the prime minister army units are believed to have sided with his deputy There is someone somewhere who is not willing to compromise and that is hitting hard on us the people said Tello Moeketse a

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/10/06/michael-bloomberg-anti-gun-propaganda/, When former New York City Mayor Michael Bloombergs gun control groups release a report they consistently garner massive uncritical news coverage Alas With the huge number of factual mistakes in these reports you would think that reporters would have grown wary of pushing their propaganda For example Bloombergs Everytown Mothers Demand Action and Mayors Against Illegal guns have been caught padding the number of school shootings While Everytown claimed 74 school shootings occurred between the Newtown Connecticut shooting in December 2012 and June 2014 Politifact which rated Everytowns claim as mostly false put the number of incidents such as Sandy Hook or Columbine in which the shooter intended to commit mass murder at 10     Every single report released by Bloombergs groups has contained major errors A new report by the Crime Prevention Research Center has corrected Everytowns July study on mass shootings again it is no different  lots of errors but worldwide publicity touting the erroneous claims According to this Everytown study there were 110 mass shootings in the almost six years from January 2009 to July 2014 But that number is heavily padded with residential killings by gangs within family killings or murders resulting from some other crime such as a robbery These murders are also important but they are different What motivates a gang fight over drugs is not what motivates a Sandy Hook type mass shooter These mass killers plan on committing suicide While drug dealers are motivated by money the public pass shooters want to kill as many people as possible so that they can get publicity Mass public shootings that are not part of gang fight or some other crime are much fewer 25 not 110 Unfortunately Everytown hasnt learned from previous criticisms of their padded numbers with unrelated attacks Some errors are trivial such as getting the ages of killers wrong but such errors reveal the sloppiness of their reports They entirely missed the ages of 18 killers They also misclassified a couple cases of stabbings as shooting deaths Others are more significant According to their July report only 10 percent of mass shooters have a history of mental illness prior to their attacks Again they simply failed to research the cases thoroughly Out of the 25 mass public shooting cases they missed that five shooters had histories of clear mental illness Overall 52 percent of mass public shooters had histories of mental illness Perhaps most importantly the Everytown report falsely states that 86 of mass shootings occur in places where guns are allowed They arrive at their high figure primarily by counting attacks in private homes which they assume allow guns But the debate has been about attacks Further as for public places they do not correctly identify whether citizens are allowed to defend themselves Thus they ignore rules that prevent general citizens from carrying guns eg not acknowledging that Los Angeles County issued only 240 concealed handgun permits to wealthy individuals out of an adult population of 76 million adults They equate allowing police to carry guns as the same thing as letting civilians defend themselves And they mistakenly rely on news reports to determine whether guns were banned in an area Unfortunately the media virtually never mentions that attacks occur in gunfree zones In fact since 2009 indeed since at least 1950 only two of the mass public shootings have occurred in places where civilians were allowed to defend themselves with guns  Everytown asserts that attacks involving assault weapons were more deadly 77 with assault weapons versus 47 without Correcting their simple math errors no longer counting stabbing deaths as shootings and consistently defining assault rifles cuts the difference to 64 versus 49 Even then the difference is driven by just one attack For all the other mass shootings but Newtown the lethality of attacks with assault weapons is actually slightly less than attacks without them With all the hundreds of millions of dollars that Michael Bloomberg is poring into pushing gun control you would think that he could hire some factcheckers But possibly he doesnt care Maybe all he really wants is antigun propaganda  John R Lott Jr is a columnist forFoxNewscom He is an economist and was formerly chief economist at the United States Sentencing Commission Lott is also a leading expert on guns and opeds on that issue are done in conjunction with the Crime Prevention Research Center He is the author of eight books including More Guns Less Crime His latest book is Dumbing Down the Courts How Politics Keeps the Smartest Judges Off the Bench Bascom Hill Publishing Group September 17 2013 Follow him on Twitterjohnrlottjr  FollowFoxNewsOpinion on Facebook,2014-10-06T16:11-04:00,guns
Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/10/05/us-doing-everything-it-can-contain-ebola-secret-service-attempting-overcome-its-scandals/, This is a rush transcript from Fox News Sunday October 5 2014 This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated CHRIS WALLACE HOST Im Chris Wallace     The Dallas Ebola patient is now in critical condition Is our government doing everything it can BEGIN VIDEOTAPE LISA MONACO HOMELAND SECURITY AND COUNTERTERRORISM ADVISOR Every Ebola outbreak over the past 40 years has been stopped We know how to do this and we will do it again WALLACE Well have the latest developments Well talk with the man in charge of the response in Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins who personally escorted the family of the Ebola patient to new living quarters And well pose the questions youre asking to the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr Anthony Fauci Then a shakeup at the Secret Service after a number of shocking security failures REP DARRELL ISSA RCALIF How much would it cost to lock the front door of the White House JULIA PIERSON FORMER SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR Its clear our security plan was not properly executed This is unacceptable and I take full responsibility WALLACE Whats next for the agency charged with keeping our president safe Well ask a member of the Senate Homeland Security Community Kelly Ayotte and one of the President Obamas former Secret Service agents Dan Bongino Plus with growing concerns over Ebola the Secret Service and the VA and IRS scandals can we trust the federal government to do its job Our Sunday panel weighs in All right now on Fox News Sunday END VIDEOTAPE WALLACE And hello again from FOX News in Washington That Liberian man who became the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the US is now in critical condition in a Dallas hospital Meanwhile at Newark New Jersey airport health officials who met a plane landing Saturday with a sick Liberian passenger have now cleared him Well talk with two of the governments point men in dealing with the Ebola threat in a moment But first FOX News senior national correspondent John Roberts joins us from Atlanta with the latest  John JOHN ROBERTS FOX NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT Chris good morning to you And the fact that Thomas Eric Duncan is now in critical condition is not a good sign None of the other US patients who survived ever became critical And as doctors fight to save Duncans life after some serious slipups public health officials now say they are making progress in their efforts to control the virus in Dallas BEGIN VIDEOTAPE ROBERTS voiceover After an exhaustive fourday search health officials announced they had circled the net around people Thomas Eric Duncan may have come in contact with DR THOMAS FRIEDEN CDC DIRECTOR We have identified in conjunction with the folks on the ground in Texas nine individuals who were pretty sure are definite contacts with the source patient There are about 40 other people that we cant rule out had contact ROBERTS Officials also finally moved to clean up the apartment where Duncans family members were ordered to stay quarantined but not until they had lived with his soiled clothing and bedding for nearly a week Despite years of preparation for such an event the Health Department was unable to find a contractor or the proper permits to dispose of hazardous waste That was just one of the many balls dropped with this case The biggest when Duncan first went to the hospital on September 25th and was sent home despite telling ER workers he had recently arrived from Liberia DR MARK LESTER EXEC VP TEXAS HEALTH RESOURCES Regretfully that information was not fully communicated throughout the full team ROBERTS Hospital officials blamed a flaw in their patient data sharing systems The first was when Duncan left Liberia According to Liberian officials he marked no on a questionnaire asking if hed been in contact with an Ebola patient Neighbors say he had helped a woman dying from Ebola four days earlier The White House believes current screening methods for travelers are adequate That in the face of what happened in the hospital is renewing calls to fully log and communicate a patients history SYLVIA BURWELL HHS SECRETARY What we are doing is making sure that hospitals health workers across the country know that when they see that what steps to take how to isolate and what to do immediately when they see those steps END VIDEOTAPE ROBERTS The surveillance system worked as it should yesterday when a man who had become ill with Ebolalike symptoms was taken off the United Airlines flight that just arrived at Newark airport from Brussels It turns out he did not have Ebola just a different type of virus But Chris ultimately the goal is to prevent ill people from West Africa from getting on those planes in the first place  Chris WALLACE John Roberts reporting from Atlanta  John thanks for that Now lets go to ground zero for a potential Ebola outbreak here in the US Dallas Texas Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins is the man leading the emergency response there On Friday he escorted the family to Thomas Duncan was staying with to a temporary home for their quarantine and he did it without wearing any protective gear Judge Jenkins heres the question why did you do that Why did you come in close contact with the people who were in closest contact with Thomas Duncan without any protective gear And honestly did you have no fears about catching Ebola JENKINS Chris I wanted that family to be treated the way I would want my family treated if I were in the hospital and they were worried about my safety and catching this virus I wanted to treat them as human beings not as a space man in some sort of a protective suit I was assured by our top  states top health officials and the CDC that it was safe to do it the way I did it and I know the family appreciated us doing it in that way Im glad that we got them out of a situation where I was unhappy to see that family living in the situation they were living in and they are now thanks to someone who stepped up in the faith community at my request and worked out the details with Mayor Mike Rawlings and also his request now theyre at a place I would be satisfied to have my own family WALLACE You think they were safe and health officials say they were safe because theyre not symptomatic at this point and therefore they cant transmit the virus But it seems to me and maybe Im  I dont want to put words in your mouth that you were making a statement about the real threat of Ebola Are some people in the Dallas area  with all the talk about Thomas Duncan and about these 40 people youre monitoring are some people in the Dallas area understandably if perhaps unreasonably panicking JENKINS Theres panic out there amongst people but there are a lot of heroes involved in this and there are a lot of people who arent panicking You got 2 12 million people in Dallas and the  its a mixed bag of how people are dealing with this but the science is clear I think a picture is worth a thousand words both to Louise and the three young men and also to the public who saw that These are people made in the image of God I am not going to expose myself to Ebola and take that home to my own family Im not going to ask my first responders to do anything that I wouldnt do myself Were going to do everything in our power to keep you safe and you are safe WALLACE Public health officials as John Roberts just reported are now tracking somewhere between 40 and 50 people who had some kind of sensible  I mean serious contact with Thomas Duncan How are you monitoring them And how are you going to monitor them over what could be two or three weeks JENKINS The highrisk individuals are monitored by CDC or county or both EP ph team twice a day with temperature checks and full protocol The lowrisk individuals are monitored once a day on a selfcheck with a  taking their temperature and once a day by our team WALLACE Judge Jenkins were going to have to leave it there I want to thank you so much for joining us today and for all youre doing in Dallas to try to alleviate concerns and take care of the public health situation there Thank you sir JENKINS Thank you Chris WALLACE Now lets bring in one of the nations top public health officials leading the fight against Ebola Dr Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr Fauci welcome back to Fox News Sunday DR ANTHONY FAUCI DIRECTOR NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES Thank you Chris WALLACE Lets start first of all with this  the one known case we have in this country Thomas Duncan downgraded to critical condition What kind of shape is he in And what do we know about the treatment hes getting FAUCI Well first of all the most important treatment is good medical care because one of the areas where people get into trouble they have diarrhea theyre vomiting they lose fluid they get electrolyte imbalance Getting IVs acute critical care is what we have With regard to experimental drugs theyre all experimental Chris ZMapp the one that Kent Brantly got and Nancy Writebol is just not available There are other experimental drugs Im not sure if hes getting them but the crux and the critical sure of caring for this person is good intensivecare medicine WALLACE Do we know what shape hes in I MEAN FAUCI I dont know personally but the hospital is saying that hes in critical condition He went from critical to serious And now theyre saying hes back in critical This is what were hearing from the hospital WALLACE We talked with Judge Jenkins just a moment ago about the 50 people that public health officials are monitoring To the best of your knowledge have any of them shown any signs of developing Ebola symptoms And quite frankly what are the chances that one or more of them are going to come down with Ebola FAUCI Well to my knowledge no but again I dont have privy knowledge of that Its important because the crux of preventing an outbreak in Dallas or any place else is to do exactly what the CDC and Dallas is doing monitoring patients on a twiceaday basis If they get febrile then you isolate them and you put them under the protocol of caring for an Ebola patient Your question about what the chances are we dont know but I would not be surprised Chris if someone who had very close contact with Mr Duncan actually comes down with Ebola The encouraging thing about is that person that small group of risk people are being very closely monitored And if in fact they start to develop symptoms theyll be put under the circumstance of not being ability to spread it to other people WALLACE Lets talk about some of the question people are asking and Im almost going to do this as a lightning round with quick questions quick answers These are the questions some you may think are sensible some you may think are not but these are the questions that folks are asking British Airlines have suspended all flights to and from the infected areas in Africa Should the US do the same And should we impose a visa ban on anybody coming from those three countries in West Africa FAUCI No in my opinion absolutely not Chris Because when you start closing off countries like that theres a real danger of making things worse You isolate them You can cause unrest in the country Its conceivable that governments could fall if you isolate them completely Importantly you cant get supplies in and out They need help They need equipment and they need health care workers to come in WALLACE But forgive me I mean Ive heard that argument You could send equipment and medicine and health workers in  FAUCI Right WALLACE  without taking thousands of passengers out FAUCI Thats true But experience is when you close such a country you create such stress and fear and amplify the problem So I think any health care person will agree with me that thats not a good idea to completely block off the country WALLACE But theres another side of this How effective is the screenings Since these new guidelines were imposed in Liberia in July when the outbreak started 10000 people have flown out of the Liberia to other countries Only two of those people have been subjected to additional screening And theyre just screened for a fever They could have a fever from a cold from a flu whatever Two of 10000 And then I want to show you this pictures of a man an American doctor who came into Atlanta airport wearing a hazmat suit  Im sure youve seen this picture with  on the back it says CDC is lying He says when he arrived from Guatemala the only questions he was asked were are you carrying tobacco or alcohol FAUCI Right WALLACE And how effective is the screening over there And how effective is it here FAUCI The best way to avoid someone getting on a plane who is  has Ebola is to do the exit screening You get your temperature taken and you get a questionnaire Now obviously youre not going to be 100 percent riskfree WALLACE But when you get 2 of 10000 FAUCI Yes but Im not sure what you mean 2 of 10000 WALLACE There were 10000 people who have left Liberia and have been screened since July 26 FAUCI Right WALLACE Only two have been subjected to additional screening FAUCI Right because they got on the plane and they were not infected  they were not symptomatic And when youre not symptomatic youre not going to spread it WALLACE But just out of a random group of 10000 wouldnt you think more than two would have a fever FAUCI Well  WALLACE Im not saying Ebola but a fever period FAUCI Of course they wouldnt have gotten on the plane so if you had fever for Ebola or any other reason So if you go to Monrovia airport you arrive and you have Malaria and somebody gets the gun and shows you have fever youre not getting on the plane Thats the thing that people need to understand If you have symptoms or fever you will not be allowed on the plane WALLACE What are the chances  another question  what are the chances that illegal immigrants are going to come over our porous southern border with Ebola or the terrorists will purposely send someone here using Ebola as a bioterror weapon FAUCI OK two plots to the question I wouldnt be worrying about illegal immigrants coming from southern borders when we have an issue right now with Ebola in West Africa I mean thats a hypothetical thats very farfetched As far as terrorism nature right now Chris is the worst bioterrorist Im worried more about the natural evolution in West African than I am about a terrorist WALLACE I also suppose if youre going to do a bioterror weapon Ebola isnt the most effective one FAUCI That would not be  if I were a bioterrorist that would not be my choice WALLACE Because it doesnt  FAUCI No it would be inefficient Nature does it much worse than a bioterrorist WALLACE How long do bodily fluids stay dangerous If I got Ebola and Im sweating and touch a doorknob or I touch this tabletop how long are the dangerous germs going to stay there FAUCI We dont know exactly how because its very difficult to test that under the circumstances of which Ebola exists We do know that a its a relatively fragile virus If you take something like anthrax which is a microorganism that has a spore it can be for days weeks a long time Its fragile We certainly know isnt just minutes because people can get it from funerals from touching the body Now the issue is when you say well what about touching things that are contaminated the experience with 38 years of Ebola is that it is rarely if ever transmitted in a way whether you might touch something two days later and wind up getting infected So the experience tells us even though its a hypothetical that it could be spread that way people always think of door knobs and things By experience thats not happened WALLACE You and other officials keep saying flatly theres no way that Ebola can be spread through the air It has to be direct contact with bodily fluids But Michael Osterholm the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research at the University of Minnesota wrote this and we put it up on the screen The second possibility is one that virologists are loath to discuss openly but are definitely considering in private that an Ebola virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air The current Ebola viruss hyper evolution is unprecedented theres been more human to human transmission in the past four months than most likely occurred in the last 500 to 1000 years I mean what he seems to be saying is Ebola is already doing things we didnt think it could do How solid is the science that it wont be able to make this jump FAUCI Well Im not loath to discuss it publicly and I will discuss it with you Certainly hypothetically anything can happen But if you look at the track record of viruses viruses mutate and they change They could become more virulent less virulent It is extremely rare if not unprecedented that a mutation will occur to completely make it transmitted by a way it never transmitted before Is it theoretically possible Yes Is it likely No WALLACE Finally we got a little over a minute left What do you want to say to our viewers  I dont have to tell you Im sure you come in contact with a lot of people who are just scared Its a deadly disease it has no cure What do you say to them FAUCI Right Well the people who are scared I say we dont take lightly your fear we respect it we understand it But we have to get our actions and our policies based on scientific evidence We know that if you do isolation contact tracing and appropriate treatment you will not have an outbreak There may be another person that will come to the United States with Ebola We may have another situation like that But because of our health care system and our ability to do the contact tracing and isolation we wont have an outbreak West Africa is not the United States Unfortunately those people there because of the weaknesses of their health system are having an outbreak That wont happen It could be well see another case but we wont have an outbreak WALLACE Dr Fauci thank you Thanks for taking time out of your very busy schedule to come answer our questions today I appreciate it sir FAUCI Good to be with you Chris WALLACE Up next with Ebola now in the US  a breakdown at the Secret Service and other failures are we starting to lose faith in our government Our Sunday group joins the conversation Plus what would you like to ask the panel Just go to Facebook or Twitter FoxNewsSunday And we may use your question on the air COMMERCIAL BREAK BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JOSH EARNEST WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY We retain confidence in the sophisticated medical infrastructure of the United States of America to respond to meet the needs of those individuals that have contracted Ebola and to put protocols in place that will prevent an Ebola epidemic from striking the United States END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE White House spokesman Josh Earnest trying to reassure the public the Obama administration has the Ebola threat under control And its time now for our Sunday group Brit Hume FOX News senior political analyst Julie Pace who covers the White House for The Associated Press Syndicated columnist George Will And FOX News political analyst Juan Williams Julie this Ebola scares comes on top of the shocking security breach involving the Secret Service the ISIS rise which President Obama says surprised him problems of either incompetence or corruption at the IRS and the VA do the White House officials you talk to worry about people losing confidence in the competence of this administration JULIE PACE THE ASSOCIATED PRESS I think they do I think that they can trace this back even beyond these incidents that you laid out that are more recent I mean we have seen this for several years when you look at polling most Americans its upwards of 60 percent 70 percent think that this country is headed in the wrong direction And thats just more than economic numbers or maybe whats happening overseas Its a sense that the government simply cant handle major problems Now the White House would point to steps that they are taking to try to prevent Ebola from becoming an outbreak here You heard about Dr Fauci talk about some of those things You know having the director of the Secret Service replaced relatively quickly in order to try to reform that agency But again if youre an American out there in the country and you look at all of these things that are happening you cant help but question your governments ability to manage them WALLACE Well we got questions like that We asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on Twitter from Jason Brown Have no faith in Obama administration doing anything important Wont close border or quarantine country so how are they protecting Brit beyond Ebola how do you answer Jason when it comes to Ebola or the Secret Service when it comes to the basic functions  not policy  basic functions of government BRIT HUME FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST Its not just these failings and examples of incompetence and scandal that are feeding this It is also the response to them or one might say the lack of them I was just on these recent issues  Jeh Johnson the head of the Department of Homeland Security was on this channel on Friday night being interviewed by Bret Baier at some length And he seems like a very nice man His answers were a catalogue of evasions and bland assurances that everything is being done and so on And I dont think that works I think whats needed at a time like this when a government is going to respond in a competent and effective way is brutal candor and a sense right away that things are being done to change everything So Julia Pierson she hangs around in her job the morning she testifies the White House is saying we have full confidence in her Well she was gone by the end of the day basically because she was  her testimony was so unreassuring WALLACE Or Eric Shinseki who some people say testified with all the passion of somebody ordering Chinese dinner HUME Exactly I mean it was all  its a sense that while the public is alarmed people within the administration with responsibilities in all these areas are not particularly alarmed You had that with the IRS as well repeated assurances from senior officials This goes on all the time Now sometimes something like this will happen and youll get an early assurance but as this administration goes on and on and on and it communicates the sense the not only things are wrong but were not fixing them WALLACE You know this of course ends up going to the top man and some conservatives are even beginning to compare Barack Obama to Jimmy Carter and the famous malaise speech from 1979 Juan is that fair JUAN WILLIAMS FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST Oh my gosh You know what Julie said is right weve had polls now I think more than a decade that show when you look at right trackwrong track people think the country is going in the wrong track people there are problems in the society But at the moment I think what were doing here really is were approaching the stretch run of the midterm selections Employment is down as we saw on Friday Stocks are up I think that the United States is  you know health care ObamaCare is not working as a campaign issue for the Republicans I think if you go beyond that were in the Middle East fighting ISIS in the way that Republicans suggested  WALLACE So youre saying this is all politics WILLIAMS Well I think if theres no GOP wave its a very close election and I think what you have now is people are saying oh my gosh can we blame Ebola on Obama Oh what about the Secret Service as if he would put his own family at risk and that their incompetence is related to him The GOP brand is in trouble Congress is in trouble CROSSTALK HUME He asked you a different question WILLIAMS I answered the question HUME Yes he didnt ask about the GOP or the Democrats  WILLIAMS I know no one wants to  but when you talk about the crisis of confidence weve had an ongoing crisis of confidence in this country with regard to major institutions from Wall Street to the White House  HUME You think its worsened in recent years WILLIAMS Oh do I think at the moment its worse No I mean I think  HUME Things are about the same WILLIAMS You know if I look at the polls which is what I do I see the polls indicate in fact the crisis  the level of people saying were going the wrong direction is about what its always been  CROSSTALK HUME What about the level of people saying that the government is not competent WILLIAMS People always say that The Social Security checks go out The government  HUME They dont always say that WILLIAMS And yet people say I hate government That is like  thats all American We all say it WALLACE George GEORGE WILL SYNDICATED COLUMNIST They say that because government is not competent Frankly its not competent under Republicans or under Democrats It is always a monopoly and monopolies are not disciplined by market forces that connect them with reality Teasing this segment you said can we have faith in government I think we have much more to fear from excessive faith in government than from too little faith in government You asked can we trust the government to do its job What isnt its job nowadays I just made a list of it Its finetuning the curriculum of our students K through 12 Its monitoring sex on campuses Its deciding how much ethanol we should put in our gas tanks It has designed our light bulbs and its worried sick over the name of the Washington football team Now this is a government that doesnt know when to stop The distilled essence and here I get partisan my friend the distilled  WILLIAMS All right all right But I will say thats a small government argument and I appreciate it WILL The distilled essence of progressivism is that government is a benign  that is disinterested force thats false And b it is stocked with experts who are really gifted at doing things Republicans do this also Democrats do it in domestic policy The Republicans brought us nationbuilding and regime change A common theme is the excessive faith in the skills of government WALLACE So now that we have brought the politics into this Julie are they worried that this could play a role in the November midterms PACE I think they worry that it could contribute to perhaps low turnout more than anything else I dont think they dont see this polling right now that Ebola or Secret Service in particular is showing up in affecting how people vote but if you have Americans who just dont feel like their government is effective were able to play a role in solving problems they worry that that will keep them from voting at all And in a lot of these races particularly on the Senate side if Democrats are going to be able to hold their seats they need large turnouts WALLACE I just want to double back because we have a little time left here Juan events have consequences just like Hurricane Katrina and the poor response had an impact a shadow on the rest of the Bush administration Dont things like a person being able to get in the front door of the White House somebody shooting seven times at the White House and they didnt find out about it until the weekend under the janitors started clearing up doesnt that have an impact on peoples faith in government WILLIAMS Yes it does I think George made the point too that  look people think that government is not always acting competently speedily that in fact theres a lot of bumbling and theres often a lot of defense I think Brit spoke to this They give you these sort of vacuous statements about how things are going dont you worry And people  WALLACE Mistakes were made Thats my favorite WILLIAMS Yes thats ridiculous But to say that that is now political is where I think that we go a step too far because as George said you see this on the part of Republicans and Democrats And the problem here is the deterioration of faith in American institutions that I worry about because I am someone who believes in democracy  CROSSTALK WALLACE Final word George WILL The last time there was a sustained surge of confidence in governments competence was under Ronald Reagan who said the government is going to do less but its going to do it right WILLIAMS But what did he do George WILL Won the cold war WILLIAMS He grew the size of government WALLACE We are not going to relitigate the Reagan years although it would be a pretty interesting conversation although it would be a pretty interesting conversation Some of us were around for it Sorry Julie Thanks panel Well see you a little later So what do you think How confident are you in the way that government is handling the Ebola outbreak Do you feel safe Let me know on Facebook or Twitter FoxNewsSunday And use the FNS Up next a series of stunning breaches forces the head of the Secret Service to step down Well discuss the real safety of the president with one of his former agents and Senator Kelly Ayotte next COMMERCIAL BREAK WALLACE The Secret Service is the key line of defense between the president and any threat to his life but a shocking series of lapses from a fence jumper making it inside the White House to a security guard with a gun on the presidents elevator led to the agencys director being forced out this week as well as plans for a fullscale investigation Joining us to discuss where the Secret Service goes from here in New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte a member of the Homeland Security Committee and here in Washington Dan Bongino one of President Obamas former Secret Service agents whos written a book Life Inside the Bubble Dan let me start with you as a former agent and after all the things youve heard in the last few weeks do you still have full confidence honestly in the Secret Services ability to protect the president no matter where he goes DAN BONGINO FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT The rank and file agents officers men and women yes the upperlevel management absolutely not I think they have failed the men and women and the results are frightening WALLACE I was going to say and if youve got people out on the frontline who are you know as the quote goes willing to take a bullet for the president but theyre being failed by their top management does that create problems in the security for the president BONGINO Of course And youre seeing the results of it Ive said to a number of folks that you cant view these security failures in a vacuum Its not just that the dog wasnt released These all fit into a larger management problem this insulated cabal at the top that has nearly abandoned the rank and file and what youre seeing now Chris is a near mutiny with the agents Theres a reason all of these whistleblowers are appearing I assure you Its not by accident They feel like they have no one to go to and they feel like theyve been abandoned by the upper level bureaucracy WALLACE Were going to pick up on that I want to bring in Senator Ayotte The same questions bucking ph both of us the rank and file but also about the top management who ends up running things Is the agency capable at this time of protecting the president SEN KELLY AYOTTE RNH Well we appreciate the agents themselves and their brave service I think there is clearly a leadership problem It goes beyond the head of the agency It goes to the culture of the agency the command structure and if you look at these incidents Chris there seems to be a training issue Also there needs to be a review of the rules of engagement and then there was astonishing lack of attention to detail that seems to need to be the focus I think this needs a fresh view like the VA and an independent review WALLACE Dan you talked about a cabal at the top you talked about a mutiny of agents What are you talking about BONGINO Theres a small group of upper level management that grew up together lets say within the Secret Service and the problem is they are married to the way things used to be done Chris Well the threat footprint has changed The world has evolved Its almost become that theyve used the Secret Services small group and there are good managers there these small groups as almost like a job search service for their secondary careers And the problem with that is the rankandfile agents feel like the allegiance of the management is not to them but to say someone maybe the DHS secretary who later on they can go into business with together Its created significant problems and a distrust And in our business trust is all that matters WALLACE I want to pick up on that for you Dan and Im going to bring the Senator Ayotte into it Because a number of people we talked to this week say that one of the key turning points was for the agency was in 2003 when the Secret Service was moved from an elite agency inside the Treasury Department to the Department of Homeland Security where its just one in a number of fiefdoms And I guess the question is how big a problem is that the fact that its now in a different agency and one of a number of agencies within this kind of in undefined department and also the fact that its responsibility is split not only protection but also investigating cybercrime and financial fraud and a bunch of other things BONGINO Well two points to that Your first question the DHS bureaucracy has suffocated the Secret Service They were largely left alone in the Treasury Department the joke the agents used to say among themselves were that we were a big fish in a small pond in Treasury now we are a guppy in an ocean Secondly the dual mission The dual mission is a vestigial relict from their founding It pains me to say it I loved federal investigations of financial crimes the agents do as well but Chris theres just not enough money in a growingly sparse taxpayer environment for them to handle these dual missions Listen were in an errorfree environment with protection You cannot screw up once Theres just not enough money or time or resource to handle this dual mission anymore WALLACE But Senator Ayotte the Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson the man in charge of this big department including the Secret Service was on special report on Friday and heres what he had to say on this very issue BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JEH JOHNSON SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY I think that it makes a tremendous amount of sense for the Secret Service to be under the umbrella of a department that has a homeland security counter terrorism law enforcement mission END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE Senator is Secretary Johnson wrong AYOTTE Well hes not wrong given the threats that we face around the world and that some of those obviously could be directed at our president as the commanderinchief However I do think that as we evaluate this we need to look at whether that bureaucracy is hampering the primary purpose of the Secret Service So I think thats something the Homeland Security Committee should absolutely evaluate to determine whether or not there is enough focus going back to the issues that I mentioned originally where is the training Where is the command structure The culture within the agency And I think that that will have to be evaluated but clearly they have to defend the president in a context of the threats we face around the world Thats whats so troubling about what happened here Because this is obviously an obvious scenario of a fence jumping What about a more sophisticated scenario WALLACE Do you have as someone who is the head of  rather on the committee that oversees Secret Service you dont get to confirm the appointee that is a decision by the president Do you have an idea for a replacement as the head of Secret Service AYOTTE I dont at this point but I do think it needs to be a fresh view of whats happening at the Secret Service not someone who is ingrained in the culture there existing now As Dan mentioned in terms of the hierarchy so I hope that is what the president will consider just like he did with the VA WALLACE We also you talk about culture we also had this remarkable scene Wednesday where White House spokesman Josh Earnest expressed full confidence in Secret Service Director Julia Pierson in the morning and then just hours later hours later saying that he INAUDIBLE she was out Take a look BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JOSH EARNEST WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN Shes more than qualified to do her job She is somebody who has a very difficult responsibility Over the last several days weve seen recent and accumulating reports raising questions about the performance of the agency and the president concluded that new leadership of that agency was required END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE Again that is a difference between Thursday morning and Thursday afternoon  or rather Wednesday Dan is there a basic lack of accountability inside the Secret Service BONGINO There is with the upperlevel management The ombudsman program for example Chris to give you a tangible example where the agents  supposedly can go to air grievances related to the security footprint The program is a disaster What would happen is you would see people in that program and information would slip out so you really werent an anonymous whistleblower They could really use an outside independent ombudsman and it could  they should take the inspections program out from within the Secret Service and make it independent kind of like an Internal Affairs Bureau so the agents feel like they have a voice when they see an obvious security failure WALLACE Senator Ayotte you are also a member of the Senate Armed Service Committee and I want to switch subjects on you Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has a new book out in which he blasts President Obama for failing to push Iraq to keep a residual force of US troops there after 2011 Panetta writes this those on our side  talking about the Pentagon  those on our side viewed the White House as so eager to rid itself of Iraq that it was willing to withdraw rather than lock in arrangements that would preserve our influence and interests Now President Obama says that this was Iraqs decision not his What do you make of Panettas remarks and how big a role if you believe what he says did that play in the fact that were now facing this threat from ISIS AYOTTE Well I think that Secretary Panetta absolutely I have respect for him and the military commanders clearly wanted to leave a residual force there That the presidents claim that this was all in the Iraqis does not withstand scrutiny And I think what we have here Chris as a problem where the presidents foreign policy is being trapped by his campaign rhetoric And Im very fearful that as we look at the current military strategy that it is surrounding the November elections and that he wont have the resolve to follow through with what needs to be done in a sustained effort to destroy ISIS and were about to repeat the same thing with regard to Afghanistan which Secretary Panetta also mentions in his book as well WALLACE I just want to follow up we have a couple of minutes up Are you suggesting that after the November election and acting tough and talking tough that he is going to pull back from confronting ISIS AYOTTE Im very concerned about that Chris and his resolve in this regard And I think thats something that as a member of the Armed Services Committee weve got to stay focused on And if you look at the pattern here  I mean look at what happened in Libya We engaged in airstrikes and then none of the followon in terms of securing the weapons and obviously what happened with our embassy I think we need to ensure that this isnt just surrounding what were doing now He has made clear this is going to take a sustained effort And he has to be prepared to have the resolve to engage in that sustained effort to destroy ISIS Otherwise were going to be in a situation where we have a safe haven again where attacks can be launched against us WALLACE Senator Ayotte Dan Bongino thank you both thanks for coming in today and talking with us AYOTTE Thank you WALLACE When we come back our Sunday group digs in to Leon Panettas explosive charge Did President Obama ignore advice from his top military officials And is that why we now face the threat from ISIS COMMERCIAL BREAK WALLACE Now you can connect with Fox News Sunday on Facebook and Twitter Be sure to

SUNDAY COMMERCIAL BREAK BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JEN PSAKI STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESWOMAN I think the Iraqi government it would not have mattered They didnt want to have troops in Iraq They werent willing to take the steps needed END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE State Department spokesman Jen Psaki pushing back on former Defense Secretary Panettas charge President Obama could have pushed the Iraqis to allow US troops to stay in Iraq but that the president wanted out And were back now with the panel Julie Panetta makes a number of tough charges in his new book about the presidents policies he says not only that Mr Obama could have pressured the Iraqis to leave the residual force in Iraq but really didnt want to He also says that the president sent a terrible message by drawing the red line on Assad using chemical weapons in Syria and then failing to enforce the red line How do White House officials react to this man who the president appointed first to be CIA director and then to be the Pentagon chief saying these kinds of things about his former boss PACE It puts the White House in an incredibly tough spot Because this is Leon Panetta who is widely respected in Washington WALLACE And a Democrat PACE A Democrat Someone who the president obviously trusted deeply So you are not going to see a lot of public pushback against Leon Panetta personally It certainly irks them in the context that were in right now and this  this issue as you start with Jen Psaki on Iraq and what happened there you know it is really problematic for them Because it is true that the Iraqis would not give US troops immunity to stay in the country And that is something that any US president would require It is also true though that the president of the United States was looking to get out of Iraq And after it became clear that there was going to be no deal he went out and sold that as a policy victory of fulfillment of his political promise And what Panetta and others have said is that it appears as though his desire to get out of Iraq shifts the way in the amount of effort that he put into negotiate WALLACE And Iraq still has a feeling that he could have  you know we were giving  continuing to give aid to Iraq There were a lot of levers he could have pulled if he wanted to to force the Malaki government to cave in but frankly he was very willing to take no for an answer PACE Maliki  Maliki at a certain point when it became clear that the Iraqi parliament was not going to grant US troops immunity Maliki floated an idea about signing an executive order where he could guarantee immunity and that did not fly with the Obama administration WALLACE You know this is not the only case of this because the first Obama Defense Secretary Robert Gates he also wrote a book in which he says in his memoir that the president never believed in his troop surge in Afghanistan and from the start only cared about getting out of there George this is not between Panetta and Gates very flattering stuff to say about our commanderinchief WILL Its not but the president could counter another description of what Ive done is keeping my campaign promise Because he did campaign on getting out of both countries So he could in fact say what Ive done I had a mandate to do The question is I suppose Panetta says we didnt leave enough people to preserve our interests and influence I think a lot of people say what influence did we have What influence could we have had with still 10000 or 15000 troops out there And what is our real interest in the Middle East now at this point anyway WALLACE There is a consistent theme though youre hearing from some of the presidents closest national security advisers I mean I think you would agree Panetta and Gates are about as close as it gets for the first what four five years of President Obamas term And you heard it obviously from a critic Kelly Ayotte Senator from New Hampshire that the president cared more about the campaign promises about his policy his ideology and the politics than he did about what some of these very trusted advisers said was in the best security interest for the country WILLIAMS And no need to say its not only the case Chris that these were trusted advisers but these are good people these are you know for my money being around Washington these are the kind of guys you want in charge So I trust them I find them admirable people but I will say this that I think theres more to foreign policy than military or intelligence options Their job is to present the president with reasonable steps that he could take in the military portfolio and intelligence portfolio Theyre economic options they are diplomatic options The president has to consider them all And I think these gentlemen as theyre selling their books you know put out  I told the president I would have done this but for example arming the Syrian rebels I mean thats a very iffy deal We didnt know exactly  CROSSTALK WALLACE Wait a minute so were not doing that right now WILLIAMS Were doing it now because things have changed The whole situation has rather been changed PACE For the better WILLIAMS For the worse HUME So arming the Syrian rebels was a terrible idea before things got this bad and now were going to rely on them to be our ground forces And  CROSSTALK HUME  to take down ISIS and thats a good idea WILLIAMS If I had President Hume on the horn and I said President Hume given what happened in Afghanistan with the Mujahedeen and who turned into al Qaeda do you want to harm these guys Do we know that these guys are in fact not al Qaeda reinvented Not ISIS HUME The point is that its now the presidents policy WILLIAMS No because now we are going after ISIS per se and we know the rebels the people we can identify who are opposed to ISIS Thats a different scenario HUME Maybe Chris I would add to this note a bit I think its beginning to look more and more as if our effort against ISIS is everybody is much inspired by politics and a nearing election as was the previous efforts in Iraq The bombing campaign appears to be anything but really intense Maybe it cant be because we lack the intelligence to select the proper targets and the proper number to really do damage It does not appear to have greatly retarded ISISs progress It looks like a quite mild bombing campaign undertaken for the purpose of appearing to do something toward the goal the president says of ultimately taking down ISIS My sense is that after this  after he gets past this election his effort to take down ISIS I dont think its something he deeply believes in I dont think he could possibly believe in the approach that hes taken will subside as Kelly Ayotte fears WALLACE Really You think that this is going to  just disappear HUME I think it will  I dont think first of all I think militarily the plan is so suspect that it probably cant do very much And I dont think the president particularly wants it to WALLACE Julie how  with the White  I mean I had honestly before Kelly Ayotte I hadnt heard that claim before the idea  this is sort of the October or September surprise and it will disappear it will go away after the election Is that something that PACE Its also something I have heard I mean I think that you have to look at this in the context of Barack Obama deciding to take military action in general and how reluctant he is then to do that I think for him to take this on and then to just abandon it I dont see that as being something that he would do because I think it took so much for him to take that step in the first place I think he would have much preferred if he could have found ways to go after the Islamic State group without taking military action I think if they are going to be effective though they certainly are going to have to keep doing a bombing campaign and perhaps step up the targets HUME And more WALLACE But remember this is the president who at West Point announced the Afghanistan troop surge in one sentence and in the next sentence said when were going to get out So its not beyond him to set real limits on how involved hes going to be PACE I think  I think one of the things to watch is whether the  involvement from the Arab states continues took because the Arab states have a lot  have a lot of stake in this Having joined up on this operation for them to back off immediately would also be troublesome for them WALLACE George youre shaking your head like even for the INAUDIBLE a fools errand WILL We could  theres bombing and then theres bombing We bombed Iraq intermittently and steadily throughout much of the 1990s to no particular effect We still INAUDIBLE have another war with them I recommend that people read something in The Washington Post this morning by Andrew Basovich He is a professor at Columbia University he lost a son in Iraq Hes entitled to speak He makes the point that since 1980 we have bombed or occupied or invaded or all three 14 Islamic nations Thats may be just about enough and he does worry that theres something called threat inflation at work here that we need to be a little more clearsighted about how much those guys in their INAUDIBLE pickup trucks with their machine guns riveted to the base of the truck threaten the country WALLACE And on that happy note thank you panel Well see you next week Well be back with a final note in a moment and a very special guest COMMERCIAL BREAK WALLACE Well thats it for a packed program As you may know were the official Sunday show of the Washington Nationals in their quest for the World Series Last night they lost 21 to the San Francisco Giants in the longest playoff game in history and they now trail the fivegame series two games to none Weve been counting on our lucky INAUDIBLE garden gnome to help us

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/10/04/with-all-eyes-on-syria-iraq-shiites-leap-to-position-strength-in-yemen/,SANAA Yemen  The capital of Yemen the Arab worlds poorest and perhaps most chronically unstable nation has new masters AntiAmerican Shiite rebels man checkpoints and roam the streets in pickups mounted with antiaircraft guns The fighters control almost all state buildings from the airport and the central bank to the Defense Ministry Only a few police officers and soldiers are left on the streets Rebel fighters have plastered the city with fliers proclaiming their slogan   Death to America death to Israel a curse on the Jews and victory to Islam    a variation of a popular Iranian slogan often chanted by Shiite militants in Iraq and supporters of Lebanons Hezbollah     While the world has been focused on the fight against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq Yemen at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula has seen its own sudden seismic upheaval when Shiite rebels known as the Houthis overran Sanaa two weeks ago Now the Houthis who many believe are backed by Shiiteled Iran are poised to become Yemens version of the Shiite Hezbollah in Lebanon    top powerbrokers dominating the government and running a virtual statewithinastate Their takeover of the capital also threatens to bring a violent backlash from hardline Sunnis creating a sectarian battle that would boost alQaidas branch in Yemen which the United States has been battling for years in a drone campaign and in coordination with the Yemeni military The rallying cry of fighting against Shiite power could turn Yemen into a magnet for Sunni jihadis from around the region like Syria and Iraq Last week an alQaida suicide bomber rammed an explosivesladen car into a hospital used by the Houthis in Maarib province killing one person The group known as alQaida in the Arabian Peninsula vowed to fight the rebels and called on other Sunnis to support it You will see your bodies scattered and your heads flying alQaida said in a statement addressing the Houthis The USbacked president Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi is largely helpless struggling to form a new government to meet the Houthis demands Neighboring Saudi Arabia is worried over a potential proIranian outpost on its border In an interview with The Associated Press Jamal Benomar the UN special envoy who has been mediating among the government the Houthis and other factions warned that this takeover of Sanaa by the Hawthis will widely reverberate in Yemen and the region Yemen will now be seen as linked to other situations in the region with regional and international involvement he said The Houthis who call themselves Ansar Allah Arabic for Supporters of God are followers of the Zaidi faith a branch of Shia Islam that is almost exclusively found in Yemen and makes up about 30 percent of the countrys population Zaidi religious leaders ruled much of northern Yemen for centuries    and the Houthis backers of the Houthi family a clan that claims descent from the Prophet Muhammad have sought to revive Zaidi identity The rebels currently led by 33yearold AbdulMalik alHouthi fought a series of civil wars since the mid2000s from their stronghold of Saada north of Sanaa In 2011 they took complete control of Saada province But their advances this year have been startling They swept south defeating Sunni tribesmen loyal to the conservative Sunni Islah party and in July captured Amran province which borders the capital They then overran the capital itself on Sept 21 as the military largely collapsed The Houthis present themselves as seeking to achieve the goals of the 2011 Arab Spring uprising that led to the overthrow of longtime autocrat Ali Abdullah Saleh They reject a Gulfbrokered deal that led to Saleh stepping down and Hadi taking his place because it largely splits power between Salehs supporters and the Islah party which is the Muslim Brotherhoods branch in Yemen Instead they say they want a broader government that includes their movement and southern Yemenis who have long sought independence And they want implementation of a plan reached by political parties in January to give greater autonomy to Yemens regions We are not a group isolated from the rest of the country We are part of the social fabric Abu Ali alHakam the commander who led the Houthi assault on Sanaa told AP He spoke as he visited the captured headquarters of the armys 1st Armored Division an elite outfit with close links to the Islah party It had spearheaded army campaigns against the Houthis It is not just the Houthis who are controlling Sanaa now its Yemenis from everywhere said the diminutive alHakam after receiving a heros welcome by his fighters The Houthis were quick to tap on the widespread grievances to show themselves as a feasible alternative I and my family feel safer now said Faraj alRaeeny a schoolteacher from mainly Zaidi Amran province The Houthis resolved many disputes and put right many injustices They strictly enforce order Still not all Zaidis back the rebels and the takeover is likely to only polarize a nation where the central government is chronically weak Much of the country is out of government control plagued by tribal divisions alQaida militant violence widespread corruption and deep poverty that breeds resentment or rebellion The scene is further complicated by political rivalries Hadis supporters have long accused Saleh loyalists who still hold key posts in the military security forces and government of undermining Hadi in a bid to return to power Saleh and his loyalists in the army are widely believed to have helped the Houthis by standing aside as the fighters swept into Sanaa Ali alImad a senior Houthi official denied there were any understandings struck with Salehs camp but he acknowledged in an interview with the AP that the two sides    bitter foes in six wars between 2004 and 2010    shared temporarily mutual interests Hadi appeared caught off guard After Amran was captured in late July Hadi met with politicians who warned him that the Houthis would move on Sanaa next He said he was convinced that the Hawthis will not come near Sanaa rights lawyer Baraa Shiban who attended the meeting told AP A new UNbrokered accord that was hurriedly signed on the day Sanaa fell to the Houthis calls for a new government for all armed factions to put down their arms and for the rebels to leave the capital But there is little sign that will happen This peace agreement must be implemented otherwise the prospect of the disintegration of Yemen as we know it will become real warned Benomar who negotiated the accord Many doubt the Houthis have the need or resources to grab more territory But they have virtual veto power over who becomes the next prime minister and over the makeup of the next government And they are locking in their forces position in the capital    emulating the model of Iranianbacked Hezbollah which in Lebanon is the de facto government in predominantly Shiite areas of southern Beirut and in the south and east of the country In Sanaa the Houthis have tightened their grip on the citys northern districts where Zaidis are dominant as well as the nearby international airport Tanks and armored vehicles looted from army bases have now been deployed in those areas After the fall of Sanaa Houthis staged a massive victory rally in the city flying Hezbollah flags and portraits of Irans late supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini It is very clear that Hezbollah is their model They will never give up control of the airport or the northern districts Mohammed Qahtan a senior Islah leader told the AP in a hotel apartment where he has lived since his Sanaa home was stormed by the rebels,2014-10-04T03:00-04:00,guns

in Tijuana for weapons violation You might know this story The Sergeant has posttraumatic stress disorder after service in Afghanistan He says he made a mistake crossing into Mexico unintentionally when he asked Mexican authorities for help they arrested him That was on March 31st he has been trying to get released from prison ever since Today there was a hearing on the issue in the House BEGIN

under Mexican law he would have the capacity should it be proved that he had PTSD I sent a report to the Attorney General that showed that 10 days before in San Diego at the Veterans hospital he was

Sergeant and I understand it was reported that he did concur that the Sergeant has posttraumatic stress disorder So if thats the case then they have to release him So we  we feel that maybe in a day

were able to move him from the Tijuana jail which was  which was absolutely the worst place you would want to be in jail to it Takati which is a better condition But nevertheless when you are suffering from PTSD and those around you know that you have that problem and youre compounding basically you are compounding the PTSD by not allowing the treatment then yes you are delaying CROSSTALK OREILLY But its  its even worse than that he is being held in solitary for his own protection I mean they dont have any  his mother was on a few days ago They dont have anything to do Its almost torture Its almost like the Mexican government is torturing the man for what Because he had had three guns in his car Because he was moving from Florida to California and he made a wrong turn Even if you dont believe that so what its a low level beef I mean give us a break And thats what gets me angry about Mexico and I think its got to change Now what you were saying is Williams  Montel Williams say look the Americans is not doing enough to get the guy out Do you believe that ROYCE Absolutely I believe that we raise this question with the  with the White House The request for the President to make a call to the President of Mexico that never happened And you know at the same time we had a situation where we traded five senior Taliban leaders who were all involved with al Qaeda who had cost American lives We traded them and now theyre going to within a few months be able to go back to Afghanistan or back to Pakistan This makes no sense in terms of the balance OREILLY How do you know  how do you know President Obama didnt call Nieto How do you know ROYCE Because I made the request to the Vice President that the President make the call and after the fact when the conversation occurred we heard that this had not come up So we do know  OREILLY Biden told you he didnt make the call ROYCE No The White House indicated to us OREILLY Did they give you a reason why the President wouldnt call him ROYCE No no reason why but I think it has to do with the priorities here And I think the priorities are backwards  CROSSTALK OREILLY What how long does a phone call take How long does that take ROYCE It doesnt take long to pick up the phone and make a call on an issue like this one OREILLY All right Im going have Ed Henry hes going to be here tomorrow and ask why they didnt do that if indeed they didnt Kerry the Secretary of State did he call Nieto What has he done ROYCE I do not know if the Secretary of State got involved personally in this or not OREILLY All right ROYCE I do know  I do know that I have talked to the ambassador the foreign minister the attorney general been down there in Mexico OREILLY But youve been doing much you should do All right Now Im going to ask Rosen who is going to be on tomorrow with Henry if Secretary of State Kerry called him or did anything So we will get to the bottom of that tomorrow Good work Congressman ROYCE Yes OREILLY Again we expect

Associated Press KANSAS CITY Mo  The raucous roar at Kauffman Stadium swelled with every batter in the second inning and then got louder the rest of the night As bouncers rolled by infielders and bloops dropped in front of outfielders it became clear this World Series was headed to a climactic Game 7   just like the one 29 years ago when the Kansas City Royals won their only title     Lorenzo Cain looped a tworun single    one of eight Royals to get hits in a sevenrun second inning    and Eric Hosmer chopped a tworun double over shortstop as the Royals battered the San Francisco Giants 100 Tuesday night to tie the Series at three games apiece Pitching with the initials of late St Louis outfielder Oscar Taveras on his cap 23yearold rookie Yordano Ventura allowed three hits over seven innings for his first Series win Guys stepped up in a big way tonight Cain said Jeremy Guthrie starts Wednesday night for Kansas City and Tim Hudson for San Francisco in a rematch of Game 3 won by Kansas City 32 Hudson 39 will become the oldest Game 7 starter in Series history Lurking is Madison Bumgarner ready to pitch in relief after suffocating the Royals on a total of one run in winning Games 1 and 5 Were confident the Royals Billy Butler said Jeremy every time out gives us a chance to win Kansas City can be comfortable in this bit of history Home teams have won nine straight Game 7s in the Series including the Royals 110 rout of St Louis in 1985 since Pittsburghs victory at Baltimore in 1979 And the Giants have lost all four of their World Series finales pushed to the limit This clubs so resilient Theyre so tough Theyll put this behind them San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy said Youve come back against the odds and you can do it again Teams with the homefield advantage have won 23 of the last 28 titles including five in a row This Series has followed the exact pattern of the only other allwild card matchup in 2002 when the Giants won the opener fell behind 21 took a 32 lead and lost the last two games at Anaheim Ventura escaped his only trouble in the third when he walked the bases loaded with one out and then got Buster Posey to ground a 97 mph fastball into a double play Ventura threw fastballs on 81 of 100 pitches reaching up to 100 mph and worked around five walks Royals manager Ned Yost was able to rest the hardthrowing back of his bullpen Kelvin Herrera and Wade Davis enter Game 7 with two days off and closer Greg Holland with three This keeps all our big guns fresh and ready to tomorrow Yost said In a Series marked by blowouts    the first in which five games were decided by five runs or more    Kansas City outhit the Giants 156 Tuesday All nine Royals had hits by the third inning matching the mark set by Arizona against the Yankees in Game 6 in 2001 Cain drove in three runs and was among six Royals with two hits each Mike Moustakas homered in the seventh against Hunter Strickland ending a 36inning homerless streak in the Series the longest since 1945 Peavys outing was the shortest for a Series starter since the Yankees David Wells got just three outs against the Marlins 11 years ago in Game 5 according to STATS Peavy was charged with five runs and six hits in 1 13 innings leaving with a career Series record of 02 with a 958 ERA in three starts His record at Kauffman Stadium is 17 with a 728 ERA San Francisco had scored 15 straight runs entering the night but the Royals bludgeoned Peavy and Yusmeiro Petit in a 32minute bottom of the second to take a 70 lead Singles by Alex Gordon and Salvador Perez put runners on the corners and Moustakas grounded a double over the firstbase bag past Brandon Belt and down the rightfield line for a 10 lead Peavy struck out Omar Infante and in the nights key play Alcides Escobar hit a bouncer to Belt With Peavy yelling Home Belt checked Perez at third and then tried to outrace Escobar to first base rather than throw to second baseman Joe Panik who already was at the base Escobar slid past Belts failed tag attempt and into first to reach on the infield hit and Nori Aoki chased Peavy after 42 pitches with a single to left Petit who had pitched 12 scoreless postseason innings coming in allowed Cains blooped single to shallow right and advanced the runners with a wild pitch Hosmer chopped a ball that hopped over shortstop Brandon Crawford for a double that made it 60 and scored on Butlers double for a 70 lead Cain added an RBI double off Jean Machi in the third and Escobars runscoring double in the fifth made it 90 HOME COOKING Home teams are 233 in Games 6 and 7 combined since 1982 The last eight home teams that won Game 6 to even the Series also went on to win Game 7 and no road team has lost Game 6 and rebounded to win the title since the 1975 Cincinnati Reds at Bostons Fenway Park MOMENT OF SILENCE There was a moment of silence before the game in honor of Taveras the 22yearold killed in an automobile accident Sunday in the Dominican Republic Ventura a fellow Dominican who knew him well wrote RIP OT 18 in silver marker on the left side of his cap UP NEXT Giants Hudson allowed three runs and four hits in 5 23 innings in Game 3 Royals Guthrie on Game 7 My memories of a Game 7 probably go back to Jack Morris 91 he said I was 12 years old so certainly could appreciate the effort that he gave and the magnitude of the game to be able to pitch

planned with the precision of a seasoned traveler and expert in deception from Sahras ticket for the March 11 MarseilleIstanbul flight to Noras secret Facebook account and overnight crash pad in Paris Sahra and Nora are among about 100 girls and young women from France who have left to join jihad in Syria up from just a handful 18 months ago when the trip was not even on Europes security radar officials say They come from all walks of life   first and secondgeneration immigrants from Muslim countries white French backgrounds even a Jewish girl according to a security official who spoke anonymously because rules forbid him to discuss open investigations These departures are less the whims of adolescents and more the highly organized conclusions of months of legwork by networks that specifically target young people in search of an identity according to families lawyers and security officials These mostly online networks recruit girls to serve as wives babysitters and housekeepers for jihadis with the aim of planting multigenerational roots for an Islamic caliphate Girls are also coming from elsewhere in Europe including between 20 and 50 from Britain However the recruitment networks are particularly developed in France which has long had a troubled relationship with its Muslim community the largest in Europe Distraught families plead that their girls are kidnap victims but a proposed French law would treat them as terrorists liable to arrest upon return Sahras family has talked to her three times since she left but her mother Severine thinks her communication is scripted by jihadis possibly from the Islamic State group They are being held against their will says Severine a French woman of European descent They are over there Theyre forced to say things The Ali Mehenni family lives in a redtiled middleclass home in LezignanCorbieres a small town in the south of France Sahra who turns 18 on Saturday swooned over her baby brother and shared a room with her younger sister But family relations turned testy when she demanded to wear the full Islamic veil dropped out of school for six months and closed herself in her room with a computer Now she was in a new school And she seemed to be maturing    she asked her mother to help her get a passport because she wanted her paperwork as an adult in order On the morning of March 11 Sahra casually told her father she was taking extra clothing to school to teach her friends to wear the veil Kamel stifled his anxiety and drove her to the train station He planned to meet her there just before dinner as he did every night At lunchtime she called her mother Im eating with friends she said Surveillance video showed at that moment Sahra was at the airport in Marseille preparing to board an Istanbulbound flight She made one more phone call that day from the plane to a Turkish number her mother said By nightfall she had not returned Her worried parents went to police They noticed the missing passport the next day Everything was calculated They did everything so that she could plan to the smallest detail Severine says I never heard her talk about Syria jihad It was as though the sky fell on us Sahra told her brother in a brief call from Syria that she had married to a 25yearold Tunisian she had just met and her Algerianborn father had no say because he wasnt a real Muslim Her family has spoken to her twice since then always guardedly and communicated a bit on Facebook But her parents no longer know if shes the one posting the messages Sahra told her brother shes doing the same things in Syria that she did at home    housework taking care of children She says she doesnt plan to return to France and wants her mother to accept her religion her choice her new husband Noras family knows less about her quiet path out of France but considerably more about the network that arranged her oneway trip to Syria Nora grew up the third of six children in the ElBahty family the daughter of Moroccan immigrants in the tourist city of Avignon Her parents are practicing Muslims but the family does not consider itself strictly religous She was recruited on Facebook Her family does not know exactly how but propaganda videos making the rounds play to the ideals and fantasies of teenage girls showing veiled women firing machine guns and Syrian children killed in warfare The Frenchlanguage videos also refer repeatedly to Frances decision to restrict use of veils and headscarves a sore point among many Muslims Nora was 15 when she departed for school on Jan 23 and never came back The next day Foad her older brother learned that she had been veiling herself on her way to school that she had a second phone number that she had a second Facebook account targeted by recruiters As soon as I saw this second Facebook account I said Shes gone to Syria Foad says The family found out through the judicial investigation about the blur of travel that took her there First she rode on a highspeed train to Paris Then she flew to Istanbul and a Turkish border town on a ticket booked by a French travel agency no questions asked A young mother paid for everything gave her a place to stay overnight in Paris and promised to travel with her the next day according to police documents She never did Noras destination was ultimately a foreigners brigade for the Nusra Front an alQaida branch in Syria Foad says The idea apparently was to marry her off But she objected and one of the emirs intervened on her behalf For now at least she remains single babysitting children of jihadis She has said she wants to come home    and Foad traveled to Syria but was not allowed to leave with her As soon as they manage to snare a girl they do everything they can to keep her Foad says Girls arent there for combat just for marriage and children A reproduction machine Two people have been charged in Noras case including the young mother Other jihadi networks targeting girls have since been broken up including one where investigators found a 13yearold girl being prepared to go to Syria according to a French security official It is not at random that these girls are leaving

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2014/10/31/top-10-movie-cars-in-costume-696440827/,The Joker Captain America Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vader all have something in common They are iconic movie characters whose costumes are frequently seen walking the sidewalks on Halloween Unless you have the correct year make and model it can be fairly difficult to dress up your vehicle as a movie character but cars are just as prominent in film as the actors themselves and these 10 iconic movie cars in costume fit the bill     1964 Lincoln Continental In the 1978 National Lampoons film Animal House the Deathmobile began as a beautiful Lincoln Continental but near the end of the movie the car was cleverly disguised as parade float by the Deltas a troublemaking fraternity with low academic standing The Deltas Deathmobile sabotages the homecoming parade in an attempt to get even with Dean Vernon Wormer after he put the entire Delta fraternity on probation Hagerty 1984 Ford Econoline Harry Dunne Lloyds friend and roommate is in the pet grooming business and recently spent his life savings converting his 1984 Ford Econoline van into a sheepdog Lloyd calls it the shaggin wagon but we doubt theres much of that going on Lloyd a simpleminded limousine driver drops off Mary Swanson the woman of his dreams at the airport Mary leaves a briefcase behind as ransom money for her husbands return but an unwitting Lloyd takes the briefcase Harry and Lloyd both lose their jobs due to entirely preventable situations so they decide to take the shaggin wagon on a road trip to hunt down Mary and reunite her with the briefcase Hagerty 1959 Cadillac Miller Meteor Ambulance In the iconic 1984 film Ghostbusters Ecto1 is as much of a character as the actors themselves except the actors only wish they could age as well as a Cadillac Bill Murray Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis play three eccentric parapsychologists who start a ghostcatching business with the Cadillac serving as the company car The 1959 Miller Meteor is a rare car with only approximately 25 produced From this number two were transformed into Ecto1 for the film and additional replica cars were built by Universal Studios for touring theme park use and exhibition Hagerty 1966 Chrysler Imperial It all began in 1936 as a popular series of radio dramas then from 19661967 it was aired as a TV series and in 2011 as a movie starring Seth Rogen and Cameron Diaz In the 2011 film Britt a 28yearold slacker and Kato a hired mechanic aspire to become crimefighters who pose as criminals For this purpose Kato designs a car that is prepared for the job the Black Beauty With machine guns rocket launchers a flame thrower retractable spikes and reinforced steel armor the Green Hornets 1966 Chrysler Imperial was a beauty indeed It was one aggressive machine that just so happened to sound great too thanks to a powerful supercharged 45liter V8 engine The Duck Car We are all familiar with the different versions of the Batmobile that appeared onscreen throughout the Batman franchise but there is just something about a penguin riding in a gigantic yellow amphibious duck that deserves some attention Theres an obvious connection between the vehicle and its owner and the pair look quite ridiculous traveling through Gotham Citys narrow water channels If you were to watch a scene with the duck car without any knowledge of the Batman series youd surely think it was an idea that came fresh out of the loonybin Hagerty The Magical Car This classic 1968 musical film takes place in the 1910s and the story opens with a jumble of European Grand Prix races in which one car wins every race before its career comes to an end after swerving crashing and catching fire to avoid a girl rescuing a dog Caractacus Potts an eccentric inventor aims to purchase the totaled vehicle and rebuild it as one of his whimsical inventions later to be named Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in honor of the sound the engine makes The cars innovations include floatation devices that transform it into a power boat along with wings and propellers for flight Six vehicles were produced for the movie and five were used as props in various scenes Only one was a fully functioning car registered for road use in the United Kingdom Hagerty 1973 Ford XB Falcon GT351 This 1979 movie takes place in an oppressive future version of Australia where energy shortages run rampant and law and order dips into borderline chaos A motorcycle gang causes bedlam by vandalizing property stealing fuel and terrorizing townspeople After his son is killed as a result of the gangs nonsense an enraged Mad Max takes his black Pursuit Special the Ford XB Falcon to get even With a Weiand 671 supercharger bulging through the hood and a 351 Cleveland engine paired with a 4speed manual transmission nothing is going to stop Mad Max In a later movie the interior is stripped and two large spare gas tanks are added to the back giving the car a stressed and rugged postwar look 1966 Coffin Car The Munster movies began in 1966 when the Munster family heads to England to claim Munster Hall after a relatives passing Of course you cant have a Munster family without the classic Coffin Car named Drag U La  one of grandpa Munsters mad creations The vehicle was built from a real fiberglass coffin and featured a 350hp Ford Mustang V8 engine mated to a fourspeed manual transmission Two fourbarrel carburetors were mounted on a Mickey Thompson RamThrust manifold The Firestone racing slicks mounted on the back with custom wheels meant business and the tombstone grille organ pipe exhaust and spider headlights were to die for 1976 AMC Pacer Its the only AMC pacer to have giant french fries for wiper blades plus a fully loaded burger mounted to the front clip pickles for hubcaps and one monster of a ketchup bottle sticking out of the back hatch Someone surely was hungry when designing this movie car and it fits its role perfectly in this 1997 American comedy film about two rivaling Burger joints 1981 DeLorean DMC12 If you thought you would get away without having to read another callout to the iconic 1981 DeLorean time machine think again The 1985 American comic sciencefiction film Back to the Future may be exactly what made these cars so well known but this car isnt a normal DeLorean The DMC12 sports car had the ability to time travel once it reached exactly 88 mph During a test run Marty McFly asks Doc the creator of the time machine why he used a Delorean Doc replied that not only did the stainless steel construction help with temporal displacement but the car needed style and a timeless style is exactly what the DeLorean has,2014-10-31T00:00-04:00,guns

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/10/30/lone-wolf-terror-attacks-were-sitting-ducks-and-americans-with-guns-are-last/, The recent spate of lone wolf terrorist attacks both here and in Canada seem to have come out of nowhere And its clear that they have left Americans and Canadians as sitting ducks Simply by using the Internet ISIS has encouraged lone wolf individuals These wolves have initiated attacks on their own with no planning or coordination with others and without leaving a trail of clues about their intentions Law enforcement authorities and our government are not well suited to defend against such individual terror strikes As Israel has learned about such attacks there are just too many targets to defend     So what can be done to protect public safety When police and the military cant be everywhere the last line of defense is having more citizens carry guns Just look at the alleged lone wolf attacks in the last few months A clear pattern seems to be developing from the beheading a month ago in Oklahoma to last weeks car attack in Quebec the shooting at the National War Memorialin Ottawa and the hatchet assault in New York City Jerusalem last week also experienced a similar Jihadist attack with a terrorist driving his car onto a crowded sidewalk The announcement Wednesday that the federal government is beefing up security at federal buildings misses the real problem as weve already seen in the last month there are an uncountable number of targets Publicly announcing beefed up security at federal building simply makes it more likely that other targets will be hit After the attack on Parliament Canada rushed to give more detention and surveillance power to security agencies Not only is such a move more costly but lone attackers may not send incriminating emails that alert law enforcement and that they can intercept In addition the approach ignores a crucial problem What should be done if security measures fail The attack in Ottawa illustrates the limits to preventive policies Michael ZehafBibeaus long criminal history including robbery violent threats and various drug offenses made it impossible for him to buy a gun legally yet he still got one He had also flown under the governments radar and avoided being on their highrisk watch list Screening people is hardly perfect In the US many politicians have pleaded for more spending on mental health to prevent mass public shootings After all about half of these killers have exhibited mental illness before their attacks though very few of even those with schizophrenia  many fewer than 1in100000  represent a danger to others Indeed its very common for mass killers to already be seeing psychiatrists who fail to identify them as threats to others including Elliot Rodger Santa Barbara Ivan Lopez the recent Fort Hood shooter Adam Lanza Sandy Hook elementary James Holmes Batman movie theater and SeungHui Cho Virginia Tech There is even an entire academic literature on psychiatrists inability to identify these attackers Other countries have learned some valuable lessons on terrorism Possibly the most important one is that terrorists determine the place and timing of their attack For decades Israel responded to terrorist attacks by putting more armed police and military on the streets Unfortunately a mass killer can either wait for officers to leave the scene or kill them first Israel found that no matter how much money they spent terrorists patiently waited until a good opportunity presented itself Almost 15 percent of Israels adult Jewish civilian population has been licensed to carry weapons With possible victims carrying concealed handguns the wouldbe lone wolf attacker doesnt know who is able to defend themselves and doesnt know whom to attack first Terrorists have to resort to less effective secretive routes of attack such as bombing Killers seek out places where victims are sitting ducks Elliot Rodger who shot to death three people in Santa Barbara this summer explained why he picked his target His 141page manifesto makes it clear that he feared someone with a gun would stop him before he could kill enough people A mass public shooter in Canada this summer Justin Bourque also understood this On his Facebook page Bourque posted comics poking fun at how gunfree zones One depicted a completely defenseless victim pleading with a man pointing a gun at him But wait  theres a GUN BAN in this city  you cant do this we passed a law The gunman is shown thinking to himself Great another one of these fruit loops Since at least 1950 virtually all the mass public shootings in the US and all the attacks in Europe have taken place where guns carried by civilians are banned Canada might at least start with letting police carry guns while offduty When they travel around town cops could provide a quick response to any attack These individuals are trained and they are trusted to carry a gun while they are on duty but somehow a minute after their shift ends they are no longer considered competent With almost 70000 they wont cover most targets but it would still be a start Those who have served in the military should also be considered In the US at least 12 million Americans have concealed handgun permits see charts here and here Indeed in September the Oklahoma terrorist attack was stopped from beheading a second victim because a concealed handgun permit holder Mark Vaughan was able to quickly shoot the terrorist However much more can be done In some states such as California virtually no permits are issued For instance in Los Angeles just a couple hundred permits have been issued to an adult population of almost 8 million Giving government security agencies more power may help but it isnt a panacea and it risks others losing their privacy When that fails letting people defend themselves would provide another line of defense against any attacks  John R Lott Jr is a columnist forFoxNewscom

dreamy and romantic movement seeking to end autocrat Ali Abdullah Salehs 33year rule and transform the poorest Arab nation into a democratic modern society Nearly four years later Yemen is in chaos Shiite rebels have overrun the capital Saleh is out of power but remains powerful with his loyalists infusing the political scene and the military AlQaidas branch in the country is carrying out deadly attacks in Sanaa Attempts at real reform are in disarray     The activists behind the initial uprising look back at what went wrong and many of them point to a series of errors   starting when the Muslim Brotherhoods branch in the country the Islah party moved in and dominated the protest movement That turned the revolt into a power struggle between Saleh and the powerful conservative Islamists Now the Shiite Houthi rebels who swept into Sanaa last month say they did so to break Islahs hold The revolution was taken in a different direction and used by Islah to negotiate with Saleh at the expense of its basic aspirations said Majed alMadhaji an activist involved early in the uprising and now a political analyst There was an opportunity to correct Yemens political discourse and bring about its longterm recovery but it was taken away And look where we are now It is a theme heard in many of the countries that saw prodemocracy uprisings against autocrats in 2011 In most Islamists joined the revolts led by activists they had little common cause with Because of their stronger organization they came to dominate the movements and emerged as the strongest players after the autocrats fall    only to prompt backlashes that threw the countries into greater turmoil Egypts 2011 uprising for example was engineered and led by secular and liberal youth groups Islamists led by the Muslim Brotherhood then joined and after the fall of Hosni Mubarak used their vast resources and organizational skills to win the countrys first democratic parliamentary and presidential elections But after only a year in office President Mohammed Morsi was met by massive protests by Egyptians who accused his Brotherhood of trying to monopolize power Thenmilitary chief AbdelFattah elSissi removed Morsi but now his critics fear he is leading the country into even worse autocracy Many activists in the original antiMubarak revolt grumble that if the Islamists had not sought to dominate things would have turned out differently In Libya what began as protests in a 2011 revolt devolved into an 8month civil war that finally led to Moammar Gadhafis ouster and death but left the country in chaos with armed militias running rampant Many of those militias are Islamic extremist groups Meanwhile the Brotherhood and other Islamists sought to dominate the previous parliament and after losing recent elections they have tried to cling to power setting up an alternative government Back in Yemen in 2011 the innocent days of the uprising under the youth activists lasted barely a month before Islah and its ally Gen Ali Mohsen alAhmar commander of an elite armored division with longtime links to armed Islamic extremists joined The money of the Islamists and the might of the soldiers quickly overwhelmed the original activists The number of protesters grew the tents became bigger an elaborate distribution network for food water and money was set in motion and armed soldiers guarded the encampment Soon after the peaceful uprising became a footnote in street warfare between Salehs loyalists and alAhmars mutinying soldiers with battles by rockets mortars and machineguns in Sanaa The uprising ended in late 2011 with the backroom dealing typical of Salehs rule An accord mediated by Gulf nations and sponsored by Saudi Arabia and the United States forced Saleh to step down but guaranteed him immunity from prosecution His ruling party was given half the seats in a new Cabinet shared with the Islah party and led by Salehs former vice president Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi The deal also allowed members of his immediate family to retain their key positions in the military and security forces effectively perpetuating the hold of Yemens traditional powers    Saleh Islah and its allied militant militias powerful tribal chiefs and the army The young revolutionaries went home with genuine change still a dream not a reality Yemens current problems are rooted in the lack of appetite for an inclusive and national discourse by the forces that emerged from 2011 revolution like Islah said prominent analyst Mansour Hayel Politics has taken a back seat and armed militias have replaced it he said We are looking at a future of bloody chaos Since then Saleh remaining in Sanaa played the role of a spoiler using his loyalists to undermine Hadi and the transition process The power of Salehs loyalists was matched only by that of Islah which went on grabbing more and more key positions in the government civil service and state institutions while continuing to build its armed militias Meanwhile a key faction    the Shiite Houthi rebels    were marginalized not given a single post in Hadis Cabinet The rebel force had battled Salehs government six times in its strongholds north of the country since the mid2000s Since 2011 it has been fighting mainly with its top rivals    the conservative Sunnis of Islahs militias and allied tribesmen Even as they fought the Houthis and Islah were sitting at the same table along with other factions in a national dialogue led by Hadi intended to map out the future of the country The Houthis were particularly active in the dialogue pressing proposals on establishing a secular system The Houthis sat on the same table in a fivestar hotel discussing Yemens future with Islah as their supporters fought each other said Sarah Jamal a prominent activist and an icon of the 2011 uprising The dialogue often appeared oblivious to what was going around in the country things that were changing conditions on the ground Finally after a year of work the dialogue announced its plan marketed in a nationwide campaign of TV ads and street billboards as a roadmap to Yemens future and prosperity with political inclusion and socioeconomic equality high on the list The Houthis say their Sept 21 takeover of Sanaa is intended to rescue that plan which they say Islah does not intend to implement Hadi as well was slow in carrying out parts of the deal Houthi fighters defeated Islah fighters in weeks of fighting taking over much of the north of the country before sweeping into the capital Now the Shiite rebels have emerged as powerbrokers forcing Hadis nominee for a new prime minister to withdraw this past week But Jamal and other activists fear that the Houthi takeover is only the start of further violence between the rebels and Islah The Houthis defeat of Islah and its militias does not mean the end of Islah there is a huge popular base loyal to the party that is awaiting the order to fight back she

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/10/28/5-ways-to-deal-with-end-daylight-saving-time/,"REUTERSEduardo Munoz If youve been starting your day in neartotal darkness each morning relief is in sight November 2 marks the end of daylight saving time in most of the country and the day when your clocks fall back an hour That means youll get a bonus hour of light in the morning but lose an hour in the afternoon Although the prospect of leaving work when its dark out may be depressing sleep specialist and clinical psychologist Michael Breus reminds us to count our blessings     Believe it or not people have an easier time adjusting to this time change than to the one in March Breus said Thats because we gain an hour of sleep in the fall but end up losing an hour when we spring ahead Here how to make the transition to standard time as seamless as possible plus some silver linings to the time change Dont change your routine on November 1
The night before the time change just go to bed when you usually do Breus advised Most people are already sleep deprived so in all likelihood you could use the extra hour of sleep youll get he said Think of it as your own little hourlong staycation RELATED 10 Weird Causes of Winter Depression Use it as a sleep hygiene checkup
You can use the time change to diagnose your sleep habits Before bedtime on November 1 set your clock back an hour cell phones will be updated automatically at 2am and keep your alarm set for your regular wake up time If you find yourself sleeping for the entire extra hour in the morning thats a sign youre sleep deprived Breus said If on the other hand you wake up before your alarm goes off thats your body telling you that youre getting enough sleep The fall time change is a onceayear opportunity to calibrate your ideal bedtime RELATED 11 Surprising Health Benefits of Sleep After the time change maximize your sun exposure
Even after the fall back its not uncommon to feel out of sorts the first few days of November It doesnt help that the sun will start setting close to 5 pm So what should you do While your afternoon mood might take a hit because of the looming darkness Breus advised taking advantage of the extra sunlight in the morning which can give you a mood boost to start the day If you tend to work out in the evenings switch your routine to the morning At the very least make an effort get outside during your lunch break if only just to take a walk around the block and maybe boost your indoor light
If youre still feeling draggy in the afternoon after a few days consider investing in a light therapy box which can counteract your brains inclination to start producing melatonin when the sun goes down Just be sure to look for one that provides alertnesspromoting blue light Blue light mimics sunlight and tells the brain to stop producing melatonin the chemical that starts your brains sleep engine Breus explained If you need a little burst to get over that 4 pm hump at work click on the light and let it shine for no more than 20 minutes That amount should be enough to make you feel more alert for a couple hours Breus explained If you want to get to bed at a reasonable hour be sure not to use the light after 7pm any later than that can interfere with your sleep Breus likes the Philips goLITE BLU 137 amazoncom but Amazon has a range of light therapy box styles and sizes Dont want to buy another gadget Definity Digital by LightingScience makes alertnesspromoting bulbs you can install in most household fixtures 70 amazoncom RELATED 7 Signs of Seasonal Affective Disorder And if you have kids
The downside to falling back is that small children already allergic to spending extra time in bed may actually start waking up an hour earlier I foresee this gloomy prospect in my own household where my 5yearold and 2yearold already attuned to a 6 am wake up will go right on waking up at the same time which will actually be 5 am come November 2 Heres how to get them to get with the program Starting about a week or so before the time change every two days put your kids to bed 15 minutes later in a stairstepping pattern Breus said In other words on October 25 put your kids to bed 15 minutes later Then again on October 27 and October 29 so that by October 31 theyre going to bed an hour later Added bonus an extra hour of candyfueled capering on Halloween When November 2 arrives theyll be acclimated to going to bed an hour later andin theory at leastwaking up an hour later that morning which will wash out when the clocks reset And if the bedtime rollback plan doesnt take Breus suggested making the morning of November 2 a special occasion The night before lay out books or games the kids can play with quietly when they wake up Set an alarm in their rooms for when youll wake up and tell them its bonus playtime and they dont have to bother mom and dad If the thought of your kids quietly reading and biding their time until the sun comes up sounds preposterous dont hesitate to bring out the big guns Even setting your kids up to watch a video in the early morning is okay in this instance said Breus In all likelihood the parents could use that extra hour of sleep so do whatever it takes to take advantage of it This article originally appeared on Healthcom",2014-10-28T05:00-04:00,guns

Fox,http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2014/10/23/food-companies-spending-millions-to-fight-label-requirements-in-colorado/,DENVER  Farms and fields dominate Colorado ads opposing a ballot measure to require labels on some foods that have been genetically modified with farmers telling voters the labels will damage their businesses But farmers and agriculture groups are just bit players in the 11 million campaign to defeat Proposition 105 The real money is coming from biotechnology giant Monsanto Co which has given more than 47 million and food giants like Pepsico and CocaCola which sent a combined 19 million to fighting the proposal Hormel Foods Kraft Foods Kellogg Co and The Hershey Co are also outspending farm groups to fight the proposal Food companies are pouring big money into fighting a similar ballot measure in Oregon too Colorado and Oregon are battlegrounds in a national war over genetically modified organisms or organisms that have been altered at the molecular or cellular level Socalled GMOs now make up almost the entirety of many staple crops such as corn and soybeans which are used in many items on grocerystore shelves Were not saying GMOs are bad Were saying we want them to be labeled said Tammi DeVille Merrell campaign manager for Right To Know Colorado which has raised less than 500000 and has no TV or radio ads to promote its campaign Short on funds the campaign is relying on bigname endorsers to take their side Chipotle along with Ben  Jerrys ice cream company has backed GMO labeling Former Democratic presidential hopeful Dennis Kucinich has planned a visit to Colorado next week to talk up the measure Labeling opponents in Colorado feel confident theyll be able to defeat the proposal Theyve spent just about 3 million on television ads according to campaign finance data analyzed by the Center for Public Integrity The ads call the labeling measure misleading because it doesnt cover many foods in the grocery store including eggs meat dairy and beer Those foods arent currently genetically modified though animals are often raised on feed that has been modified Labels also wouldnt be required on foods and drinks sold for immediate consumption by grocery stores restaurants or delis Proponents said those foods are regulated in different code sections making them impossible to include in a single ballot question But opponents say the differences would confuse shoppers Labels on food are very important to me They need to be very reliable and not leave people making assumptions said Mary Lee Chin a registered dietitian who volunteers for the opposition campaign Chin said GMOs can help the environment by producing foods that require less water or fewer pesticides Genetic engineering techniques theyre a more efficient way of growing foods said Chin who has worked as a consultant for Monsanto in the past but no longer works for the company Colorado and Oregon could become the first states to adopt mandatory GMO labels through public votes Washington and California rejected GMO ballot proposals in recent years Vermont lawmakers have approved GMO label requirements but the matter is still being fought in the courts Publicly available polling is limited on GMO label requirements Colorado State University looked at the question 14 years ago and found mixed results In that 2000 survey shoppers along the Front Range were asked about genetically modified potatoes A whopping 78 percent supported mandatory labeling   but respondents were not willing to pay a premium for such labeling Farming groups opposed to mandatory labeling argue it would make food more expensive though the sides disagree on how much Proponents are hoping Colorado is now ready to make GMO labels mandatory This issue is really resonating with people They want to know whats in their food said Kelly Erb spokeswoman for Right To Know Colorado The GMO question is one of four statewide ballot measures Coloradans will decide next month Dozens more ballot questions are pending in other states on everything from guns to marijuana to gambling More than 1 billion dollars will likely be spent on campaigns this year for ballot measures according to the Center for Public Integrity Thats more than the Republican and Democratic parties have raised collectively this cycle CPI looked at television ad spending on all ballot measures nationwide Other highlights from Colorado    A measure to allow casino gambling at a horse racetrack in suburban Denver Amendment 68 has attracted more TV spending than any ballot question outside California Supporters have spent about 64 million on 5582 television ads Opponents have spent about 57 million on 6390 ads    A measure to add unborn human beings to Colorado criminal code is as lopsided as the GMO measure Opponents are the only ones on TV Abortionrights groups that fear the measure could harm reproductive rights and had spent about 477000 on television ads through Oct 20

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/24/narrow-path-to-victory-dems-fight-to-keep-control-senate-in-final-week/, Amid all the predictions of a Republicanled stomping on Election Day Democrats and the outside groups supporting them still see a path to victory and are planning a blitz in key states that could act as a firewall against a GOP Senate takeover As the campaign enters its final full week Democrats also are trying to keep Republican attacks at bay by focusing on local issues  as opposed to President Obama  and are training resources on getting out the vote including with early voting     Republicans continue to voice confidence about their chances and political prognosticators largely predict the GOP will control Congress next year But Democrats are staying focused  Justin Barasky at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee pointed to key races where despite what Republicans are saying about Obama being an albatross the numbers appear to be improving for the Democrats That includes Democrat Michelle Nunn in her race against Republican David Perdue for the open Senate seat in Georgia Recent polls have shown her up by a few points though the race still is very close  and the winner needs over 50 percent to avoid a runoff Another open question is Kentucky where Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes has endured a rough few weeks in her race against Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell But the DSCC after letting its previous ad buy expire now is going back on air in the state in support of Grimes with a 650000 purchase The race is closing Barasky said I think Kentucky voters are sick of Mitch McConnell He added that in every state the message will be different but it invariably will concentrate on Democrats fighting for the middle class while painting their opponents as subservient to outside interests McConnells campaign has pushed back hard on the contention that Grimes may be gaining releasing its own numbers showing the incumbent well ahead Grimes lately had been tripped up on the campaign trial after refusing to say if she voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012 reflecting the mine field that Democrats everywhere are facing over their ties to the president The Obama factor alone is one of the biggest challenges for many Democrats in battleground states Bill Scher senior writer for the progressive Campaign for Americas Future acknowledged they are not asking him to stand with them on the stage together However he noted even though there is dissonance going on personally with Obama its not like they are abandoning what they believe This is nothing new at the end of President George W Bushs term he was so much of a drag on GOP tickets that he was barely mentioned during the Republican National Convention in 2008 The Obama factor though is used as a bludgeon in almost every competitive Senate race this year by Republicans Sen Mark Begich DAlaska who is in a tossup race with Republican Dan Sullivan told the Washington Examiner the presidents not relevant to his race Hes gone in two years he said When asked in a recent television interview if he is a strong leader endangered North Carolina Democratic Sen Kay Hagan couldnt seem to think of any issues where the president has shined Hes got a lot on his plate she said before stumbling through the rest of her response Barasky insists these races will be won on local issues and not on any national narrative driven by the GOP To advance their message in critical states some candidates have brought in the big guns  not Obama but figures like Bill and Hillary Clinton  who have been barnstorming across the country stumping and fundraising on Democrats behalf In just the last week this included stops for Grimes Sen Al Franken in Minnesota Sen Mark Udall in Colorado Sen Mark Pryor in Arkansas and a number of gubernatorial candidates Mrs Clinton is scheduled to make appearances this weekend for Hagan and Sen Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire Shaheen though is seeing Republican Scott Brown make significant gains in the polls Hillary Clinton recently raised 35 million in California for the campaign committees of House and Senate Democrats including 21 million at a Hollywood event with Democratic megadonors Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg In close races like Arkansas Bill Clinton is as good a trump card as they can play to inoculate Mark Pryor from Obama there points out political strategist Dan Gerstein Clinton makes the race more about Arkansas Most importantly appearances by Alisters can help not so much draw undecided voters to the Democratic candidate but mobilize the troops Gerstein said Getting out the vote in a typically sluggish midterm election is critical Traditional constituencies like black and women voters are being targeted with television and radio ads to make sure they turn out Particularly with women Democrats are feeling the heat as recent polling shows Republicans closing the gender gap in Colorado New Hampshire and Iowa despite attempts to rally women on issues relating to contraception and abortion rights With black voters The New York Times reported that Obama had also launched an undertheradar campaign including video ads and outreach to reporters to ensure that millions of black voters go to the polls in states where they will make a big difference specifically Georgia and North Carolina On Fox News Sunday the heads of the two parties each voiced confidence about their chances Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the GOP absolutely will take the Senate We feel really good about our chances of taking the Senate And its partly because number one the president has taken the country in the wrong direction These lieutenants out there across the country have followed the president off the plank he said His Democratic counterpart Debbie Wasserman Schultz claimed Democrats would hold their ground and not give the GOP the six seats it needs to take control The one question that voters are going to ask themselves  is who has my back And on issue after issue Democrats have stood up for jobs for the economy for investing in education and health care those are the issues that voters are talking about she said She cited Georgia and also South Dakota and Kansas  where independent candidates have caused problems for the GOP nominees  as battlegrounds in the final stretch But even Democrats acknowledge Republicans appear to have the enthusiasm edge  something that recent polling underscores The side with the more energy is going to have an advantage and at this rate in the states that are in play the Republicans have the advantage because there is so much negative energy toward the president Gerstein said So the Democrats are doing whatever they can do to get their base out plus whatever they can do to prevent Democraticleaning voters and independents from voting Republican,2014-10-24T13:39-04:00,guns

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/31/batch-bizarre-political-ads-released-to-sway-last-minute-voters/, WASHINGTON  Condom shortages A drowning child Drugaddled monkeys These are just a few of the topics tackled in the final batch of campaign ads being aired ahead of next weeks elections as political campaigns and allied groups push the envelope in pursuit of undecided voters and perhaps those who hadnt been paying attention until now     The new ads run the gamut from the creative and charmingly offbeat to the disturbing to the simply bizarreIn the final blitz before Election Day many are going for raw shock value Take Neel Kashkaris Betrayal spot  The largely selffinanced GOP candidate who is challenging California Gov Jerry Brown released a 30second ad earlier this month showing a young boy drowning in a pool As the boy flails a message on the screen reads When kids in failing schools begged Jerry Brown for rescue HE BETRAYED THEM The ad then shows Kashkari saving the boy and saying When Im governor Ill fight for kids not against them The piece was panned by some political analysts For a political ad its running on the outer edge of acceptable Barbara OConnor director emeritus of the nonpartisan Institute for the Study of Politics and Media at California State University told a Sacramento television station But Kashkari says he wanted the most dramatic image he could find adding I dont think the ad goes far enough The Republican continues to trail far behind Brown An Oct 22 Public Policy Institute of California poll shows Kashkari trailing Brown by 16 percentage points 5236 percent One new ad raising eyebrows is from NARAL a leftleaning prochoice organization that is weighing in on Colorados tight Senate race between Democratic incumbent Sen Mark Udall and Republican challenger Rep Cory Gardner The ad suggests a vote for Gardner would lead to a birth control ban and a national run on condoms It starts with a female narrator saying Guys guys guys guys The video shows a mans hand groping for a condom wrapper on a nightstand If Cory Gardner gets his way you better stock up on condoms the narrator says The commercial cuts to a couple in bed with the male frustrated hes apparently run out of contraceptives The group is referring to a bill Gardner backed that reportedly could ban some types of birth control but a recent fact check notes Gardner does not actually want to ban birth control  The ad promoted as edgy by NARAL hasnt been a home run with all voters  Ummmmmm okay Wait  what Lisa Carter a voter in Colorado told FoxNewscom after she watched the spot adding that it did little to sway her voteIts just weird and creepy you know Then theres an ad by the National Republican Congressional Committee against Georgia Rep John Barrow It features a woman sitting on a stool with a monkey on her shoulder in an attempt to make a point about outrageous government spending  820000 of our tax dollars were spent studying how monkeys respond to unfairness and how they act while on cocaine Think about that the narrator says This election cycle guns were used in several ads and showcased candidates from both parties bragging about their shooting skills in open fields In Kentuckys competitive Senate race between incumbent Republican Sen Mitch McConnell and Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes both sides relied heavily on their love of guns to get their message across In a Grimes ad from last month shes shown skeet shooting saying shes not Barack Obama She also offers to show McConnell how to hold a gun McConnell though went up this week with a whimsical ad showing him getting advice on how to make  commercials One scene shows his ad gurus telling him We see you between two trucks  before showing McConnells face glued onto the famous JeanClaude Van Damme ad where the actor is seen doing a split between two big rigs  But perhaps one of the strangest political ads airing this election year involves the tagteam duo of Nevada congressional GOP candidate Kamau Bakari and outspoken rancher Cliven Bundy  Dressed as cowboys and standing next to a horse Bakari and Bundy awkwardly attempt to poke fun at political correctness and racism in the web video They also challenge Attorney General Eric Holder to debate the issue of race with them Bakari is running in the 1st Congressional District race against Democratic incumbent Rep Dina Titus and GOP candidate Annette Teijeiro Bundy speaks in the ad saying he ought to be able to say whatever he wants without being labeled a racist The Nevada rancher had been criticized earlier this year for suggesting black people were better off as slaves As of Thursday the BakariBundy ad had more than 60000 hits on YouTube While some lastminute ads are seen as a Hail Mary others are meant to motivate a constituency in tight races JJ Balaban a partner at The Campaign Group told FoxNewscom Balaban who has helped create television and radio ads for campaigns in 34 states and 54 congressional districts says it all comes down to how competitive a race is and where the ads run For example some candidates in smaller races dont have a ton of cash and so they rely on cheap web videos that have an amateurish feel and tend to be more outlandish than those paid for and aired on traditional media outlets What youll see is that web videos get a lot of attention but its a mistake to treat them with the same weight as paid TV ads Balaban said adding that most web videos are like a flash in the pan The crazier they are though the more likely a reporter is going to spot it These ads succeed when reporters write about them and you arent going to write about them if they arent off the wall or wacky he said Campaigns are still running plenty of paid TV ads According to the Center for Public Integrity a review of preliminary data shows that 908000 television ads for Senate races will have aired through Monday With a weeks worth of advertising yet to be tallied to say nothing of the deluge of messaging that would flood anticipated Senate runoff contests in Georgia and Louisiana the millionad mark will be eclipsed soon CPI states on its

scuffle with local residents in Mong Kok Hong Kong Friction between prodemocracy protesters and opponents of their weeklong occupation of major Hong Kong streets persisted Saturday as police denied they had any connection to criminal gangs suspected of inciting attacks on largely peaceful demonstrators AP PhotoWally Santana HONG KONG  In an apparent concession to authorities warning prodemocracy protesters to clear Hong Kongs streets by the beginning of the work week students occupying the area outside city government headquarters agreed Sunday to remove some barricades that have blocked the buildings entrance during the weeklong demonstrations But it was not immediately clear how significant the move was and how much it would defuse the standoff with many protesters vowing to stay in the area The partial withdrawal also appeared to be part of a strategy to regroup in another part of town     Television footage from the scene showed a protest representative shaking hands with a police officer and the two sides removing some barricades together About 300 demonstrators remained standing peacefully outside the governments main building and did not appear to have intentions to move Across the harbor in Hong Kongs Mong Kok district protesters appeared divided about whether to stay put or decamp to the citys Admiralty area the main protest site The atmosphere in Mong Kok was relatively relaxed as people began to clear out though many said they were headed home and not to another protest area I dont know what the next step is but I will not retreat The people you see here will not retreat said Burnett Tung an 18yearold student who has served as a volunteer at a food supply station outside government headquarters all week The leaders of the movement are the citizens Were leading the movement not them said Roy Wong 21 referring to some protest leaders who called for a retreat from Mong Kok Tens of thousands of people many of them students have poured into the streets of the semiautonomous city over the past week to peacefully protest Chinas restrictions on the firstever direct election for Hong Kongs top leader promised by Beijing for 2017 But with the standoff between the protesters and the government in its eighth day tempers were flaring and patience was waning among residents who oppose the occupation of the streets and the disruption it has brought Police using pepper spray clashed with protesters overnight after officials said they intended to have key streets open for schools and offices by Monday morning Large crowds of demonstrators scuffled with police in the bluecollar Mong Kok district a flash point that has seen violent clashes between prodemocracy student protesters and their antagonists throughout the weekend Police said they had to disperse the crowds with force because protesters had provoked officers with verbal abuse while the students accused police of failing to protect them from attacks by mobs intent on driving them away The students say police allied themselves with criminal gangs to clear them but the government has vehemently denied the accusation Hong Kongs leader Chief Executive Leung Chunying appeared on television Saturday evening to urge everyone to go home saying key roads paralyzed by protesters needed to return to normal by Monday The government and the police have the duty and determination to take all necessary actions to restore social order so the government and the 7 million people of Hong Kong can return to their normal work and life Leung said Police said they had arrested 30 people since the protests started Sept 28 and that 27 police officers had been injured while on duty in the protest areas To restore order we are determined and we are confident we have the capability to take any necessary action said police spokesman Steve Hui We have to make correct assessments then depending on the prevailing situation we will consider all necessary measures Asked to clarify the authorities demands for clearing areas near government offices Hui would say only that government workers needed to work There should not be any unreasonable unnecessary obstruction by any members of the public he said The atmosphere on the streets was tense Sunday amid fears police may use pepper spray and tear gas to disperse the protesters as they did last weekend The University of Hong Kong among others warned students to leave the streets I am making this appeal from my heart because I genuinely believe that if you stay there is a risk to your safety said Peter Mathieson the universitys president Please leave now You owe it to your loved ones to put your safety above all other considerations The protests are the strongest challenge to authorities in Hong Kong  and in Beijing  since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 Beijing has promised that the city can have universal suffrage by 2017 but it says a committee of mostly proBeijing figures must screen candidates for the top job The protesters also are demanding Leungs resignation but he has refused to step down The next steps are uncertain after student leaders called off planned talks with the government until officials respond to claims that police tolerated attacks by alleged mobsters The movement has largely been freeforming and many who take part are uncertain of what comes next The government said Sunday that it was happy to talk to the students and that it hoped protest leaders would cooperate and allow the reopening of the roads outside the governments headquarters I believe there will be lots of people who want to stop the police from clearing this place Jack Fung a 19yearold student said at the government headquarters Sunday morning But if the police use rubber bullets or real bullets there will be many people who will leave the place because it will be too dangerous Fung said he supported allowing civil servants to go back to work Monday but he believed protesters should block Leung from entering his office In Mong Kok the violence calmed later Sunday but rowdy crowds kept up loud and heated street arguments Many residents and businesspeople are fed up with the disruption saying they want to return to normal life as soon as possible Police officers carrying guns patrolled the area and at least one officer was seen carrying tear gas canisters This

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/27/georgia-senate-race-dead-heat/, ATLANTA  In a closingstretch push for allout victory Republican Senate candidate David Perdue brought in the big guns over the weekend Party powerhouses Sens Ted Cruz and Rand Paul rallied smalltown crowds to get behind the former CEO of Reebok and Dollar General and send him to Washington I can think of only a few businessmen that we have Paul told the crowd at a town square rally in McDonough just south of Atlanta And I think it would be great to have someone with some common sense  with some business sense to create jobs     Job creation is the centerpiece of Perdues message to Georgia voters As CEO of Dollar General Perdue led a massive expansion of the company creating 20000 jobs in the process The number one thing that we need to be talking about is whos going to go to the Senate and add value to the debate of how to get the economy going to get people back to work again right here in Georgia Perdue told Fox News The race to replace retiring Republican Sen Saxby Chambliss is surprisingly competitive  discomfortingly so for Republicans What should have been a sure thing is now neckandneck with Perdue locked in a dead heat against Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn Nunn is the daughter of former Sen Sam Nunn who served 24 years in the Senate at a time the deep South was deep blueShe is also the CEO on leave of absence for George HW Bushs Points of Light Foundation  putting a foot in both the Democratic and Republican camps In fact Nunn is running her campaign more like a Republicrat  a person who talks like a Republican but whose blood runs Democratic blue There are lots of things I agree with the president on and there are lots of things I disagree with the president on Nunn told the audience at a debate Sunday night Where does she disagree She believes the president should approve the Keystone pipeline thinks he has made irresponsible cuts to the military and thinks he needs to do more to work with Congress and tackle the debt But she agrees with him on key issues like an increase in the minimum wage  as well as the mother of all campaign issues ObamaCare Thats the ground Perdue is tilling in the closing days of the race as he makes the case that a vote for Nunn would be a rubber stamp for the presidents policies He has said that his issues  his policies are on the ballot this time in this Senate race Perdue told Fox News aboard his campaign motorhome And this week he said you need to elect Michelle Nunn in Georgia to continue his policies And I would argue those policies are failing  by any measure Perdue also is warning voters that should she win the first vote Michelle Nunn will cast will be to reinstate Harry Reid as majority leader But at Sundays debate she indicated her vote is not a lock Right now I would tell you that I think that there are a lot of reasons to say to Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell that we need to do something different she told the debate audience Similarly Perdue has refused to say if he will back Mitch McConnell for majority leader Perdue is running as an outsider and does not want to give the impression that should he get to Washington he will become the proverbial inside man Both campaigns are focused intensely on voter turnout Supporters of Nunn registered tens of thousands of minority voters before the Oct 6 deadline Perdues campaign is reaching out to a pool of 600000 socalled low propensity voters At a campaign stop in Canton Ga Sen Ted Cruz implored voters to not cast a ballot for the thirdparty candidate  Libertarian Amanda Swafford  and instead vote for Perdue I encourage you to maintain your passion for liberty Cruz told the crowd But this election a couple of votes a couple of percentage can determine whether we win this election or it goes to a runoff Georgia is one of two states this election cycle Louisiana is the other where if a candidate does not reach the 50 percent vote threshold the top two votegetters go headtohead in a runoff Because of military and absentee voter laws the Georgia runoff isnt until Jan 6 2015 If on election night the balance of power falls to the Georgia race the two parties are expected to wage a battle royal for control of the Senate Campaign spending could top 100 million And the race would redefine ugly For the moment both sides are playing for an outright win on election night Because runoffs in Georgia favor Republicans a showing of 50 percentplusone on Nov 4 may be Nunns only path to victory Though most political experts believe David Perdue would prevail in a oneonone matchup the candidate wants to leave nothing to chance Despite polls that suggest a runoff is increasingly likely Perdue would like to put the race to bed on election night  In January of 2014 he told Fox News I was in dead last place in a 7way primary We ended up winning the primary we ended up getting through a very tough runoff  you know were trying to win this thing November 4th   John Roberts joined Fox News Channel FNC in January 2011 as a senior national correspondent and is based in the Atlanta bureau,2014-10-27T12:54-04:00,guns

it from the Islamic State group while patrolling in the northern village AP NORMAN Okla  The exhausted Kurdish fighters leaned against a pair of antiquated green cannons on a hill overlooking this northern Iraqi village the ground around them littered with shrapnel from fierce battles with Islamic State militants One of them Moustafa Saleh tapped the cannon with his mudcaked boots Russianmade he said with a smirk My grandfather used the same one     Iraqi Kurdish fighters on the front lines of battle say they have yet to receive the heavy weapons and training pledged by the United States and nearly a dozen other countries to help them push back the Sunni militants USled airstrikes have forced the militants to retreat or go into hiding in towns and villages across northern Iraq paving the way for ground forces to retake territory seized by the militant group in its lightening advance since June across western and northern Iraq But without more sophisticated weaponry the Kurdish fighters known as peshmerga have had to rely on aging arms like the Sovietera cannons a centerpiece of the offensive Tuesday to retake Mahmoudiyah and the nearby strategic towns of Rabia and Zumar While some newly sent arms have stacked up in the Kurdish capital including a shipment from Germany this week Kurdish officials say they cant be distributed until the Kurdish fighters are trained The delay shows the difficulties on the ground as the US and its allies bomb the militants from the air Peshmerga were only trained before to save Kurdistan and to prevent terrorists from coming inside Kurdistan said Halgurd Hekmat spokesman for the Iraqi Kurdish force in Irbil the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region We plan to send the heavy weapons but only after making sure the soldiers know how to use them in battle and fix them when the weapons have a problem At a checkpoint outside Rabia in northwestern Iraq some two dozen peshmerga soldiers stood guard Wednesday to secure the town they had just retaken Only one wore a flak jacket We dont have them Special Forces commander Hakar Mohsen said One of many things we need A halfmile away the Rabia hospital remained an active battleground with Islamic State militants holed up inside sniping at the Kurdish soldiers At one point the Kurdish fighters fired off a round from one of their aging cannons to a chorus of cheers though it was unclear if it hit its target We could retake the hospital so easily if we had the right rockets said Mohsen Most of our injuries here were from roadside bombs which could have been limited if we had bomb detectors for example As he spoke several Kurdish units were fanning westward to try to reclaim the strategic town of Sinjar which would almost certainly secure the main road between Syria and Iraq used now by militants to ferry weapons and fighters between the two embattled countries The US and Western allies including Britain France Germany and the Netherlands have committed to arming the Kurds agreeing to send machine guns assault rifles and ammunition Hekmat said some units had received the ammunition since it requires no training However fighters at more than a halfdozen units interviewed by The Associated Press said they had yet to receive anything Retired Lt Gen Michael Barbero a former US commander in Iraq who just returned from a trip to Irbil said it was clear to him that the US is not delivering the weapons the Kurds need to fight the Islamic State group The short answer is no they are not getting the heavy weapons they need he said adding that the Kurds were in great need of American technology to counter roadside bombs They took a lot of casualties in the fight on the Syrian border Kurdish fighters on the front lines said they could not have retaken the towns in Iraqs northern Nineveh province were it not for the USled airstrikes We could not do this without the help of America said Captain Hoshyar Harki a peshmerga fighter based in Mahmoudiyah Meanwhile in neighboring Syria Kurdish fighters have been on the defensive as the Islamic State militants pressed a relentless assault on the strategic northern town of Kobani also known as Ayn Arab near the Turkish border Nine Kurdish fighters including three women captured in clashes in the border region were beheaded by the Sunni extremists according to the Britainbased Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Dozens of militants and Kurdish fighters were killed in the fighting it said Images posted on social media networks showed womens heads placed on a cement block said to be in the northern Syrian city of Jarablous which is held by the militants The photos could not be independently verified but corresponded to AP reporting of the event The creation of the peshmerga in the 1920s coincided with Kurdish independence movements following the collapse of the Ottoman and Qajar empires and for much of their history they have operated much like a rebel movement During the USled invasion of Iraq in 2003 the highly disciplined peshmerga swept down from the semiautonomous Kurdish region and established a strong presence in a belt of largely Kurdish towns and villages stretching south toward Baghdad The disintegration of Iraqi forces in the face of the Islamic State groups advance in June led the peshmerga to assume full control in areas they have long coveted further enhancing their autonomy from Baghdad and undermining US efforts to bring about a stable multiethnic Iraq They have fought well many analysts say considering their lack of training Peshmerga is fundamentally a militia said Richard Brennan an Iraq expert with RAND Corporation and former US Department of Defense policymaker who said that much of their arsenal to date includes AK47s and a few Sovietera weapons and vehicles But they are fighting for their homeland and they are motivated unlike what we saw with Iraqi security forces in Mosul when they fell apart upon the first sign of threat The Islamic State militants captured many of the weapons left behind by the Iraqi army including Kalashnikovs machine guns antiaircraft guns and mortars said an Iraqi intelligence official speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media The militant group is also in possession of about 35 Iraqi military tanks about 80 armored police vehicles and hundreds of Humvees They got so many weapons from the Iraqi military that theyre taking some to Syria now said Khalil Abdulrahman Zebari one of the Kurdish fighters in Mahmoudiyah As for the pershmergas aging weaponry Mohsen the Rabia commander joked We are so used to fixing old broken weapons that peshmerga fighters also have a good future as weapons

now in its fourth year AP PhotoDiaa HadidThe Associated Press DWEIR SHEIKH SAAD Syria  The posters announcing the deaths of Syrian soldiers are plastered on walls throughout the coastal province of Tartous forming impromptu murals of death that illustrate the price supporters of President Bashar Assad are paying to defend his rule The khakiclad men often pose with guns with Assads image often imposed above the slain soldier     For government supporters Assad is synonymous with Syria itself particularly in Tartous a scenic Mediterranean port that is majority Alawite an offshoot of Shiite Islam that is the faith of Assads family For Syrias Alawite minority there is no other way out but to back the president despite rumblings of dissent Rebels often indiscriminately target Alawites hardliners among the rebels consider them heretics and worse they are synonymous with Assads rule More soldiers have been killed from Tartous than any other region in Syria in the fighting to quell the armed rebellion seeking to topple Assad now in its fourth year This is the price we must pay for the country said Ramadan Haidar whose 23yearold son Mahmoud was killed fighting in northern Syria Because if the country doesnt regain its sovereignty then I have lost my son and my home Its unlikely that need for the sons of Tartous will ease with the government seemingly desperate for soldiers as the conflict grinds on Some 4000 soldiers from Tartous have been killed in the war according to a Syrian official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasnt authorized to speak to media The death toll forms some 10 percent of the estimated 40400 soldiers killed even though Tartous population is fewer than a million people   less than onetwentieth of Syrias prewar population of 23 million Alawites form some 13 percent of Syrias population concentrated in the coastal provinces and the central city of Homs They are not the only ones to die in the fighting Syrias army represents the sectarian makeup of the country it is largely Sunni Muslim fighting mostly Sunni Muslim rebels But Alawite troops are the most trusted by leadership School teacher Haidars son Mahmoud was killed two years ago in a suicide bombing The family home in the town of Dweir Sheikh Saad in Tartous province is now a memorial for the young man strung with photos of Mahmoud in his army uniform with his girlfriend with his two sisters Haidars wife Ibtisam 43 stashed away her sons belongings including red loveheart cushions his girlfriend gave him She wore a necklace with a pendant of Mahmouds face often clutching it as she described her pride in her son for joining the Syrian army He was sacrificed for the homeland she said smiling He is in my heart I talk to him and it makes me feel better she said The town nestled amid olive groves has lost 34 men so far said mayor Mohammed Shaban Reflecting a broader trend Shaban said most of the men were killed in the past two years mostly by the alQaidalinked Nusra Front and in mass killings perpetrated by the extremist Islamic State group as they seized a string of military bases in the countrys northeast Among the massacres was the killing of more than 150 government troops captured when the militants took the Tabqa base in Raqqa province in August The militants stripped the soldiers to their underwear and forced to run through the desert before they were shot We cant live with them We are fighting ignorance and terrorism said Issa Mariam 54 whose son Abdullah was killed two years ago fighting in Aleppo Posters of Abdullah 25 were plastered around the house alongside his framed death certificate His mother also bore a gold pendant bearing Abdullahs image There appears to be growing resentment toward Assad particularly after the mass killings by militants Some families say they felt their sons were sacrificed for the survival of one family But as Islamic militants become more powerful many Syrians see little choice    better Assads rule than the extremists An aid worker who works closely with Syrian officials said because the fate of Alawites was tied with Assads rule some were demanding the government pound rebel areas harder If anything their critique of Bashar is that he is too weak so they would rather have a hardline guy in power said the aid worker who requested anonymity because he wasnt meant to speak to reporters A demonstration in early October in an Alawitedominated neighborhood of the central Syrian city of Homs may be instructive After twin bombings killed 25 children there hundreds of Assad supporters held a rare protest accusing the Homs governor of not doing enough to stop rebel attacks on their neighborhood Haidar the school teacher who lost his soldier son suggested there was weariness Certain provinces are motivated to go to the army and perhaps they are affected more Haidar said referring to Tartous Many people were killed and they are buried here in this cemetery The government appears to be trying to mitigate potential dissent A Syrian economics expert said the state was prioritizing social affairs spending on families of slain soldiers But a decision to grant first priority in civil service jobs to those families was cancelled this week said the Health Minister Nizar Yaziji It appeared that the decision had caused an outcry As the war grinds on with no decisive winner and no political headway the military is becoming low on personnel resources meaning therell be no rest for Alawites soon They will have to be patient what can they do said Assad adviser Bouthaina Shabaan We all in Syria have to be patient and we all have to persist in our resilience What is the alternative This week soldiers at checkpoints in Tartous began stopping men aged between 23 and 42 years old examining their ID cards and ordering some of them to report for reserve duty Men were taking alternative routes to avoid being caught There was no formal announcement of the move and an official on staterun television this week denied what he called rumors that men were being seized Parents of slain Alawite soldiers said they would allow their other sons to volunteer service if they wanted But the price is clear In the provincial capital city of Tartous an informal mural made of the posters of slain soldiers stretched for meters on a wall Further down there was an official memorial it was a large billboard featuring Assads face and thousands of names of slain soldiers scrawled on either side Across the road there was another billboard also listing names of the killed It too was full,2014-10-31T08:00-04:00,guns

loss He has rushed for two touchdowns and was named one of 15 semifinalists for the Butkus Award as the best linebacker in college football Yet its tough to shake the feeling that Jacks second season with the No 25 Bruins 62 32 Pac12 is a disappointment because he has yet to live up to the enormous expectations that followed winning both the Pac12 offensive and defensive freshman of the year awards     And that makes Jack the living embodiment of the Bruins season so far where the results on the field have not matched the hype off of it While a spot in the inaugural College Football Playoff is all but out of the question UCLA can put itself back into the thick of the Pac12 South race with a win over No 14 Arizona 61 31 on Saturday night There have been tight games but we have pulled through in a lot of them and we understand that we still have the opportunity to do what we need to do and to get to where we want to go which is the Pac12 championship quarterback Brett Hundley said We can still do it Despite needing double overtime to beat Colorado in a game in which UCLA squandered three different 17point leads receiver Jordan Payton insisted that the outcome labeled us as a resilient and tough team From the outside it looks like Oh they are struggling Payton added They are barely winning these games But guys are fighting over here UCLA has spent nearly all season fighting criticism having put together only one complete game Hundley and his offensive line took most of the blame for UCLAs initial struggles but Jack and the defensive front have struggled to stop the run lately The Buffaloes rushed for 233 yards becoming the third opponent with at least 200 yards on the ground in the Bruins last four games Jack blamed too many attempts at trying to deliver a big hit instead of sure form tackling for much of the yardage the Buffaloes were able to accumulate noting that those kinds of errors in the open field are what make the Wildcats spread offense so dangerous We cant have a lapse against them or it is going to be a highscoring game and were going to be very embarrassed at the end Jack said We are going to have to come out guns blazing and maintain that throughout the whole game Arizona has actually leaned much more heavily on the pass this season than during Rich Rodriguezs first two seasons throwing the ball 53 percent of the time That should play to Jacks strengths having established himself as one of the best linebackers in coverage in the nation with 17 career pass breakups and two interceptions But Jack showed a new dimension against Colorado when he was called on to blitz Jack nearly had two sacks which would have doubled his career total but was unable to bring down quarterback Sefo Liufau Jack acknowledged he is very raw as a pass rusher and spends extra time before and after practice to develop those skills Its just something that I never really worked on or never really focused on in high school or even getting here Jack said Its not really a natural thing that I do and thats something that I have to work on Ill get better at it Whether UCLA as a whole can show the necessary improvement to save

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/27/weed-booze-and-bears-ballot-questions-compete-with-candidates-for-voters/, While candidates and parties duke it out for victory on Election Day a justasheated battle is being waged in a number of states over guns abortion booze marijuana  even bears Ballot initiatives often are the sidebar story of any election but for some voters the debate this year over yes or no on a range of ballot questions has been the marquee issue drawing millions of dollars to each side and in some cases forcing candidates running in those states to take a position     One of the highestprofile battles again is over weed After Colorado and Washington became the first states to effectively legalize  and regulate  nonmedical marijuana in the last election the propot movement is trying to expand the legal weed map next week Unlike several past elections gay marriage is not on the ballot this year But other social and economic hot buttons including the minimum wage are According to electiontracker Ballotpedia voters are weighing in on 153 ballot measures on Election Day Marijuana bans up in smoke Two years ago voters in Colorado and Washington legalized recreational pot statewide and the federal government largely has stayed out of their business On Nov 4 Oregon which voted down such a measure in 2012 Alaska and the District of Columbia will ask voters whether they too want to join the marijuana legalization experiment Promarijuana voices like Morgan Fox at the Marijuana Policy Project say the prospects for legalization are looking good Polls have shown voters in Oregon and DC largely support the measures though voters views toward legalizing weed in Alaska are still a bit hazy Florida with its huge senior community also has a question on the ballot on legalizing medical marijuana They all seem like they are pretty close except for DC which has overwhelming support Fox said But I think they all stand a very good chance of passing Last week Sen Jeff Merkley DOre became the first US senator to support marijuana legalization for his state Drug Policy Action which has received major funding from billionaire currency trader George Soros contributed 500000 to the Yes on 91 campaign in Oregon Washington DCbased New Approach PAC tied to the family of the late billionaire Peter Lewis gave 300000 to the effort Big money plays a huge role in the yes campaign said Kevin Sabet legalization opponent and cofounder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana SAM You have millions of dollars poured in to the yes side and on the no side you just have a lot of volunteers from citizens and groups that dont traditionally have a lot of money They are trying to manipulate from the outside End of the dry spell There arent many places that still ban alcohol though 10 states including Arkansas still have areas that do A ballot initiative that would legalize booze statewide is pitting big fundraising guns at WalMart which wants to want to end prohibition against the liquor dealers who want to keep it It promises to be a big draw on Nov 4 According to local reports 37 out of Arkansas 75 counties prohibit the sale and purchase of alcohol Business interests like WalMart want to be able to sell beer and wine over the counter everywhere in Arkansas Liquor dealers who operate shops just outside dry counties have lined up to defeat the measure known as Issue 4 An October poll by Talk Business  Politics found that 54 percent of voters opposed lifting prohibition statewide Dueling gun measures Following the elementary school shooting massacre at Sandy Hook and other highprofile tragedies involving firearms gun control advocates have been pouring cash into legislative efforts as well as ballot initiatives Washington state has two dueling gun measures at the ballot box on Nov 4 If both win it likely will tie up the issue in court Initiative 594 calls for a comprehensive tightening of the states background check policies  requiring background checks for virtually all purchases including online and gunshow sales Opponents including the National Rifle Association NRA have been vastly outspent as the campaign heads into the last week According to a report in September the proI594 funders including former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg and Bill and Melinda Gates have given 75 million toward its passage Competing measure I591 is supported by gun rights advocates and would do the opposite by barring the state from enacting its own backgroundcheck laws deferring to the federal government on that front It also would prohibit government agencies from seizing guns without due process Dont feed the bears A ballot initiative drawing major national attention in Maine would restrict the way residents can hunt for bears Right now hunters can use a range of tactics to kill their quarry  from trapping and chasing them down with dogs to baiting them with sweets like jelly doughnuts All three methods would be banned if Question 1 passes Maine hunters would have to stalk and shoot bears the oldfashioned way which is more humane proponents say Critics say it would balloon Maines bear population Both sides have spent some 16 million on TV ads to persuade the public Abortion Three state measures would challenge some abortions In Colorado voters will decide whether to amend the state constitution to define the fetus as a person under the criminal code In North Dakota voters weigh the question of whether the state constitution should protect the rights of the unborn In Tennessee a measure would make it easier for the state to pass restrictions on abortion Drugtesting docs and malpractice In California voters will decide whether to require doctors to submit to drugtesting the first such policy in the country Proposition 46 also would raise the cap on painandsuffering awards Proponents say it would be a win for patients while critics say it all amounts to a grab by tort lawyers Sentencing reform Prison overcrowded California is weighing Prop 47 which would dramatically change how the state treats certain nonserious nonviolent drug and property crimes by downgrading them from felonies to misdemeanors The measure also would allow those currently serving time for such offenses to apply for a reduced sentence as long as they have no prior convictions for more serious crimes like murder attempted murder or sexual offenses Minimum wage Several states are asking voters to decide minimum wage increases A South Dakota measure would hike the rate from 725 an hour to 850 An Alaska measure would raise it from 775 an hour to over two years 975 Arkansas and Nebraska also have similar measures on the ballot Illinois is asking voters about the minimum wage but the result is

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/10/12/despite-demands-syria-no-fly-zone-no-go-for-us/, WASHINGTON  The Obama administrations promise to limit US military engagement against Islamic State militants makes it difficult to accept Turkeys terms for joining the fight in neighboring Syria Turkey and other American allies want the US to create a nofly zone inside Syrian territory Yet doing that would mean embracing one of two options President Barack Obama long has resisted cooperating with Syrian President Bashar Assads government or taking out its air defenses an action tantamount to war     There are increasing demands for the creation of a secure buffer on the Syrian side of the border with Turkey The US and others in the coalition fighting the militants are pleading with Turkey a NATO ally to prevent the fall of Kobani a border town where the United Nations is warning of mass casualties A safe zone would require Americans and their partners to protect ground territory and patrol the sky meaning enforcement of a nofly area For Turkey a buffer might stem the flow of refugees and could give Syrian opposition fighters a staging ground for their drive to oust Assad an Ankara aim The US wants to keep the focus on combating Islamic State militants who have captured large areas of northern Syria and Iraq Some of Americas closest partners and Obamas fiercest foreign policy critics are sympathetic to Turkeys request France came out in support this past week The Republican leader of the House Foreign Affairs Committee believes Arab countries would shoulder the load Even Secretary of State John Kerry says a nofly zone is worth examining Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has shown little enthusiasm saying American leaders are open to discussing a safe zone but creating one isnt actively being considered For the US military there are red flags about establishing an area in Syria safe from attacks by the Islamic State group and Syrias air force Gen Martin Dempsey the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has estimated it would require hundreds of US aircraft and cost as much as 1 billion a month to maintain with no assurance of a change in battlefield momentum toward ending the Syrian civil war That means US enforcement could become openended The Pentagon learned that lesson in Iraq when in 1991 in the aftermath of the Gulf War it established a nofly zone over northern Iraq to protect Iraqi Kurds and another protective zone over southern Iraq to protect Shiites Those zones were enforced by US Air Force and Navy pilots for a dozen years until the March 2003 invasion of Iraq A zone in Syria would set the stage for a direct confrontation with one of the Mideasts most formidable air defenses a system bolstered in recent years by topoftheline Russian hardware The Syrians possess multiple surfacetoair missiles providing overlapping coverage and thousands of antiaircraft guns capable of engaging attacking aircraft at lower levels Moscow infuriated Washington last year when it confirmed that it would sell to Syria its S300 antiaircraft missiles considered to be the cutting edge in aircraft interception technology The political challenges of a nofly zone may prove even greater Given the threat to US pilots the Pentagon would need rescue personnel stationed nearby perhaps in Turkey or Iraq If a plane were downed American troops then would have to hit the ground in Syria which Obama repeatedly has ruled out Direct military action against Assads government also would stretch the United States already tenuous claims that intervening in Syria is legal under US and international law Many members of Congress are challenging Obamas justification for war on the basis of the Bush administrations 2001 authorization to fight alQaida The Islamic State group grew from the alQaida movement but the two now are enemies The US has no UN mandate to wage war in Syria The US could try for an accommodation with Assad But even if Syrian forces are similarly battling the Islamic State militants Obama has ruled that out because of alleged human rights violations and war crimes by those forces Western governments and human rights groups cite massacres of civilians and opposition forces and chemical weapons attacks by Assads troops Washington is searching for an alternative approach with Turkey On Friday retired Marine Gen John Allen the US special envoy and his State Department deputy Brett McGurk met in Ankara with Turkish officials and NATOs secretarygeneral More USTurkey talks were set for this coming week Turkey says it

members in a fierce shootout three soldiers are being charged with homicide The announcement late Tuesday was just another step in dismantling the official version of the June 30 confrontation which came under question almost immediately because of the lopsided outcome Only one soldier was injured     But Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karams version of events raised more questions about the killings in an abandoned warehouse in southern Mexico that a witness said happened after the suspects had surrendered   and that the UN urged be investigated as possible summary executions After a brief initial firefight with eight soldiers three of them entered a warehouse where the suspects had taken refuge and opened fire with no justification whatsoever Murillo Karam said in a news conference  He offered no details on whether the suspects had already surrendered whether they were unarmed or how three soldiers could kill 21 people without anyone trying to flee a wideopen hangarlike building One suspect was killed in the initial firefight according to the witness Doesnt it seem strange that eight soldiers face off against 22 suspects and all the deaths are on the side of those with numeric superiority said Alejandro Hope a Mexico Citybased security analyst What was this a squad of Rambos Or had the suspects already been disarmed Whichever way this doesnt smell good The military initially said that the prolonged confrontation occurred when a patrol unit came under fire in the town of San Pedro Limon an area in Mexico state known to be dominated by drug cartels The witness who asked that her name not be used for fear of reprisals told The AP that the army fired first She said the 21 had given up and walked out of the warehouse and that soldiers led them back inside and killed them  Her daughter 15yearold Erika Gomez Gonzalez who had been wounded in the leg in the initial shootout was turned over and shot several times in the torso the witness said She said Tuesday that all of the soldiers at the scene were involved in the shooting not just three though she couldnt remember exactly how many were present Though the incident occurred three months ago she said she still hasnt been interviewed by federal investigators and by Mexicos human rights investigators just within the last two weeks The attorney generals office would not say if it had interviewed the witness and the human rights commission couldnt be immediately reached for comment An AP review of the warehouse days after the shooting showed a few stray shots and no sprays of gunfire within the large grain warehouse where the alleged gang was hiding Instead bullet holes and blood stains indicated some were shot near or against the walls at close range Photographs from the scene leaked to a local news agency showed most of the bodies against the wall with guns lying near or propped against them to appear as if they went down shooting Last week the army detained one officer and seven soldiers for disobedience and dereliction of duty in relation to the incident Those charges are separate from the attorney generals civil probe Murillo Karam said Tuesday a squad of seven soldiers and a lieutenant were involved in the killings  While a battalion has about 550 soldiers normally platoons of about 30 led by a lieutenant are sent to fight drug traffickers according to a person close to the military who was not authorized to the speak to the press Murillo Karam said five of the eightman squad appeared to have stayed outside while the killings occurred He said there were doubts about one enlisted mans account that could lead to a fourth set of charges They would be formally arraigned on Wednesday he added From the start we had detected some inconsistencies he said But he did not explain why it took federal investigators 2  months to file charges His office would not say when it took the case from the prosecutor in Mexico state AP reporters revisited the bodega two weeks ago and there were no signs of a federal investigation But photographs in the national newspaper Milenio on Tuesday showed the warehouse roped off with attorney generals office caution tape and markings of the bullet holes indicating that investigators only arrived within the last two weeks Nor did Murillo Karam explain why his findings directly contradicted those of Mexico state prosecutors who said in a July 15 statement that their investigations had found an equal exchange of fire and no evidence at all of any possible execution He did not address the fact that autopsy reports on the victims have been classified as state secrets for nine years Rights groups have said the killings may prove to be one of the most serious massacres in Mexico in recent memory The civilian justice system has been totally discredited and looks very bad said Raul Benitez a security expert at Mexicos National Autonomous University  It looks as if they dont perform objective investigations but rather do them for political purposes and to cover up crimes,2014-10-01T01:40-04:00,guns
Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2014/10/14/blue-jackets-eye-3-0-start-in-clash-with-stars/,"SportsNetworkcom  The Columbus Blue Jackets and Dallas Stars both entered    this season expecting to be teams on the rise So far only the Blue Jackets    are showing it Columbus takes aims at a 30 start to the season when it hosts the winless 
  Stars at Nationwide Arena on Tuesday The Blue Jackets made the playoffs for just the second time in club history 
  last spring while setting franchise records for wins 43 and points 93 
  Although Columbus lost in the opening round to Pittsburgh the team did earn 
  its first two playoff victories in the series and is hoping to build upon that 
  postseason experience in 201415 Columbus began the season with a road win at Buffalo and then slammed the 
  visiting New York Rangers by a 52 score on Saturday Cam Atkinson notched a 
  pair of goals to help the Jackets upend the defending Eastern Conference 
  champions in the home opener at Nationwide Arena Nick Foligno and rookie Marko Dano each added a goal an assist against New 
  York Former Ranger Artem Anisimov also scored to support a 24save effort 
  from Sergei Bobrovsky The Blue Jackets set the tone Saturday with a strong opening period Columbus 
  recorded a pair of goals and also received 10 saves from a sharp Bobrovsky 
  New York was never able to recover from that point as the Jackets held the 
  lead the rest of the way We did a lot of things at the start of the game that will allow us to have 
  success said Blue Jackets head coach Todd Richards I like the way we stuck 
  at it out there in all areas Bobrovsky expects to get the start again as Columbus plays the middle test of 
  a threegame homestand a residency that is set to end Friday against Calgary After making the playoffs last spring for the first time since 2008 Dallas 
  also entered 201415 with the promise of better days ahead Instead Lindy 
  Ruffs team has begun slowly with just three goals during an 011 start to 
  the season The Stars who acquired centerman Jason Spezza in a blockbuster trade during 
  the offseason earned a point in Thursdays 32 shootout loss against visiting 
  Chicago but then fell 41 in Nashville on Saturday Dallas scored its only goal Saturday at 714 of the first period Nashville 
  tied the game late in the second on a Shea Weber goal and Paul Gaustad put the 
  Predators ahead for good at 833 of the third period Antoine Roussel potted the lone Dallas goal and Anders Lindback a former 
  Predator stopped 29of32 shots in the loss The Stars are looking for their big guns to break out in the third game of the 
  season Spezza has recorded one assist in his first two games with Dallas 
  while fellow forwards Jamie Benn and Tyler Seguin have yet to record a point 
  on the young season Ruff said theres a possibility hell tinker with the forward lines to try and 
  get his offense on track Its something we want to look at the Stars coach said Monday I was 
  really happy with the effort and everything that went into game one Game two 
  not so much With matchups on the road it might give me some different 
  options I told those guys it is something I want to look at in practice and 
  well see where we are  when we get on the road The Stars also could be without forward Valeri Nichushkin who is questionable 
  after sustaining a lowerbody injury in Saturdays loss Kari Lehtonen is likely to get the start in net for Dallas tonight as it plays 
  the middle test of a threegame road trip The Stars No 1 goaltender is 551 
  with a 191 goals against average and 936 save percentage in 11 career 
  outings against Columbus The Blue Jackets have won three straight and four of the last five meetings 
  against Dallas and the Stars have dropped two of their past three tilts at

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/10/02/bush-opens-obamas-handling-iraq-isis/,This is a rush transcript from The Five October 2 2014 This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated ERIC BOLLING COHOST Hello everyone Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle Bob Beckel Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld its 5 oclock in New York City and this is The Five     All right in a moment youre gonna hear some fascinating sound from a Muslim who says he attended the same mosque where the Oklahoma beheading suspect practiced Islam What he says goes on in private in that mosque will shock you Plus this BEGIUN VIDEO CLIP NOOR The teaching that Islam allows three choices to be made in nonMuslims and eventually theyre all going to have to make that choice to convert to live under Islamic rule or die END OF VIDEO CLIP BOLLING As President Bush predicted wed be forced to confront an enemy far greater than Al Qaeda if we left Iraq too soon He was right today He spoke to Fox News for the very first time about that ominous warning and the state of Iraq today BEGIN VIDEO CLIP KILMEADE You knew it in 2007 In fact this is George Bush President George Bush in 2007 before the surge GEORGE W BUSH FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Begin withdrawing before our commanders tell us were ready would be dangerous	It means that wed be risking mass killings on a horrific scale It means increasing the probability that American troops would have to return at some later date to confront an enemy that is even more dangerous KILMEADE How did you know BUSH Well I know the nature of the enemy Anybody who kills 3000 innocents and beheads people because of their religion or because of their point of view is dangerous Democracy takes time to take hold and yet theres impatience with that process in the Americans Americans have got to understand that the lesson of 911 is still important today as it was right after 911 END OF VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Also what is he think about President Obamas decision to pull our troops out and let terrorists take over the country Heres more from 43 BEGIN VIDEO CLIP KILMEADE Martin Dempsey came out as chairman of joint his status says well known the military recommended and we leave a residual force of 10000 to 15000 maybe more Did you feel the same way BUSH I did yeah I agreed with General Dempseys assessment END OF VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Alright Bob Well open it to you because we have a lot of sound from President Bush Your thoughts on the  really the first comments since he really predicted what was going on now back in 2007 BOB BECKEL COHOST You have to understand where Im coming from I dont think any of this would have happened if we hadnt gone to war in Iraq Saddam Hussein had done a lot of things that were bad but not nearly as bad as these guys He was being contained there was a no fly zone the Kurds were being protected More importantly he kept the Iranians in check When the administration went on that I assume they believe were accurate stories about weapons of mass destruction Colin Powell called his performance at the UN The most embarrassing thing hed ever done in his public life when he was forced to give testimony to the UN about why there were weapons of mass destruction The question really is could 10000 or 15000 people have been there and for how long 10 20 30 40 years and would that really have stopped this Youre talking about secretary on violence it was back over 2000 years I think it was a bad decision to go in The end product of it is were seeing it today BOLLING Maybe the bad decision was to pull out too soon and as we pointed out George Bush predicted that if we had let pulled out if we let the residual force in Iraq maybe we wouldnt have Americans beheaded on tape DANA PERINO COHOST So if you read Thomas Joscelyn of the Weekly Standard who writes about the enemy and the nature of the enemy as President Bush was describing But the grand plan was to build out from Afghanistan Al Qaeda And now you have all these other groups that have metastasized that are being called different names but the truth is it is all Al Qaeda Theres a  theres of two things basically what President Bush is saying when he agrees with General Dempsey its no different than what Secretary Gates Secretary Clinton Secretary Panetta and General Petraeus have all said the first three of those all in books so theyre on record saying that they disagree with the presidents decision to leave Iraq at the time  or not to leave more of a force there Bob that is true I dont know why youre breathing heavy but thats true CROSSTALK BECKEL Im not breathing Im listening to you PERINO that cabinet secretary BOLLING You know he breathes heavy all the time PERINO I know you can see from my point of view hes always like breathing deep Those are facts The only people who seem to think that was not a good idea were Obama Biden and Susan Rice Now thats their prerogative and  but there are consequences for decisions as youre seeing The second thing I wanted to mention is we cut the sound bite a little bit too early because I liked the second part of what President Bush said In regards to lesson after 911 is that Americans need to understand the west needs to understand that the human condition around the world matters And it matters to our national security That is the broader foreign policy thinking of the Bush administration I think its also important he  the president didnt give an interview to Brian Kilmeade today to talk about this per se of course he knew he would be asked about it I guess But the purpose of inviting them down there was to talk about the fourth annual 2015 warrior open that is a big golf tournament that supports Iraqi and Afghanistan war veterans BOLLING Let me bring these guys in We have a lot more sound to get to Thoughts on that first interview after  GREG GUTFELD COHOST To Bobs point we have placed troops in countries for decades after wars so its something that we do to maintain the peace and sometimes it lasts a long time That war had been won but it wasnt Obamas war to win so it was ours to lose It was like President Obama had moved into a new apartment and somebody had left the shower curtain behind but that wasnt his shower curtain so he just got rid of it Thats what he did with the Iraq war BOLLING KG your thoughts let me get on KG on this one because we got another piece of sound from Bush go ahead KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE COHOST I just take issue with taking that shot at President Bush and trying to despair a chance ph where hes been nothing but a gentleman and a class act been unbelievably respectful and empathetic to the difficult job that President Obama had BOLLING Stay right there CROSSTALK BOLLING Bob hold on thats a great transition to the next one What does President Bush think of President Obama allowing ISIS to rise in Iraq	Listen BEGIN VIDEO CLIP BUSH The president has to make the choices he thinks are important Im not going to second guess our president I understand how tough the job is	And to have a former president you know bloviating and secondguessing is I dont think good for the presidency or the country KILMEADE Does President Obama call you BUSH Well he called me to tell me that the nation killed Osama bin Laden are the inaudible and the law enforcer are grateful But now hes been  you know hes not on a regular basis which is OK It doesnt hurt my feelings Its a decision he has made END OF VIDEO CLIP BOLLING I want to get to Dana in a second but go ahead GUILFOYLE Well he goes on to say that he understands President Obama has developed a relationship over six years with people that he trust and that seeks counsel in so this is the bigger man Im saying you know what I dont mind if he needs me Im here But the point is theres always lessons to be learned from history and past presidents have had a history of in fact contacting their predecessors Because there was something to be cleaned and learned from that being the one person on opposition to power And with respect to President Bush you didnt see him take a shot and say told you so I was right about this We should have done  we should have finished the job by allowing the Iraqi people to have the benefit of ongoing support so that we could have not made what the veterans fought for in vain by seeing intensified by them BECKEL Just out of curiosity what former presidents consulted other presidents for big decisions BOLLING He did BECKEL For what BOLLING Bill Clinton said that Bush called him GUILFOYLE Called him BECKEL Yeah BOLLING Theres one GUILFOYLE Twice a year and BECKEL Talking about bringing them is generally presidents dont GUILFOYLE For different with Nixon Yeah I mean theres a history of it CROSSTALK PERINO The reason behind with that Bob is because in the Wall Street Journal there was a very important column by Bret Stephens on Tuesday in which it suggested that President Obama could benefit from a call from  with President Bush or having a more of a relationship while talking to him But that is based on reports from mostly from Bill Clinton but President Bush is comment on  commented on it as well that Bush and Clinton developed a good working relationship and a friendship and camaraderie during the Bush administration GUILFOYLE That continues to this day PERINO Yeah GUTFELD The bottom line is President Obama took the surge personally because he was against us and punished us nationally because of a petulant adolescent reaction to something that proved him incorrect BECKEL Can you explain to me what you said this over and over again This war was won How do you mean it was GUTFELD The surge The surge  was the surge a failure PERINO The surge worked GUTFELD There was a vote There was democracy there was calm There was a surge and then it all went to hell BECKEL What about corruption GUTFELD Corruption is around in every start of every country we know that CROSSTALK BECKEL But if corruption in our country now GUILFOYLE But because the men and women that served the country valiantly felt that they had achieved the goal and everybody who was there that was on the ground knew that we need to keep the position strong so that they could continue to succeed otherwise its like pulling the sheet out from under them BOLLING Lets bring this to the today and now to terror right here at home There was a Jihadstyle beheading here in America a few days ago and the administration can still only call it workplace violence But listen closely to a man Megyn Kelly spoke to last night He says he attended the same mosque where the Oklahoma suspect worshipped we could roll it there and the terror was taught there BEGIN VIDEO CLIP NOOR To the public the mosque will not promote terrorism or any kind of radical acts but when theyre among friends and congregants only they will promote the true teachings of Islam which include the offer to non Muslims the choice rather that you must convert live under Islamic rule or be fought against Jihad Fisabilillah Jihad for the sake of Allah END OF VIDEO CLIP BOLLING And the Oklahoma mass was similar ph was also exposes the congregations true feelings about bin Laden and those horrific beheadings BEGIN VIDEO CLIP NOOR I had two friends at the mosque One of them is now an Imam The men told me that if Osama bin Laden came to their door they would invite him in and protect him because he was a brother Muslim and we must protect him for those who dont believe MEGYN KELLY THE KELLY FILE HOST Did they ever discuss the subject of beheadings Was that ever discussed NOOR The only time that beheadings were discussed was in the means at which you confront the infidel as this is related into Quran That when you meet the unbelievers you should smile at their necks END OF VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Alright Greg so now if you need more proof of terrorize GUTFELD Yeah But we didnt even need to hear it from him If this victim was already dead which I think she was why did he behead her Because what would be the point The point is was to spread terror to send a message and that makes it terror So why dont we just compromise and call it workplace terror Just get rid of the violence Well lets all agree one spot and say it happened at the workplace its terror By the way were so focused on his actions but in hate crimes were always focused on intent Why is it with this action  with this crime its all about the action and not the intent The opposite will hate crimes BECKEL You know son the thing about this is and Ive been saying this for a long time I got beat up by saying you should no more mosques A lot of this stuff is going on a lot of mosques They raise money for terrorists they  some not all of them but a lot of them preach a brand of Islam that is not acceptable I think in mainstream is long But you know this is not new to me this is you know we were pulled back and	inaudible I dont think we should have and that theyre training a lot of people GUTFELD But I dont think you can say all mosques BECKEL No I didnt do that I said some of them GUILFOYLE No I mean look this is again you know further evidence and further proof and to pick up on more of what youre talking about yeah why wouldnt we take him at his words that describe so in  his intent	What his actions were combine with what was in his mind and his ideology about committing Jihad a symbolic then if in fact she was deceased to cut her head off I mean thats exactly what he was trying to achieve in that moment Take him for his word and his actions PERINO One of the things I really liked about seeing that and appreciating the interview is that right before it they talked  they had a reporter out there who was saying  to the mosque representative you were about  you said you would talk to us and all of a sudden you changed your mind	The reason that interview I think is important is that you have very little communication coming out of the mosque Thats why there has been the need to do some sort of surveillance at times that they think was a specific threat GUILFOYLE An infiltration PERINO Yeah that was on the merits GUILFOYLE Yeah PERINO So this information that we get firsthand from somebody that was actually there and then goes back that he reveals last night on in that interview because of a law enforcement request is very interesting Shes going to have a second part tonight I dont know if she asked but Im kinda  Im curious about this question What led him to the mosque in the first place What was it that he was BECKEL This guy CROSSTALK PERINO What was he looking for I think that would give us even a different picture GUILFOYLE And did he come in contact with someone who specifically kind of encouraged him or put the idea in his head Because its all about them inspiring and reaching out and trying further the tentacles of terror BOLLING And  you know I mean obviously I mean I know the answer to this question but why do you have to be in silhouette You have to be in silhouette because if youre a whistleblower in a mosque about Islam youre likely going to be the next one beheaded or at least threatened GUILFOYLE Youre DOA BOLLING Unfortunately I think about all the other whistleblowers that are on TV They talk about you know exposing corruption in the government or exposing corruption in a business or a company or what now But if you expose corruption or terrorism in a mosque youre likely risking your life for it CROSSTALK GUTFELD Either that or had a bad hair day BOLLING That too GUILFOYLE It looks like he was wearing a cap GUTFELD Yeah BOLLING Should we go LAUGHTER	Well go Alright before we go a programming note dont miss Gretas big interviews tonight with the prime minister of Israel tonight PVnet and Yahoo warns about the dire threat of global Jihad Heres a peek BEGIN VIDEO CLIP NETANYAHU The problem is that militant Islam is trying to dominate the Middle East and then take over the world Its number one target ultimately is the United States They view all these branches shiites radical shiites radical sunnis they see you as the great state They call us the small state because were just a frontal position a forward position of the United States They want to destroy us so they can get to you END OF VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Thats 700 pm Eastern tonight Then coming up instead of focusing on the Jihad crisis our president is focusing today on helping his party win their election Dana is all over that here on The Five PERINO So is America better off than it was six years ago More than half the country says no according to a recent Fox poll and that includes 37 percent of Democrats With the midterms fast approaching the president is trying to convince voters otherwise at least when it comes to the economy	He spoke today BEGIN VIDEO CLIP BARRACK OBAMA PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA We can and should be proud of the progress that our country has made over these past six years It is indisputable that our economy is stronger today than when I took office I said we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation for growth and prosperity and with dedicated persistent effort weve actually been laying the cornerstones of this foundation every single day since END OF VIDEO CLIP PERINNO OK So Eric let me start with you our financial expert Is it not true that you are  in every recession the country does better six years later The question is the relevancy  or I mean how relative it is to growth and how its potential BOLLING The most important thing is growth and how soon do you get back to normal growth It took us six years and we may not be there Heres the point though President Obama today used those words he wrote part of that sound by it says Its indisputable and then went on to say by every economic measure America is better off He said they is  lets deal in facts Mr President I listened to your speech Ill deal in facts if you want These are apples to apples comparisons from the day he took over to today Median household income is down thats a fact Household ownership rate is down thats a fact Gasoline prices are up Way up thats a fact	Milk prices are at an alltime high Up way up And the last one number of Americans receiving food stamps is way way up We know the numbers about labor participation force  a participation rate is down PERINO Went down BOLLING I mean I can name 20 different facts that are disputable that America is better off BECKEL How about  how about some of these facts BOLLING All Im saying is that hes said Lets sure in facts say its indisputable and by CROSSTALK BECKEL Is it ever  2008 that this country be better off on this day then 	BOLLING I just gave you 5 minutes BECKEL Youre in a whole close to it did fresh BOLLING Hows this Go to our Facebook The Five fan Facebook page whatever it is right now Facebookcom and Ill put all the facts up for it that show that were not better off BECKEL Do you mind if I share a few facts too the number of jobs have grown from 215000 that a faster pace since 1999 Theres been no inflation The stock market is up Profits are up in the  across the board Still the wages on  GUTFELD Wait a second I thought you would hate that PERONO Yeah right GUILFOYLE Bob said GUTFELD I thought you would hate  profits PERINO Whoa GUTFELD You just had a 400000 person march against profits BECKEL Who is Louise ph CROSSTALK GUTFELD You know he wants to say the economy is on an upward trajectory	So were North Korean missile tests Its never happened Hes making middle class households poorer If being  making people poor is progress he is a progressive Its incredible I just dont get it Bob when you say youre for profits one day and then youre not the previous BECKEL I am always been for profits Im not against profits I understand GUILFOYLE I wanna flag on the play BECKEL I know profits are necessary for growth Im not a communist despite what you may think GUTFELD You have admitted to being a communist BECKEL Well I said that in jest GUILFOYLE Not this week CROSSTALK BECKEL The point is that he has got the right political thing to do is to move to the economy Hes got some things he can talk about a thing he can brag about and thats what the democrats need PERINO What I think theyre missing and Im curious where it is maybe Kimberly well get you in on this which is the bigger idea So lets give	 lets stipulate that OK So we were in a financial crisis and a panic in the fall of 2008 The president takes over Six years later the country still  there Im saying the polling says that they dont feel like its good enough GUILFOYLE Yeah PERINO So where is the big idea I mean see the minimum wage piece But other than that what is the president talking about I didnt see anything else that was new today GUILFOYLE No of course not but this is the only the material that he has to work with Somebody is like here are the cue cards these are the things we can hit you have to pivot to the economy Its a very you know typical Obama policy speech growth for this many numbers of quarters hes such a  hes got to seize on what he can right Because midterms are coming up so this is a point of crisis He has to go for what at least he can have something positive to say The problem is the public the American people the voters arent buying it so theres a disconnection So hes just hoping that perception is reality if he says it enough BECKEL Can somebody please give us exactly question was that CROSSTALK GUILFOYLE Well here  just so you know the Fox News poll of the 911 BECKEL Yeah you know the question the exact question was that GUILFOYLE Voters dont agree with the presidents assessment that the country is better off They dismiss the presidents boast as mostly false by a 58 to 36 percent margin That includes 37 percent of the senate Democrats BECKEL Thats right Thats what I thought the question It was not about their own economic situation PERINO But Bob the president is the one who in 60 minutes hes the who asked  who posed the question that way Actually we were just quoting the president in that question CROSSTALK PERINO I want to roll this because the president took a little bit of personal shot at this network today in a speech Take a look BEGIN VIDEO CLIP OBAMA Theres a reason fewer republicans you hear them running around about Obamacare Because while good affordable health care might seem like a fanged threat to the freedom of American people LAUGHTER On fox news it turns out its working pretty well in the real world APPLAUSE END OF VIDEO CLIP 	PERINO Greg have you gotten under his skin GUTFELD He bashes at FNC more than ISIS and we dont behead anybody But you know the bitter point here if theres anybody in the media that likes the fact that its not them that hes angry at you shouldnt be because that means youre a wuss Youre a pliant servant in his harem The only reason why his coming after Fox News is where the only network that actually tries to challenge him CROSSTALK BECKEL Can I ask you a question Everybody around this table said six months ago particularly Eric run on Obamacare were not gonna get it I dont know a single Republican thats making a case on Obamacare and I dont know any Democrats PERINO I dont know what youre reading because a lot of people  theyre not make it a singular issue but its one of many issues BECKEL Its one of the many issue But did remember this was supposed to be the singular issue BOLLING Because theres so many work LAUGHTER CROSSTALK GUILFOYLE Why would you stick with one There are ten issues BOLLNG IRS Ebola theres this border the southern border BECKEL Is Ebola his fault too BOLLING No Bob you will not get in that CROSSTALK BECKEL Im not gonna stop yelling BOLLING That Fox News ph shot wasnt off the cuff That was written right We got an embargo  a copy of that speech before you delivery it and someone actually wrote that line so there was the key back in it wherever they put the speeches together they took a shot at us CROSSTALK PERINO If I would have ever had address speech sent to me that I had for review the president where it took a shot at MSNBC I think I would have  I wouldve been on the ceiling The thing is heres the thing the president never would have said it President Bush never would have said it BOLLING Can I just respond to Bob Ebola five letters Obama five letters CROSSTALK PERINO Were going to get an ice bag in the commercial break And update on the Ebola scare ahead should the US close their airports to travelers from countries with outbreaks Well tell you how the CDC feels about that coming up COMMERCIAL BREAK GUTFELD Its a great song A new website aims to remind everyone that Republicans are people too as if thats really possible BEGIN VIDEO CLIP GRAPHIC Republicans drive Priuses Republicans recycle Republicans listen to Spotify Republicans put together IKEA furniture Republicans read The New York Times in public Republicans have tattoos and beards	Republicans have feelings Republicans are people who care Republicans are people too END VIDEO CLIP GUTFELD I get it They dont drink the blood of baby pandas after all The creator a former Mitt Romney guy said he wanted to humanize the right which makes sense The media perpetuates Republicans as old and evil as proxies for the old and evil parents who never hugged them But righties arent the only ones trying to change As elections loom Dems are morphing into Republicans firing more guns than Yosemite Sm and drilling like a Black  Decker BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ALISON LUNDERGAN GRIMES SENATE CANDIDATE Im not Barack Obama I disagree with him on guns coal and the EPA And Mitch thats not how you hold a gun SEN MARK BEGICH R ALASKA Im Mark Begich It took five years but I got the road approved Next year the oil search ph I approve this message because sooner or later Washington will figure out that I dont take no for an answer END VIDEO CLIP GUTFELD It is like a bio ph The fact is both the right and left suffer from stereotypical easily identifiable mannerisms For liberals youre a peacecrazed identity obsessed treehugging multipierced whiners See Matt Damon Janeane Garofalo Sean Penn Michael Moore Rosie ODonnell Lena Dunham and Madison Wisconsin For conservatives youre a white fundamentalist warloving fuel guzzling one percenter See Montgomery Burns But Mr Obama was able to take his own partys tired cliches and camouflage them with soaring rhetoric and it worked Its time now for the Republicans to do the same But this commercial is not the answer You shouldnt be saying were just like them You should be saying why youre better than them You need to focus on why youre right and you need to do so persuasively with wit and intelligence and passion If thats asking too much then you dont deserve to win You deserve to continue losing and drinking the blood of baby pandas GUILFOYLE Say you do not endorse that though GUTFELD Its tasty Dont knock it until youve tried it Its great for the skin Kimberly Does this commercial help or hurt the party or is it basically what they call a push GUILFOYLE OK Im going to say its a little bit of a push I like the idea of it but I think the musical score is not going to win any award nominations people I mean you could have had something very cool I like some of the imagery But again you also dont want to act like youre so weird that you have to try that hard GUTFELD Yes Its the trying that hard thing thats the problem And trying to be cool If you try to be cool you never can be You did not like this ad GUILFOYLE He loved it BECKEL This may be  Ive seen thousands of political ads and Ive done some bad ones myself but this is by far and away the worst I think Ive ever seen When you set and tell people Republicans are white Republicans are black Republicans are Hispanic Republicans are Asian Republicans read The New York Times in public Republicans use Macs Republicans are  heres this Republicans are grandmas daughters and moms And Republicans enjoy gourmet cooking Are you kidding me GUTFELD But you know why they do it Bob BECKEL Yes Tell me why they do it GUTFELD But they do it because the media has portrayed Republicans as anything but human so they have to try to portray themselves as human BECKEL Why dont they do something thats human GUTFELD What you mean create jobs GUILFOYLE Oh Bob you were actually funny up until that point GUTFELD Like protect the country BECKEL I dont think people perceive them as doing things that help people GUTFELD Why is that BECKEL I dont know GUTFELD I do Its called PERINO Why theyre about to win the midterms GUTFELD Eric PERINO I think that the next ad that the Mitt Romney guys should do is just do an ad and say all Democrats are like Bob Beckel And you can just throw Its Bob its Bob its Bob Because the name calling against Republicans has been outrageous for years GUTFELD Yes PERINO And I admire this because I understand  we are not their target audience OK Im not their target audience Ive been a Republican for a long time Im comfortable with it GUILFOYLE You should have been in the video PERINO I ignore that But the younger people theyre trying to appeal to a younger audience They want younger voters They have to compete I hand it to them for giving it a shot And you know what This ad might have been more effective with people who are younger We are old now GUTFELD Yes PERINO You realize that GUTFELD So I heard somebody say that it felt like a Viagra ad GUILFOYLE Who would say that Who would say something so provocative BECKEL Id like to see what a focus group with young people would be on this And I bet you it would be disastrous BOLLING Very quickly We dont have a lot of time but the ad seemed to me to say Republicans are like liberals Everything that they went through sounded like a liberal GUILFOYLE Right BOLLING The Prius The New York Times that kind of stuff I dont think we need to act more like liberals I think we need to act more like conservatives PERINO Look weve lost the last several presidential elections I think that weve got to try something Im for that Why not just try GUTFELD More tattoos Thats all that means More tattoos PERINO Thats true BECKEL Theres an old rule of thumb in politics

survivor Marcus Luttrell Hes now a dad of two including a 2yearold little girl and hes already issuing a warning to any little boys out there hoping to date her one day Now in a Facebook post that went viral Luttrell says hes going to make any suitors quote paint the house mend some fence cut the lawn rope a tornado bottle up a hurricane and put out a forest fire with a squirt gun Now that would be something you could earn a date And when he gets done then he says hes going to let them have his cell number so they can face time while he holds the phone So look forward to seeing the first candidate in about 16 years He is going to be waiting Luttrell explained why hes so protective of his daughter on FOX and Friends this weekend Take a listen BEGIN VIDEO CLIP MARCUS LUTTRELL FORMER NAVY SEAL The most important thing to me is the fact that I hope she finds somebody who loves her unconditionally and treats her as well and loves her as much as I love her mother Im not intimidated by anybody But one of the most frustrating things and intimidating things I ever had to do was when I asked for my wifes hand in marriage And its not because I was afraid I just didnt want to disappoint him And I never wanted to let him down on how I treated his daughter END VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE And he does love his wife He told me a story one time	Melanie his wife is amazing How when he first saw her he knew that that was the woman that he wanted to marry moved right on target So I understand his love is deep and very serious about his kids especially his daughter Now Bob you have a daughter BECKEL Yes GUILFOYLE What  do you do anything to like prevent guys from dating her BECKEL Not quite to that extreme but I can understand exactly where hes coming from Youve got a little girl and youre thinking about her going out dating And the first thing you think about at least in my case was what I was like to date and it was very dangerous I kept ph it very simple To the first guy she dated I said Look her curfew is at 12 GUILFOYLE Right BECKEL If shes back here at 1201 youre dead And then after youre dead your father is dead GUILFOYLE Oh my gosh BECKEL So he got her home ten minutes early But the one thing I love about what Luttrell said here is listen to this GUILFOYLE How you work BECKEL  there ought to be a chastity belt made with a sealed trident engraved on it and Ask  it reads Ask father for key GUILFOYLE I think he might be making one right now Bolling you have a son Eric Chase What do you think about dating You treat it different if its a son right BOLLING Yes I think you do You know Im sure theres never going to be a time where my son brings the girl home and says Dad is it OK if I date her Look hes got to go to her I get it Look there are  more parents should be like Marcus Luttrell I mean I listened to that on Sirius XM I think it was Saturday morning and it was fantastic It was like wow that is really really cool He said some things that may be considered a little not politically correct So what	Who cares If every father had that attitude I think kids would be in much better shape GUILFOYLE Yes And a lot of people watched it it went viral They forwarded it I think its very funny I love it because I lived this Dana with my father who was just like What time is the dance over And Id have to be home like 30 minutes before it ended Forget about it PERINO I always came 30 minutes  home 30 minutes before it ended BECKEL I bet you did GUILFOYLE You werent told to but you did it anyway Theres the difference between the two of us PERINO I think that what he was describing about the feelings for his daughter is what every father feels when they find out theyre going to have a daughter when the daughter is born if its a surprise So I think its a good thing GUILFOYLE I love it I love the passion and you know that shes going to be well guided you know by her parents Theyre on it PERINO Or shes going to be quite a rebellious person GUILFOYLE Were praying Yes Greg what do you have GUTFELD Well I dont worry  I dont worry much about the attitudes of fathers I worry about the expectations of modern girls Do they expect less from men these days in how they dress and how they act or the idea of being a gentleman dressing like a man having a mature behavior I get the impression that from my limited experience with a niece that weve had a relaxed formality in the name of progress Manners and respect should never go out of style but I feel that they have You should not honk your horn when youre picking up a date You go to the door You should not wear a baseball cap when you show up to meet the parents You should always be making eye contact I get the feeling that lately because the essence of cool has dictated that people can be more casual and more relaxed about their behavior its given women less  I dont know less elegant options in the world of men and thats a bit sad So I dont  I dont worry about the father I worry about the women BECKEL And its true too You look at the pool out there thats available These guys where their pants are falling down GUILFOYLE Right BECKEL Theyve got their baseball caps on sideways They stink They dont shave Theyre loudmouthed Its just unbelievable I mean I looked out there and I thought to myself my daughter has got to find a date in this crowd PERINO Yes And shes in Boulder Colorado BECKEL And shes in Boulder Colorado GUTFELD Wow PERINO Well Im just saying BECKEL Listen a lot of the AUDIO GAP GUILFOYLE Beep When The Five returns were going to have an update on the Ebola scare in America Should the US be closing our airports to travelers from infected countries to keep us safe Stay tuned COMMERCIAL BREAK BECKEL Ive got to be very careful here The US suspended flights to Israel this summer over missile fears So it begs the question should we be stopping flights from West Africa where countries are battling outbreaks of Ebola particularly since we had one that came into this country So the question is should we stop flights coming in from countries that have Ebola outbreaks Eric what do you think BOLLING I like the idea A couple of months ago when President Obama made his speech from the CDC he said one of the things were going to do is were going to talk to other governments and airports and make sure that someone doesnt get on a flight board a flight for the United States who has Ebola Clearly we cant stop that now And we know the numbers are somewhere around 13000 or 14000 Americans with American passports that are able  and who are in one of these three countries who could come back here and not even know they have Ebola Heres my point Should the feds mandate it Maybe not Should the airlines do it on their own Probably like British Airways did BECKEL Dana what do you think PERINO Well I think that we have to separate the two issues So when it came to the Israel Ben Gurion Airport when it was shut down that was because of the concern about missiles It was not  the Israeli government asked us not to do it but the United States government decided to do it anyway This is different in that you have a disease outbreak and it is so serious and severe with Ebola that I do think it merits the consideration to shut down those flights and surprised they havent done it before now BECKEL Are you surprised GUILFOYLE Yes I agree with Dana wholeheartedly This seems like a very easy obvious solution Why not err on the side of caution Why wouldnt you because the alternative is so grave So why wouldnt you do it so we can secure the situation If any Americans or people who are infected over there need to get here we certainly have the means and ability to be able to transport them like we did the two doctors that were infected and get the right tests done BECKEL I think that  I think thats GUILFOYLE Too much at stake BECKEL Whats your view of it GUTFELD Well thank you for asking GUILFOYLE Youre very welcome GUTFELD I love this new new thoughtful way were talking about this thing BECKEL Yes GUTFELD I believe this is a very serious issue and we must ignore insulting or offending people and ask about travel BECKEL We certainly should please GUTFELD And we should ask about their travel history and curtail travel when we have the opportunity to because the outbreak in Africa at this point is out of control And we need to contain that We need to contain that Im being serious PERINO I cant take your GUILFOYLE No you like it Its very Special Report GUTFELD We need to contain  we need to contain whats going on in Africa before  I think we have to stop traffic  travel at some point GUILFOYLE Shut it down GUTFELD And then when thats under control we open it And nobody should get their feelings hurt over this There should be no political correctness BECKEL You would be  you would be perfect in a professor lounge now the way youre dealing with this I think it was very smart All those comments were very smart I will say one other thing I dont think theres any way they know if people have Ebola when they get on planes BOLLING And that is the point GUILFOYLE Right BOLLING That whether you fill out the form or the card that says do you have Ebola or have you had contact with someone if you say no you may not know youve had contact PERINO May not even know exactly GUILFOYLE And he knew he did allegedly BOLLING Someone saying they dont have or had contact with Ebola CROSSTALK PERINO Especially to get out He knew he had contact with a pregnant woman who died Thats what I just said The point is allegedly he filled out the form and said that he hadnt had contact with anyone with Ebola	Maybe he didnt realize GUTFELD But he took her to the hospital where they said We dont have room in the Ebola room for her She died a few hours later and they brought her back BECKEL Im sorry to interrupt here because its something we have to do	Because One More Thing is up next GUILFOYLE Please COMMERCIAL BREAK BOLLING All right Back for One More Thing Dana is first PERINO OK So one of the biggest stories this week around the world is the protest in Hong Kong This is a show of amazing force of how many people are basically gathering They have been pretty peaceful That doesnt look peaceful But they actually have been fairly restrained	Theres tens of thousands of people protesting Chinas heavy hand in Hong Kong We should make sure that we pay attention to them and support the freedom fighters and people who want democracy over there BOLLING Very very good Agreed Bobby youre up BECKEL OK Michael Phelps is a man who won eight  I think it was seven or eight gold medals in one Olympics was stopped for drunk driving in Maryland He was  his blood alcohol level was 014 He was driving 85 miles an hour in a 45 mileanhour zone He failed sobriety tests Now Mike my boy youve got a lot of money You can afford to get yourself a car service to take you around And I have a pretty  my proposal on this is pretty simple If you get caught for drunk driving at that level you lose your license for one year The second time you lose it for three years And if you do it three times you go to jail for five years It ought to be a felony Because we lose tens of thousands of people to drunk drivers every year And thank God when I was drinking and driving I didnt kill anybody but I think about it all the time BOLLING All right Greg you are up GUTFELD All right On that note its time for BEGIN VIDEO CLIP GUTFELD Gregs Medical Tips END VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE Oh my gosh GUTFELD Well you know a lot of people ask me Greg how do I lose weight I say you dont have to A very simple way of appearing 20 pounds lighter is do what this little cat did Just jump into a little tub sit there for a little while and almost instantly you appear 20 pounds lighter He was once a fat cat but look how skinny he is now And because of this that cat is now a highly paid fashion model on every catwalk across the world PERINO Oh my gosh thats terrible Cats dont even like water GUTFELD How dare you Thats catist BOLLING All right KG youre up GUILFOYLE It probably is On a serious note Some of you might have been following the legal news today and we were awaiting the sentencing of course of Joe and Theresa Giudice Thats Italian pronunciation Unfortunately they both are going to go to jail For their kids this is a very sad situation But shes got 15 months This is for bank and mail and wire fraud and a host of other charges They ended up pleading guilty The judge is showing some leniency in allowing her to serve the time after the holidays She has to surrender January 5 and not until she gets  in case youre worrying about how this is going to work with the children he will serve time after that 41 months BOLLING Fortyone months for him as well OK So yesterday we talked about Mumia whos going to do the commencement speech at Goddard college Well all institutions of higher learning arent bad Check out this one Someone tweeted this to me Let me get his name His name is Jeff T JTGreat88 Tweeted that Look a college course at Vincennes University in Indiana watching The Five PERINO Wow They must be learning a lot Their parents will be thrilled BOLLING Im thrilled PERINO If had you had to write a report could you please send it to us so that we can get some viewer feedback BOLLING If youre in a college classroom and you do watch The Five as part of your curriculum let us know Send me a picture on Facebook GUILFOYLE Or post it on The Five page BOLLING Weve got to go

copyright or other notice from copies of the content    ERIC BOLLING COHOST Hello everyone Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle Bob Beckel Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld its 5 oclock in New York City and this is The Five All right in a moment youre gonna hear some fascinating sound from a Muslim who says he attended the same mosque where the Oklahoma beheading suspect practiced Islam What he says goes on in private in that mosque will shock you Plus this BEGIUN VIDEO CLIP NOOR The teaching that Islam allows three choices to be made in nonMuslims and eventually theyre all going to have to make that choice to convert to live under Islamic rule or die END OF VIDEO CLIP BOLLING As President Bush predicted wed be forced to confront an enemy far greater than Al Qaeda if we left Iraq too soon He was right today He spoke to Fox News for the very first time about that ominous warning and the state of Iraq today BEGIN VIDEO CLIP KILMEADE You knew it in 2007 In fact this is George Bush President George Bush in 2007 before the surge GEORGE W BUSH FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Begin withdrawing before our commanders tell us were ready would be dangerous	It means that wed be risking mass killings on a horrific scale It means increasing the probability that American troops would have to return at some later date to confront an enemy that is even more dangerous KILMEADE How did you know BUSH Well I know the nature of the enemy Anybody who kills 3000 innocents and beheads people because of their religion or because of their point of view is dangerous Democracy takes time to take hold and yet theres impatience with that process in the Americans Americans have got to understand that the lesson of 911 is still important today as it was right after 911 END OF VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Also what is he think about President Obamas decision to pull our troops out and let terrorists take over the country Heres more from 43 BEGIN VIDEO CLIP KILMEADE Martin Dempsey came out as chairman of joint his status says well known the military recommended and we leave a residual force of 10000 to 15000 maybe more Did you feel the same way BUSH I did yeah I agreed with General Dempseys assessment END OF VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Alright Bob Well open it to you because we have a lot of sound from President Bush Your thoughts on the  really the first comments since he really predicted what was going on now back in 2007 BOB BECKEL COHOST You have to understand where Im coming from I dont think any of this would have happened if we hadnt gone to war in Iraq Saddam Hussein had done a lot of things that were bad but not nearly as bad as these guys He was being contained there was a no fly zone the Kurds were being protected More importantly he kept the Iranians in check When the administration went on that I assume they believe were accurate stories about weapons of mass destruction Colin Powell called his performance at the UN The most embarrassing thing hed ever done in his public life when he was forced to give testimony to the UN about why there were weapons of mass destruction The question really is could 10000 or 15000 people have been there and for how long 10 20 30 40 years and would that really have stopped this Youre talking about secretary on violence it was back over 2000 years I think it was a bad decision to go in The end product of it is were seeing it today BOLLING Maybe the bad decision was to pull out too soon and as we pointed out George Bush predicted that if we had let pulled out if we let the residual force in Iraq maybe we wouldnt have Americans beheaded on tape DANA PERINO COHOST So if you read Thomas Joscelyn of the Weekly Standard who writes about the enemy and the nature of the enemy as President Bush was describing But the grand plan was to build out from Afghanistan Al Qaeda And now you have all these other groups that have metastasized that are being called different names but the truth is it is all Al Qaeda Theres a  theres of two things basically what President Bush is saying when he agrees with General Dempsey its no different than what Secretary Gates Secretary Clinton Secretary Panetta and General Petraeus have all said the first three of those all in books so theyre on record saying that they disagree with the presidents decision to leave Iraq at the time  or not to leave more of a force there Bob that is true I dont know why youre breathing heavy but thats true CROSSTALK BECKEL Im not breathing Im listening to you PERINO that cabinet secretary BOLLING You know he breathes heavy all the time PERINO I know you can see from my point of view hes always like breathing deep Those are facts The only people who seem to think that was not a good idea were Obama Biden and Susan Rice Now thats their prerogative and  but there are consequences for decisions as youre seeing The second thing I wanted to mention is we cut the sound bite a little bit too early because I liked the second part of what President Bush said In regards to lesson after 911 is that Americans need to understand the west needs to understand that the human condition around the world matters And it matters to our national security That is the broader foreign policy thinking of the Bush administration I think its also important he  the president didnt give an interview to Brian Kilmeade today to talk about this per se of course he knew he would be asked about it I guess But the purpose of inviting them down there was to talk about the fourth annual 2015 warrior open that is a big golf tournament that supports Iraqi and Afghanistan war veterans BOLLING Let me bring these guys in We have a lot more sound to get to Thoughts on that first interview after  GREG GUTFELD COHOST To Bobs point we have placed troops in countries for decades after wars so its something that we do to maintain the peace and sometimes it lasts a long time That war had been won but it wasnt Obamas war to win so it was ours to lose It was like President Obama had moved into a new apartment and somebody had left the shower curtain behind but that wasnt his shower curtain so he just got rid of it Thats what he did with the Iraq war BOLLING KG your thoughts let me get on KG on this one because we got another piece of sound from Bush go ahead KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE COHOST I just take issue with taking that shot at President Bush and trying to despair a chance ph where hes been nothing but a gentleman and a class act been unbelievably respectful and empathetic to the difficult job that President Obama had BOLLING Stay right there CROSSTALK BOLLING Bob hold on thats a great transition to the next one What does President Bush think of President Obama allowing ISIS to rise in Iraq	Listen BEGIN VIDEO CLIP BUSH The president has to make the choices he thinks are important Im not going to second guess our president I understand how tough the job is	And to have a former president you know bloviating and secondguessing is I dont think good for the presidency or the country KILMEADE Does President Obama call you BUSH Well he called me to tell me that the nation killed Osama bin Laden are the inaudible and the law enforcer are grateful But now hes been  you know hes not on a regular basis which is OK It doesnt hurt my feelings Its a decision he has made END OF VIDEO CLIP BOLLING I want to get to Dana in a second but go ahead GUILFOYLE Well he goes on to say that he understands President Obama has developed a relationship over six years with people that he trust and that seeks counsel in so this is the bigger man Im saying you know what I dont mind if he needs me Im here But the point is theres always lessons to be learned from history and past presidents have had a history of in fact contacting their predecessors Because there was something to be cleaned and learned from that being the one person on opposition to power And with respect to President Bush you didnt see him take a shot and say told you so I was right about this We should have done  we should have finished the job by allowing the Iraqi people to have the benefit of ongoing support so that we could have not made what the veterans fought for in vain by seeing intensified by them BECKEL Just out of curiosity what former presidents consulted other presidents for big decisions BOLLING He did BECKEL For what BOLLING Bill Clinton said that Bush called him GUILFOYLE Called him BECKEL Yeah BOLLING Theres one GUILFOYLE Twice a year and BECKEL Talking about bringing them is generally presidents dont GUILFOYLE For different with Nixon Yeah I mean theres a history of it CROSSTALK PERINO The reason behind with that Bob is because in the Wall Street Journal there was a very important column by Bret Stephens on Tuesday in which it suggested that President Obama could benefit from a call from  with President Bush or having a more of a relationship while talking to him But that is based on reports from mostly from Bill Clinton but President Bush is comment on  commented on it as well that Bush and Clinton developed a good working relationship and a friendship and camaraderie during the Bush administration GUILFOYLE That continues to this day PERINO Yeah GUTFELD The bottom line is President Obama took the surge personally because he was against us and punished us nationally because of a petulant adolescent reaction to something that proved him incorrect BECKEL Can you explain to me what you said this over and over again This war was won How do you mean it was GUTFELD The surge The surge  was the surge a failure PERINO The surge worked GUTFELD There was a vote There was democracy there was calm There was a surge and then it all went to hell BECKEL What about corruption GUTFELD Corruption is around in every start of every country we know that CROSSTALK BECKEL But if corruption in our country now GUILFOYLE But because the men and women that served the country valiantly felt that they had achieved the goal and everybody who was there that was on the ground knew that we need to keep the position strong so that they could continue to succeed otherwise its like pulling the sheet out from under them BOLLING Lets bring this to the today and now to terror right here at home There was a Jihadstyle beheading here in America a few days ago and the administration can still only call it workplace violence But listen closely to a man Megyn Kelly spoke to last night He says he attended the same mosque where the Oklahoma suspect worshipped we could roll it there and the terror was taught there BEGIN VIDEO CLIP NOOR To the public the mosque will not promote terrorism or any kind of radical acts but when theyre among friends and congregants only they will promote the true teachings of Islam which include the offer to non Muslims the choice rather that you must convert live under Islamic rule or be fought against Jihad Fisabilillah Jihad for the sake of Allah END OF VIDEO CLIP BOLLING And the Oklahoma mass was similar ph was also exposes the congregations true feelings about bin Laden and those horrific beheadings BEGIN VIDEO CLIP NOOR I had two friends at the mosque One of them is now an Imam The men told me that if Osama bin Laden came to their door they would invite him in and protect him because he was a brother Muslim and we must protect him for those who dont believe MEGYN KELLY THE KELLY FILE HOST Did they ever discuss the subject of beheadings Was that ever discussed NOOR The only time that beheadings were discussed was in the means at which you confront the infidel as this is related into Quran That when you meet the unbelievers you should smile at their necks END OF VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Alright Greg so now if you need more proof of terrorize GUTFELD Yeah But we didnt even need to hear it from him If this victim was already dead which I think she was why did he behead her Because what would be the point The point is was to spread terror to send a message and that makes it terror So why dont we just compromise and call it workplace terror Just get rid of the violence Well lets all agree one spot and say it happened at the workplace its terror By the way were so focused on his actions but in hate crimes were always focused on intent Why is it with this action  with this crime its all about the action and not the intent The opposite will hate crimes BECKEL You know son the thing about this is and Ive been saying this for a long time I got beat up by saying you should no more mosques A lot of this stuff is going on a lot of mosques They raise money for terrorists they  some not all of them but a lot of them preach a brand of Islam that is not acceptable I think in mainstream is long But you know this is not new to me this is you know we were pulled back and	inaudible I dont think we should have and that theyre training a lot of people GUTFELD But I dont think you can say all mosques BECKEL No I didnt do that I said some of them GUILFOYLE No I mean look this is again you know further evidence and further proof and to pick up on more of what youre talking about yeah why wouldnt we take him at his words that describe so in  his intent	What his actions were combine with what was in his mind and his ideology about committing Jihad a symbolic then if in fact she was deceased to cut her head off I mean thats exactly what he was trying to achieve in that moment Take him for his word and his actions PERINO One of the things I really liked about seeing that and appreciating the interview is that right before it they talked  they had a reporter out there who was saying  to the mosque representative you were about  you said you would talk to us and all of a sudden you changed your mind	The reason that interview I think is important is that you have very little communication coming out of the mosque Thats why there has been the need to do some sort of surveillance at times that they think was a specific threat GUILFOYLE An infiltration PERINO Yeah that was on the merits GUILFOYLE Yeah PERINO So this information that we get firsthand from somebody that was actually there and then goes back that he reveals last night on in that interview because of a law enforcement request is very interesting Shes going to have a second part tonight I dont know if she asked but Im kinda  Im curious about this question What led him to the mosque in the first place What was it that he was BECKEL This guy CROSSTALK PERINO What was he looking for I think that would give us even a different picture GUILFOYLE And did he come in contact with someone who specifically kind of encouraged him or put the idea in his head Because its all about them inspiring and reaching out and trying further the tentacles of terror BOLLING And  you know I mean obviously I mean I know the answer to this question but why do you have to be in silhouette You have to be in silhouette because if youre a whistleblower in a mosque about Islam youre likely going to be the next one beheaded or at least threatened GUILFOYLE Youre DOA BOLLING Unfortunately I think about all the other whistleblowers that are on TV They talk about you know exposing corruption in the government or exposing corruption in a business or a company or what now But if you expose corruption or terrorism in a mosque youre likely risking your life for it CROSSTALK GUTFELD Either that or had a bad hair day BOLLING That too GUILFOYLE It looks like he was wearing a cap GUTFELD Yeah BOLLING Should we go LAUGHTER	Well go Alright before we go a programming note dont miss Gretas big interviews tonight with the prime minister of Israel tonight PVnet and Yahoo warns about the dire threat of global Jihad Heres a peek BEGIN VIDEO CLIP NETANYAHU The problem is that militant Islam is trying to dominate the Middle East and then take over the world Its number one target ultimately is the United States They view all these branches shiites radical shiites radical sunnis they see you as the great state They call us the small state because were just a frontal position a forward position of the United States They want to destroy us so they can get to you END OF VIDEO CLIP BOLLING Thats 700 pm Eastern tonight Then coming up instead of focusing on the Jihad crisis our president is focusing today on helping his party win their election Dana is all over that here on The Five PERINO So is America better off than it was six years ago More than half the country says no according to a recent Fox poll and that includes 37 percent of Democrats With the midterms fast approaching the president is trying to convince voters otherwise at least when it comes to the economy	He spoke today BEGIN VIDEO CLIP BARRACK OBAMA PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA We can and should be proud of the progress that our country has made over these past six years It is indisputable that our economy is stronger today than when I took office I said we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation for growth and prosperity and with dedicated persistent effort weve actually been laying the cornerstones of this foundation every single day since END OF VIDEO CLIP PERINNO OK So Eric let me start with you our financial expert Is it not true that you are  in every recession the country does better six years later The question is the relevancy  or I mean how relative it is to growth and how its potential BOLLING The most important thing is growth and how soon do you get back to normal growth It took us six years and we may not be there Heres the point though President Obama today used those words he wrote part of that sound by it says Its indisputable and then went on to say by every economic measure America is better off He said they is  lets deal in facts Mr President I listened to your speech Ill deal in facts if you want These are apples to apples comparisons from the day he took over to today Median household income is down thats a fact Household ownership rate is down thats a fact Gasoline prices are up Way up thats a fact	Milk prices are at an alltime high Up way up And the last one number of Americans receiving food stamps is way way up We know the numbers about labor participation force  a participation rate is down PERINO Went down BOLLING I mean I can name 20 different facts that are disputable that America is better off BECKEL How about  how about some of these facts BOLLING All Im saying is that hes said Lets sure in facts say its indisputable and by CROSSTALK BECKEL Is it ever  2008 that this country be better off on this day then 	BOLLING I just gave you 5 minutes BECKEL Youre in a whole close to it did fresh BOLLING Hows this Go to our Facebook The Five fan Facebook page whatever it is right now Facebookcom and Ill put all the facts up for it that show that were not better off BECKEL Do you mind if I share a few facts too the number of jobs have grown from 215000 that a faster pace since 1999 Theres been no inflation The stock market is up Profits are up in the  across the board Still the wages on  GUTFELD Wait a second I thought you would hate that PERONO Yeah right GUILFOYLE Bob said GUTFELD I thought you would hate  profits PERINO Whoa GUTFELD You just had a 400000 person march against profits BECKEL Who is Louise ph CROSSTALK GUTFELD You know he wants to say the economy is on an upward trajectory	So were North Korean missile tests Its never happened Hes making middle class households poorer If being  making people poor is progress he is a progressive Its incredible I just dont get it Bob when you say youre for profits one day and then youre not the previous BECKEL I am always been for profits Im not against profits I understand GUILFOYLE I wanna flag on the play BECKEL I know profits are necessary for growth Im not a communist despite what you may think GUTFELD You have admitted to being a communist BECKEL Well I said that in jest GUILFOYLE Not this week CROSSTALK BECKEL The point is that he has got the right political thing to do is to move to the economy Hes got some things he can talk about a thing he can brag about and thats what the democrats need PERINO What I think theyre missing and Im curious where it is maybe Kimberly well get you in on this which is the bigger idea So lets give	 lets stipulate that OK So we were in a financial crisis and a panic in the fall of 2008 The president takes over Six years later the country still  there Im saying the polling says that they dont feel like its good enough GUILFOYLE Yeah PERINO So where is the big idea I mean see the minimum wage piece But other than that what is the president talking about I didnt see anything else that was new today GUILFOYLE No of course not but this is the only the material that he has to work with Somebody is like here are the cue cards these are the things we can hit you have to pivot to the economy Its a very you know typical Obama policy speech growth for this many numbers of quarters hes such a  hes got to seize on what he can right Because midterms are coming up so this is a point of crisis He has to go for what at least he can have something positive to say The problem is the public the American people the voters arent buying it so theres a disconnection So hes just hoping that perception is reality if he says it enough BECKEL Can somebody please give us exactly question was that CROSSTALK GUILFOYLE Well here  just so you know the Fox News poll of the 911 BECKEL Yeah you know the question the exact question was that GUILFOYLE Voters dont agree with the presidents assessment that the country is better off They dismiss the presidents boast as mostly false by a 58 to 36 percent margin That includes 37 percent of the senate Democrats BECKEL Thats right Thats what I thought the question It was not about their own economic situation PERINO But Bob the president is the one who in 60 minutes hes the who asked  who posed the question that way Actually we were just quoting the president in that question CROSSTALK PERINO I want to roll this because the president took a little bit of personal shot at this network today in a speech Take a look BEGIN VIDEO CLIP OBAMA Theres a reason fewer republicans you hear them running around about Obamacare Because while good affordable health care might seem like a fanged

WALLACE A doctor in New York is the latest case as two Dallas nurses are declared Ebolafree NINA PHAM DALLAS NURSE Im on my way back to recovery even as I reflect on how many others have not been so fortunate WALLACE Well get the latest developments and well talk with one of the governments point men leading the fight against Ebola Dr Anthony Fauci And Chris Christie hits the campaign trail for GOP candidates across the country Well ask the governor how he thinks Republicans will do in 2014 and whether he will run for president in 2016 Chris Christie its a Fox News exclusive Plus two attacks in Canada and a violent assault against police in New York stoke fears of lone wolf terrorism JOSH EARNEST WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY ISIL has demonstrated a capacity to use social media and other aspects of modern technology to try to radicalize citizens from countries WALLACE Our Sunday group weighs in All right now on Fox News Sunday END VIDEOTAPE WALLACE And hello again from Fox News in Washington Three states  New York New Jersey and Illinois  have now ordered mandatory quarantine from travelers from West Africa who that direct with Ebola patients This after New York City doctor just back from the hot zone tested positive for the virus In a few minutes well with Governor Chris Christie about New Jerseys policy in his first Sunday show interview this year But first Fox NEWS senior correspondent Rick Leventhal is outside Bellevue Hospital in New York with the latest on that doctor and the response  Rick RICK LEVENTHAL FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT Chris Dr Craig Spencers condition has worsened somewhat as expected since he arrived at Bellevue New Yorks first Ebola patient now has gastrointestinal symptoms Hes receiving plasma and antiviral therapy and hes awake and communicating and will stay in isolation His fiancee was sent home but will remain under quarantine for 21 days as of two friends of the doctor none have symptoms But officials want to ensure they dont have the virus City leaders have been working overtime to reassure New Yorkers theyre safe after learning Dr Spencer road subways visited a park ate at restaurants and went bowling in Brooklyn the night before he developed a fever and was rushed to the hospital Since then The Gutter bowling alley was entirely sanitized including holes of the balls and has been declared safe And New York City had a meal at the meatball shop where Dr Spencer to dispel fears Meanwhile a nurse who landed at Newark Friday after treating Ebola patients in West Africa was placed in quarantine even though she had no symptoms BEGIN VIDEO CLIP BILL DE BLASIO NEW YORK CITY MAYOR The state has a right to make its decisions like the CDC does and were going to work with them This is not about personalities This is not about personal opinions This is a crisis in which everyone works together So I dont think its about what we think personally Its about what is going to keep our people safe END VIDEO CLIP LEVENTHAL There is no Ebola vaccine but there could have been One was developed in Canada ten years ago and proven 100 percent effective in monkeys but it was shelved because of a lack of interest Its now in critical trials and could ready next year  Chris WALLACE Rick Leventhal reporting from New York  Rick thanks for that Now lets bring in Dr Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases And Dr Fauci this is becoming a weekly occurrence Welcome back DR ANTHONY FAUCI NIAID Thank you Good to be with you WALLACE As we mentioned the governors of New York and New Jersey have instituted this mandatory quarantine for all people coming back from West Africa through their airports who got direct contact with Ebola patients including all medical workers Here is Chris Christie announcing it BEGIN VIDEO CLIP GOV CHRIS CHRISTIE RNJ New Jersey and New York are going to determine standards of quarantine since CDCs guidance is continually changing And we need to set a standard for our two states END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE Given that people are not contagious until they show symptoms Does it  is it good science to quarantine them for 21 days FAUCI OK First principle protect the American people Second principle make a decision based on the science Right now as we said many times people without symptoms do not transmit Ebola We know that So guidelines regarding how you handle people from coming back should always be based on the science And science tells us that people who are asymptomatic do not transmit That doesnt mean were cavalier about it but that means there are other steps to protect American people based on scientific evidence that does not necessarily have to go so far as to possibly have unintended consequences of disincentivizing health care workers The best way to protect us is to stop the epidemic in Africa and we need those health care workers So we do not want to put them in a position where it makes it very very uncomfortable for them to even volunteer to go CROSSTALK WALLACE I want to press on this though So youre saying that this mandatory 21day quarantine especially for people who are completely asymptomatic is not good science FAUCI Well if youre talking about an asymptomatic person theres a way to monitor them You can do it by active and direct monitoring that would accomplish the same thing The difficulty when you put someone into position is that if youre going to go over there when you come back no matter what you do  no symptoms youre not at high risk you still have 21 days out of your life where you cant move I think well have unintended negative consequences WALLACE So youre against the 21day quarantine FAUCI Personally myself as a physician scientist I would not have recommended that WALLACE But and I know a lot of listeners are going to say lets look at the case of this doctor Craig Spencer he started feeling sluggish on Tuesday Hes running around the city Hes on subways Hes at the bowling alley and he does all of this before he  you know is  reports in and is taken to the hospital Can you trust people Heres a doctor Can you trust them to self monitor FAUCI Well in general  I mean the human nature everyone is the same that you trust What you can do to get that extra step is to ratchet up the monitoring from passive to what we call active or direct where someone actually each day would take the temperature get a symptom story and then make a decision whether someone can go out But Dr Spencer did exactly what he should have done When he got back Medecins Sans Frontieres Doctors Without Borders say report your symptoms He did As soon as he got a fever he put himself in isolation WALLACE He was sluggish and he was running around town FAUCI He did not have symptoms No one came into contact with his body fluid Therefore the risk is essentially zero vanishingly small WALLACE You talk about what you seem to think is the lack of scientific wisdom in the decision to impose a 21day quarantine Youre the point man for the government on infectious disease Did anyone from Governor Christies office Governors Cuomos office contact you or to the best of your knowledge the CDC before they imposed this quarantine FAUCI The CDC was all over this The CDC set some minimum types of requirements that are good below ph which you cant go The states have authority to go beyond CDC recommendations which is what in this case they did But CDC immediately was involved in trying to make sure Americans are protected WALLACE I want to get back to your main concern here because youve said to me repeatedly  youve been on the show a lot in the last month  and you said repeatedly that the big concern and were not going to solve this crisis until we stop Ebola in West Africa How concerned are you And perhaps youre in contact with public health workers kind of people volunteering to go every off there FAUCI Right WALLACE How concerned are you if they know Im going over Im going to put myself in jeopardy and then when I come back I face mandatory threeweek quarantine out of my life unable to move around unable to go back to my job  how concerned are that thats going to stop people from going in the first place FAUCI I am concerned Chris because these people that Ive spoken to who are going there and coming back are concerned about that Theyre responsible They know that if in fact they have symptoms and have the possibility of transmitting it that they dont want to get anyone else infected But the idea of saying everybody even people without symptoms that really could be disincentive And its just an unintended consequence If we dont have our people volunteering to go over there then youre going to have other countries that are not going to do it and then the epidemic will continue to roar WALLACE Couple of quick questions you released the Dallas nurse Nina Pham who had Ebola She was  you were treating her There shes being released late this week from NIH when she was free of Ebola virus Have you determined how she got the virus Was it a problem with the CDC protocols And if so have you tightened those up FAUCI Well first of all you never can tell exactly how she got it because she was under one protocol for a few days and then the other So whatever it was she certainly was at a risk and got infected So whenever you see that Chris you try and tighten things up Right now the CDC protocols are much tighter than they were Those are protocols that actually worked very well historically in Africa We find now that with the intensive care setting that we have given this country they may not be optimal enough and thats why CDC has changed them Finally there was a story in The New York Times Rick Leventhal referred to it at the end of his report that scientists have come up with a vaccine a decade ago that was 100 percent effective in stopping Ebola in monkeys And because of the fact the disease was so rare there was not a market or incentive to test and to develop it Question  is there some way  first of all do you think we could have had had there about a full speed effort 10 years ago could we have had an Ebola vaccine by now And secondly if theres some way when there is so little market for it that we can get these things developed just in case we get into this kind of situation FAUCI OK answer to both questions Certainly without pharmaceutical backing youre not going to get a vaccine for sure We could have had one now You cant predict because the scientific issues there We may not scientifically have been able to do it But what the government is doing now through a program called BARDA the Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority is to be able to finance things where you can stockpile So the government is realizing that even if there isnt the need out there now there may be a need in the future And thats what that agency is doing WALLACE How close are we to a vaccine FAUCI Well again I cant predict I can tell you were moving along I told you last week were in phase one Were going to finish that in November Then were going to go into much larger trial in West Africa likely in Liberia and Monrovia to determine if it works Thats when we need to make sure that it works because you dont want to distribute a vaccine that could be harmful or not work The sooner we prove its worked the sooner we can distribute it widely WALLACE Dr Fauci thank you Thanks again for coming in and updating us again on the situation FAUCI Good to be with you Chris WALLACE Up next New Jersey Governor Chris Christie joins us for his first Sunday show interview of 2014 Well ask him about the new quarantine order how Republicans will do in the midterms and whether hell run for president in 2016 Well be right back with all of that COMMERCIAL BREAK WALLACE New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is traveling the country as head of the Republican Governors Association trying to elect GOP candidates this year and perhaps set the stage for a potential 2016 run for the White House Governor Christie joins us now from Florida where theres a tight governors race for his first Sunday show interview in 2014 Governor welcome to Fox News Sunday GOV CHRIS CHRISTIE RNJ Good morning Chris Good to be with you WALLACE Governor you just heard and we want to talk  before politics to this whole controversy about Ebola and quarantine you just heard Dr Fauci New York Citys health commissioner Dr Mary Bassett says reportedly she was furious that she was not informed before the quarantine was imposed Do you no longer trust the CDC and doctors and scientists CHRISTIE Well no thats pretty general statement Chris Of course we do The fact of the matter is CDC protocols as Dr Fauci admitted himself has been moving target and imagine that youre the person in charge of public health of people of largely densely populated state in fact most densely populated state in the Union and these protocols continue to move and change It was my conclusion we need to do this to protect the public health of people of New Jersey Governor Cuomo agreed And now Mayor Emanuel agrees And I think the CDC eventually will come around to our point of view on this WALLACE And what about Dr Fauci who says its not good science to quarantine people when theyre not symptomatic because they cant spread the disease in those situations CHRISTIE Well listen I have great respect for Dr Fauci But what hes counting on is voluntary system with folks who may or may not comply We had the situation in New Jersey Chris as you know with NBC News crew that said that they were going to selfquarantine and then two days later they were picking up takeout in Princeton and walking a around the streets of Princeton I mean the fact of the matter is that we  I dont believe when youre dealing with something as serious as this that we can count on a voluntary system This is governments job If anything else the government job is to protect safety and health of our citizens And so weve taken this action and I absolutely have no second thoughts about it WALLACE Well let me ask you about one other aspect of it Dr Fauci talks about the unintended consequence Everyone agrees that the only way youre going to stop this crisis is to end Ebola in West Africa and the concern is that the medical workers the doctors the nurses that are willing to take their chances and go over there when they hear now that theyre going to have to undergo mandatory three week quarantine when they come back may decide not to go in the first place and in fact the first nurse who has gone through the quarantine in New Jersey says that she feels she was badly treated So are you concerned that youre going to disincentivize people from going over there to help stop the outbreak CHRISTIE No Im really not Chris because I believe that folks who want to take that step and are willing to volunteer also understand that its in their interest and the public health interest to have a 21day period thereafter if theyve been directed expose to people with the virus And as we saw with what happened with some of the health care workers in Texas with the CDC shifting protocols we have people who are infected from that type of contact And we just cant have that in the New York and New Jersey area And thats why Governor Cuomo and I agree on this and now you see that they agree in Chicago as well I think this is a policy that will become a national policy sooner rather than later WALLACE All right Lets talk some politics Youre in Florida as head of Republican Governors Association Lets put up the numbers on the governors races At this point Republicans currently have 29 governor seats Democrats 21 But this year Republicans are defending 22 governorships and Democrats only 14 Governor where do you see the count  its now 2921 Republican  where do you see the count after the election CHRISTIE Well Chris its interesting You know were also defending nine governorships in states that President Obama has won twice And so we have a pretty daunting task on our hands And I think everybody expected us to be a little bit on our heels Its now quite to the contrary were on offense in more states than were on defense But the fact is that we have 12 races now within the margin of error with nine days to go until election So I think no one with really predict exactly where were going to be And Ive been more involved in these races than anyone on our side of the aisle But the fact is its going to be a real battle all the way down to Election Day Because of the great job that our Republican governors have done and some of the real good things that our candidates are proposing in challenger races I think were going to come through this very very well WALLACE Let me ask you briefly about Wisconsin where some of the people around Republican Governor Scott Walker who is seeking reelection are complaining that the RGA is not doing enough to support him and theyre even suggesting maybe the reason is because you view him as possible threat a possible contender for presidency in 2016 Your response sir CHRISTIE Well listen The facts just dont back that up Chris First of all Scott Walker and I have a great personal relationship I just spoke to Scott again a couple of days ago and we have a great personal relationship and Ill be going next week to campaign for him two different times Secondly we spent over 6 million already in state of Wisconsin on this effort And over the course of Scotts three races for governor 2010 2012 and 2014 we spent 20 million And so you know thats just folks who are in the punditry who want to you know talk about backroom kind of stuff that has no relationship to reality I am a complete Scott Walker supporter always have been and were going to work as hard as we can to make sure hes reelected and I believe he will be reelected on November 4th WALLACE Governor you mentioned President Obama While hes staying away from Democratic Senate races hes actually campaigning in several governor races In fact in these final days hes going to Pennsylvania Wisconsin Maine and Michigan Is it harder to tie a Democrat gubernatorial candidate in state race to President Obama and his policy CHRISTIE It depends who that Democrat is obviously Chris and what their record is For instance in Michigan Congressman Gary Schauer completely supports the Obama agenda and thats why Rick Snyder I believe on top of the fact that he has extraordinary record of job creation and growth and bringing Detroit back in Michigan will be elected Contributing factor of course is Congressman Schauers record of supporting the Obama agenda in Congress So it very much depends on who that Democratic candidate is But what we rely upon more than anything else are the great records and the great ideas of our Republican records and our Republican challengers You look at someone like Charlie Baker in Massachusetts hes running an outstanding race there Weve got a lot of great challenges around the country Bruce Rauner in Illinois is doing a great job in that very blue state Tom Foley in Connecticut is doing a great job in that very blue state And keep an eye on Larry Hogan down in Maryland also doing a good job in a very blue state Those are places that were pushing Chris and we may have success on election night WALLACE Governor I dont to tell you this is the first time that youve done a Sunday show since Bridgegate the scandal about the closing of those lanes from Fort Lee New Jersey onto the George Washington Bridge causing tremendous traffic jam because of the fact that the mayor of Fort Lee refused to support your reelection There was a report in September last month that nine months into their investigation that federal prosecutors had found no evidence that had you prior knowledge of lane closures and yet now more than a month later 10 months into investigation the state and federal investigations continue Question why do you think its taking so long CHRISTIE You know Chris I did this for seven years of my career Before I became governor I was United States attorney for the district of New Jersey And one thing I learned very clearly is that any time that politicians try to guess what was going on in prosecutors offices theyre making a big mistake So I dont speculate about that stuff All the people of New Jersey know and need to know is that I absolutely had nothing to do with this and that seems to be the conclusion that some folks are coming to as well and I know it will be the conclusion ultimately also because I know the truth WALLACE Well you talk about prosecutors Thats the federal case The state case is being handled by state legislators Do you think theres an effort by some of the Democrats there to keep you under a cloud CHRISTIE Of course of course And if you look at what those hearings have been like theyve been hyperpartisan and political But thats OK Chris You dont get me complaining about these things The fact of the matter of this we took steps we needed to take when we discovered that something in administration gone wrong And now we move on and we continue to govern and gotten things like bail reform done in New Jersey over the last number of months got a balanced budget passed again and did all the things that you expect the government to be doing working with Democrats who do not want to hyperpartisan and political So this is not the kind of stuff that concerns me at all I keep doing my job and doing my job at chairman of Republican Governors Association WALLACE I dont want to go too deeply into it but you brought up the budget Youre taking some criticism now for the financial situation in New Jersey You decided to cut payments to pension funds and instead of raising taxes on millionaires and businesses The credit rating for New Jersey has actually been downgraded eight times on your watch and the polls in New Jersey show you with your lowest favorability rating since you became governor Whats going on CHRISTIE Well first of all Chris you have to remember what we inherited five years ago  an 11 billion deficit budget 10 years of consecutive tax increases at the state level This was an awful mess And now what have we done We have five balanced budgets in a row We had 23 billion in tax cuts to the businesses of New Jersey 143000 new private sector jobs and unemployment rate thats gone from 97 percent down to 65 percent So we still have work to do in New Jersey no question But weve gotten a lot of things done over the course of the last five years Im very proud of that record and Im working every day to make that record even better as go forward So there will always be the naysayers Chris There will always be the critics But Im there getting the job done every day and I think thats what the people of New Jersey liked about us WALLACE All right Lets turn to 2016 Are you going to run for president CHRISTIE I dont know I have not made up my mind wont make up my mind until the beginning of next year Ive got 36 governor races Im overseeing right now in addition to a pretty busy day job as you outlined with the questions on Ebola and the budget and others And so I have not made a decision Chris But Im not being coy about it Im obviously thinking about it But I wont make any final decision until next year WALLACE You spoke to US Chamber of Commerce this week and you made some comments that got some attention Take a look BEGIN VIDEO CLIP CHRISTIE I am convinced that the next president of the United States is going to be a governor and it needs to be We had the experiment of a legislator whos never run anything getting onthe job training in the White House It has not been pretty END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE You were obviously taking a shot at President Obama but were you also taking a shot at potential candidates Rand Paul and Ted Cruz CHRISTIE No what I was talking about is what weve seen in the White House over the last six years And I think we see it over and over again with crisis that are happening both around the world and at home right now You need to have someone in that chair who knows how to make these decisions who have done it before and thats why I advocate governors as the best people to be considered for president in 2016 But no this is direct commentary on record of last six years and unfortunately the fact someone who never ran anything bigger than a Senate staff may not be the best training in the world to run the biggest government in the world Chris WALLACE In that Chamber of Commerce speech you also said quote Its time to start offending people And theres one comment you made that a lot of people are taking offense to Here it is BEGIN VIDEO CLIP CHRISTIE Im tired of hearing about minimum wage I really am I dont think theres a mother or father sitting around a kitchen table tonight in America who are saying You know honey if our son or daughter could just make a higher minimum wage my God all our dreams would be realized END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE Governor while everyone agrees that we need better paying jobs you know for people who are making 725 an hour the minimum wage now they say getting increase of 10 an hour would make a big difference in their lives and that you were being cavalier about it CHRISTIE Not being cavalier at all Chris Im saying it exactly as I see it What we need to do in this country is not have debate over a higher minimum wage We have to have a debate over creating betterpaying middle class jobs in the country If that somehow doesnt comport with what people in the political elite want well Im sorry But I know talking to families across New Jersey and now across this country that what theyre aspiring to is that good paying middle class jobs for their children to take and even higher so that they can have a stable home life so that they can have the ability to go away on vacation if they like to they can have the ability to save for children to go to college Thats the kind of future that people in this country want And debate we need to be having is how to have a better progrowth economy thats growing jobs and goodpaying jobs jobs at places Motorola Solutions or other kind of places across the country other great businesses that operate in New Jersey and other places across the country that create those kind of great paying middle class jobs Thats the debate we should be having Theres just not income inequality in this country Chris The bigger problem is opportunity inequality And thats what mothers and fathers are sitting around kitchen tables talking about wanting for their childrens future And thats exactly what I was saying at the Chamber of Commerce And I dont back off from those comments one inch WALLACE Finally Governor weve got about a minute left The last time we talked was last November just after you had been reelected as governor And at that time you were the front runner for the Republican nomination in those absurdly early polls Lets put them on the screen A McClatchyMarist national poll at that time had you leading potentially contenders at 18 percent Rand Paul at 12 and Jed Bush at 10 But late last month Bush was in front 15 percent with Paul at 13 and you at 12 I have two questions really one how badly have you been damaged by Bridgegate And secondly what do you say to people who may like you but worried that you may be too tough too bear bones to brass knuckled for the presidency And that even if you did know nothing about it that you created a climate in your administration where people thought closing lanes to a bridge was OK CHRISTIE Well first of all there was no climate in our administration that would ever permit that and the termination of folks who were involved I think proves that very clearly Secondly so those are our bipartisan record of having achieve property tax reform in New Jersey pension and benefit reform in New Jersey tax cuts in New Jersey five balanced budgets where today Chris were spending less in fiscal year 15 than the state of New Jersey spent the fiscal career 2008 seven years ago Those are all bipartisan achievements because I have a Democratic legislature bail reform this year and focusing on getting smart with drug rehabilitation  all bipartisan achievements that weve done this year And so the fact is you cant worry about those kind of polls for an election thats three years away And thats certainly nothing that I worry about or is even at the front of my mind What Im much more concerned about is doing the job for the people of my state which we continue to do In second term when you find  look at whats happened in Washington Chris You know they cant get anything accomplished down there from White House on down Yet in New Jersey were still passing major pieces of legislation So no Im not least bit concerned of any of that You know what Im concerned about Two things right now  first and foremost doing my job as governor of New Jersey and making our state a better place to live and work and raise a family And second electing as many Republicans to state houses across this country in nine days And I think were going to have success at both WALLACE Governor Christie thank you Thanks for joining us today Always good to talk with you To be continued sir CHRISTIE Absolutely Chris I look forward to it WALLACE How do you think Republicans will do in November Let me know on Facebook or Twitter FoxNewsSunday and use the hashtag FNS Up next as we head into the final week of a campaign how much of a burden is President Obama for Democrats and tight races Our Sunday group joins the conversation COMMERCIAL BREAK BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JEANNE SHAHEEN D NEW HAMPSHIRE SENATOR I never said I didnt want President Obama to come and campaign The fact is hes busy in Washington BARACK OBAMA PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA The bottom line is though these are all folks who vote with me They have supported my agenda in Congress END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE Thats helpful New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen tried to explain President Obamas absence from her tough campaign for reelection but the president failing to play along with Democrats who are eager to keep their distance from him And its time now for our Sunday group Brit Hume Fox News senior political analyst Nina Easton from Fortune Magazine syndicated columnist George Will and former Democratic Senator Evan Bayh Well before we get to the midterms Brit Chris Christie had in effect the coming out today at least on Sunday talk shows this year What did you think about his performance and his viability as a candidate for president in 2016 BRIT HUME FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST He was impressive in the sense that he was fluid on the issues he had good answers for your questions which were probing And I think what were seeing now is his reemergence Its not that the clouds that has hovered over him since this bridge scandal is gone But I think its dissipated over time The fact that the investigating groups have not come up with anything suggested you know they may be doing what theyre doing continuing to the investigation for the same reason that people always say you know what you always find something youre looking for in the last place youre looking  you stop looking when you find it  I dont think these people are going to stop until they find something but the longer this goes on the likelihood theyre actually doing that I think diminishes WALLACE Nina one of the things that surprised me in the presidential poll I put up for Chris Christie and lets put it up on the screen again is if you look at that Christie clearly has taken a hit from last December because of Bridgegate On the other hand despite all of this and his kind of absence from the national scene hes still right up there with the frontrunners NINA EASTON FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR He is And I think hes got two things going for him one he is incredibly authentic and connects with real people which is what people want these days Secondly low expectations I cant tell you how many people have written him off the pros have written him off because of Bridgegate And having low expectations is a really good way to start a race WALLACE All right Lets turn to the midterms and nine days out George a lot of these Senate races are between the Republicans and the Democrats Some of them Republican seats some Democratic seats are within the margin of error and the poll in this is really tight GEORGE WILL SYNDICATED COLUMNIST Its tight and its remarkable Because what that means is in Arkansas and North Carolina and elsewhere Democratic candidates are running double digits ahead of the presidents job approval rating which they simply should not be doing WALLACE Hes down at 31 32 33 percent and they are up in mid to high 40s WILL Thats right And right now the campaigns are focused on what they call low propensity voters that is voters who vote in the presidential election but have to be prompted and even prodded to the polls and off year elections and one measure of this is early voting We used to have Election Day now we have election month in this country in some cases election eight weeks six weeks Republicans say that theyre doing very well in early voting and absentee ballot voting we shall see Theres some very interesting polls out there The Denver Post poll shows that Cory Gardner the Republican Senate candidate is ahead of his opponent Mark Udall incumbent senator Among Hispanics 49 to 35 thats a 14 point lead among Hispanics for the Republican in Colorado WALLACE Senator Bayh your reaction to these polls despite all the talk about the unpopularity of the president and talk about a potential Republican wave the fact that theyre still so close and youve been there your best sense of whether Democrats hold on to the Senate or Republicans flip it EVAN BAYH FORMER US SENATOR DIN Well lets me answer the second question first Chris this is going to be very close The number of races that are still in play is extraordinarily high So its tough to answer A lot we are not going to know until election night But history geography and the presidents approval rating would suggest its going to be a good night for Republicans The big question is the Democrats and the Senate have invested about 60 million in get out the vote efforts Those voters that George was describing The Obama campaign was very good at turning those folks out they outperform the polls in many of these states including Colorado in 2012 and Michael Bennett running in Colorado in 2010 did the same thing Ticket state like Alaska small electorate Mark Begich invested a lot of money in trying to register and get out the voters in the indigenous population areas So I dont want to frighten you or your viewers here Chris but if I had to guess my guess is control of the United States Senate is going to come down to a runoff in December in Louisiana and quite possibly a runoff in Georgia in January WALLACE Let me ask you a one quick follow up question You talk about Democrats trying to get voters who dont  who vote in presidential elections but dont vote in midterms to come out and vote this time You are also talking about trying to get the Obama voters to vote when Obama is not on the ballot What do you think is the likelihood of success for the two of those BAYH At the margins you can usually move one two maybe three percent So the key here is that theres so many races that may be that close perhaps they can thread the needle and pull it off But it is a dilemma because many of these states are red states where the president is not popular and yet you are still trying to turn out base Democratic votes There is some kind of indissonance there WALLACE Just briefly final thought Brit HUME Well theres three  there is a bunch of factors that have been mentioned here that favor the Republicans But there are three One of which is we are referring to The Democrats turnout machine is superb and up until this month theyve also had a money advantage and finally theres a low esteem in which the Republican Party is held all of which constitute powerful forces that counteract the fact that this looks like its going to be a good Republican year and may determine whether its good enough for the Republicans to take control of the Senate WALLACE All right we have to take a break here When we come back attacks this week in Canada and New York City are raising fears about lone wolf terrorism What do you want to ask our Sunday group Just go to Facebook or Twitter at Fox News Sunday and we may use your question on the air COMMERCIAL BREAK WALLACE Now you can connect with Fox News Sunday on Facebook and Twitter Be sure to check out exclusive material online at

STEPHEN HARPER CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER We will be vigilant but we will not run scared We will be prudent but we will not panic and as for the business of government well here we are in our seats in our chamber in the very heart of our democracy in our world END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE Here here Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper taking a firm stand after two terror attacks on his country in three days And were back now with the panel Well it was not just Canada Take a look at this video in New York City this week Of a man with a hatchet who attacked New York City police officers Thursday Authorities say he had been visiting ISIS and other Jihadists web sites Heres New York City police commissioner William Pratt BEGIN VIDEO CLIP WILLIAM BRATTON NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER As Im looking at this at this particular point in time I would be comfortable Preliminary evaluation is that this was a terrorist act END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE No doubt in his mind about it George the two men in Canada and the one in New York seem to be classic selfradicalized lone wolf terrorists and if theyre getting recruited on their Internet and in their home how do we stop them WILL I dont think I would count this as being recruited There are 315 million people in this country and some are stark raving mad Thats just a fact And there is always going to be a problem with  in 1951 a man now unjustly forgotten Eric Hoffer published a book that called The True Believer in which he said mass movements religions the totalitarian movements of the 20 century often attract people who find in these movements not real politics but psychoanalysis Psychotherapy They project their disorderly inner lives on these things they get a sense of meaning out of it Im afraid its true then true now He received the Medal of Freedom from Ronald Reagan in 1983 for this insight We should revisit what he saw WALLACE Well that brings up an interesting question Because theres a debate Are these really terrorists Or are these going to be  you look at these people they have long criminal records they were down and out they are homeless perhaps mentally ill Does it make a difference what their motivation I mean if they end up doing their worst EASTON They have been called lone wolves I would call them stray dogs Theyre sort of skulking around dangerous figures looking for inspiration But its when they get the backing and the inspiration which is there now which is that  is a key strategy of ISIS is to radicalize westerners both at home with them and here And one thing I think not to terrify people but this is something that can go on for a very long time We have Leon Panetta former defense secretary saying this is a 30 year war AnneMarie Slaughter former top Hillary aide saying to me a couple of weeks ago we are looking at a 15 to 20 year war against terror now That ISIS has been let loose So this is something that were going to have to confront Were going to have to confront home And these guys in Canada they were trying to get to the Middle East and couldnt and they took it out here So this is the problem both in the Middle East and at home WALLACE George says this is not recording on the other hand Brit we have had three of these attacks just this week And one of the questions I have is is there something about ISIS and its claims of a caliphate of an Islamic state where they have great sophistication on the Internet with these beheadings and we know that this last fellow in New York apparently had visited those sites Is there something about them that makes them more attractive to the lone wolf stray dogs HUME Well it certainly makes it more attractive to people whose lives are in disarray Who have a propensity for violence But may be afraid to die The message from ISIS is youre going to glory You are going to be martyred So this not only gives them a reason to do this but it gives them a reason not to fear the outcome I mean this attacker was killed in a hail of bullets from the police guns He didnt care apparently So he was prepared for that If ISIS is able to inspire violent nut cases across the United States and therere plenty of them to carry out random attacks first on the police but possibly later on random citizens this is especially frightening and does have the effect I think of terror And that video you showed is truly frightening WALLACE I want to get back to this question of what do we do about it How do we stop it We ask you for questions for the panel and weve got a bunch like this on Facebook from Paul David Henson who writes Why is our governments monitoring of our eCommunications still failing to stop a radical who posts plainly on Facebook their intentions Whats good is it to monitor and detect if you are only going to sit back and watch the attack Senator Bayh pretty good question How do you answer Paul BAYH Its hard to answer Paul Civil libertarians will say its not enough to just express radical thoughts Theres got to be some action behind it But these is hard as the panel has indicated here These are individuals who arent communicating with wide networks that we can normally listen to and pick up on Theyre already in the country so we cant stop them from getting in And its a balance between protecting society from these maniacs these radicals on the one hand versus preserving some zone of privacy on the other Therein lies detention WALLACE Well as weve seen though theres a controversy George obviously about the NSA and all of the surveillance and we know that they are able to track at least the fact of every phone call and every email Do we need  not fewer less surveillance but more surveillance so that when a guy like that is posting horrible things and some of these guys also in Canada were doing that we pick it up and somehow they fall into the security net WILL The question becomes what does monitoring mean Frankly friends relatives family ought to notice that the people who are close to them are deeply disturbed and they ought to have public health officials that they can turn to and say this is symptomatic of potential violence The idea that the central government the National Security Administration or something collecting meta data in vast form of this in billions and trillions can then find these few needles in that enormous haystack and then the federal government can monitor I dont know what means frankly We have to be  this is something to be done at the local level with people who know these people and see something disturbing unfolding  WALLACE But at least Nina in the case of that fellow who went into the parliament in Canada ZehafBibeau his mother said she had not seen him in five years So some of these people just drop out So you wonder who whats the net around them of family and friends thats going to say hes off the rail EASTON Some of them do drop out And by the way Im going to put this in the same basket of something we have not talked today about today which is school shootings And I would put all of this in the same category of when you see something say something This is  this is a see ph that we use to fight terrorism since 911 We need to set up a mechanism at the federal level where people can call in where troubling social postings because theyre public you see these When you see these troubling postings you have some place to go with it Lets take a school shooting The Santa Barbara shooter His mother was scared to death that this guy was going to take a gun out and shoot those kids in Isla Vista Where by the way my son lives So Ive taken a real interest in this But this is  I think its something that you can approach in a similar way which is if you see something say something and where does somebody who is troubled by the postings the activities the talks of somebody that they know where can they go WALLACE But I told you part of the quandary there Brit is even if you did let somebody know that so and so is posting terrible things what are you going to do about it HUME You cant INAUDIBLE to follow every one of these people around at all times WALLACE And you cant commit them for just writing something on  HUME Therein lies part of the problem here We you know everyone who lives in an urban area and in other areas as well know that theres lots of people who are not playing with a full deck or are lying around in our parks and they appear to be harmless and they cant be  they cannot be institutionalized because a course of rule that such people may not be WALLACE In a lot of cases theyve been released from mental institutions HUME Exactly right So I think thats an issue that may need some to be revisited as well is how  you can commit these nutty people to institutions to keep them from being on the streets where they may become  WALLACE Final thoughts in 30 seconds BAYH Two quick points Chris as horrific as this is its still a wide aberration You have got a lot greater chance of getting hit in a car accident than you do being attacked by a hatcher from a terrorist So we have to keep in perspective Secondly at the end of the day this is an empty ideology In our way of life well triumph in the long run It may take years but eventually these merchants of death are not on the right side of history WALLACE Thats a hopeful note on a very bleak week Thank you All of you All right Were going to take a quick break here When we come back well have the panel back The World Series in full swing but viewers are not tuning in like they used to George Willis  whats happening to Americas pastime COMMERCIAL BREAK BEGIN VIDEO CLIP UNIDENTIFIED MALE There INAUDIBLE Giant swing Sandoval delivers END VIDEO CLIP WALLACE My best Joe Buck impression San Francisco Giant third baseman Pablo Sandoval delivering the two out bases love ph and single that gave his team the lead over the Kansas City Royals in game four the World Series The series of course now tied at two games apiece And were back now with some extra innings for our Sunday group Well we were struck by an article in the New York Times this week about not how many but how few people are watching the World Series Lets put the stats up on the screen 122 million people tuned into the opening game That may sound a lot That is the lowest rated game one on record 129 million watched game two By way of comparison 25 million people watched the World Cup soccer game last summer between the US and Portugal double the audience for the World Series opener George is our baseball guru What is wrong with the national pastime WILL Not a thing If 20 years ago it was 12 billion dollar industry and now its a 9 billion dollar industry If you add up the combined attendance of the national hockey league the National Basketball Association the National Football League Major League Baseball draws 14 million more people than those sports combined 95 percent of all selfidentified NFL fans have never been to an NFL game and never will Its a television program And theres a reason for that in part Because a lot of people would rather not go to the experience the stadium ambience which is to say nothing more rowdy To watch grown men get concussion LAUGHTER WALLACE We like the NFL here too George Anyway this has been a trend for decades and the fact is that its been going on this way Take a look at these numbers that last nine years have produced the eight least watched World Series This is watched And check this out 122 million people as we said watched the Kansas City Royals in game one this year The last time the Royals were in the Series in 1985 the games averaged 345 million viewers Thats pretty dramatic BAYH Well it reflects the proliferation of media options and athletic options Chris People just have a lot more choices these days So nothing is going to be quite as dominant as it used to be My hope is and I would defer to the guru but my hope is that this does not you know its not evidence of a broader trend in society the sort of immediate and constant gratification culture we seem to have developed where the pace of the game may just not lend itself quite so much to that WALLACE All right WE have less than a minute left So we are going to have to be quick Brit baseball knows it has a problem They have scheduled this World Series so theyre not going up against Thursday night football and they are not going up against Monday night football HUME Yet they are yet as if this was the case last night they are up against college football WALLACE But you cant avoid everything HUME Well I understand But college  I think football college and pro and even high school has supplanted baseball as the national obsession But I think football as George has suggested may be under a death sentence because of the concussion problem If thats not solved kids are not going to be playing and that means that eventually the game will wither WALLACE But were under a death sentence because were flat out of time Nina I apologize LAUGHTER WALLACE I know youre a big sports fan I had to tell her that the World Series was happening Thank you Panel See you next week in New York as we preview the midterms from Fox News election headquarters Now a quick program note you can catch and please do game five of the World Series tonight on your local Fox station

Fox,http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/10/30/watchdog-group-faults-justice-department-in-probe-on-smuggling-grenades-parts/,"WASHINGTON AP  Federal agents and prosecutors in Arizona made multiple errors in their investigation of a US citizen who was suspected of smuggling grenade components to Mexico including failing to arrest him when there was more than enough evidence to do so the Justice Department watchdog said in a harshly critical report Thursday The inspector generals report found parallels between the investigation into Jean Baptiste Kingery by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives and Fast and Furious an ATF gunrunning operation along the Southwest border that relied on flawed tactics and became a political firestorm for the Justice Department Those similarities include poor supervision weak oversight and a failure to take or insist on overt enforcement action against the subjects of the investigations Our reviews of both cases concluded that in failing to act they did not adequately consider the risk to public safety in the United States and Mexico created by the subjects illegal activities the report states In a statement Justice Department that in the past six years it had taken aggressive action to ensure that the mistakes of the Kingery case were not repeated The department said the officials responsible for the operation have either left the department or been reassigned and noted that the deputy attorney general last year issued guidance to US attorneys offices around the country about overseeing sensitive operations According to the report the ATF learned in 2009 that Kingery was ordering grenade components from an online military surplus dealer that agents suspected were being transported into Mexico for use by drug cartels Agents over the next few months intercepted deliveries of grenade components for Kingery But instead of trying to arrest him for the illegal export agents marked the components so they could be identified later and set up surveillance to determine if the parts were being taken into Mexico The operation came under public scrutiny in 2011 after Mexican soldiers found grenade hulls bearing similar markings The investigation also faults the ATF and the US Attorneys office in Arizona for failing to prosecute Kingery after he was stopped at the border in June 2010 transporting hundreds of grenade hulls and fuses A prosecutor said Kingery was not arrested because the ATF wanted him as an informant though ATF agents said he was never used as an informant and that prosecutors simply refused at the time to bring charges Kingery returned to Mexico where he was arrested in August 2011 Mexican authorities are prosecuting him for allegedly violating organized crime laws In Operation Fast and Furious federal agents permitted illicitly purchased weapons to be transported unimpeded in an effort to track them to highlevel arms traffickers Federal agents lost control of some 2000 weapons and many of them wound up at crime scenes in Mexicoand the US Two of the guns were found at the scene of the December 2010 slaying of border agent Brian Terry near the Arizona border city of Nogales Follow us on twittercomfoxnewslatino

Russianmade he said with a smirk My grandfather used the same one     Iraqi Kurdish fighters on the front lines of battle say they have yet to receive the heavy weapons and training pledged by the United States and nearly a dozen other countries to help them push back the Sunni militants USled airstrikes have forced the militants to retreat or go into hiding in towns and villages across northern Iraq paving the way for ground forces to retake territory seized by the militant group in its lightening advance since June across western and northern Iraq But without more sophisticated weaponry the Kurdish fighters known as peshmerga have had to rely on aging arms like the Sovietera cannons a centerpiece of the offensive Tuesday to retake Mahmoudiyah and the nearby strategic towns of Rabia and Zumar While some newly sent arms have stacked up in the Kurdish capital including a shipment from Germany this week Kurdish officials say they cant be distributed until the Kurdish fighters are trained The delay shows the difficulties on the ground as the US and its allies bomb the militants from the air Peshmerga were only trained before to save Kurdistan and to prevent terrorists from coming inside Kurdistan said Halgurd Hekmat spokesman for the Iraqi Kurdish force in Irbil the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region We plan to send the heavy weapons but only after making sure the soldiers know how to use them in battle and fix them when the weapons have a problem At a checkpoint outside Rabia in northwestern Iraq some two dozen peshmerga soldiers stood guard Wednesday to secure the town they had just retaken Only one wore a flak jacket We dont have them Special Forces commander Hakar Mohsen said One of many things we need A halfmile away the Rabia hospital remained an active battleground with Islamic State militants holed up inside sniping at the Kurdish soldiers At one point the Kurdish fighters fired off a round from one of their aging cannons to a chorus of cheers though it was unclear if it hit its target We could retake the hospital so easily if we had the right rockets said Mohsen Most of our injuries here were from roadside bombs which could have been limited if we had bomb detectors for example As he spoke several Kurdish units were fanning westward to try to reclaim the strategic town of Sinjar which would almost certainly secure the main road between Syria and Iraq used now by militants to ferry weapons and fighters between the two embattled countries The US and Western allies including Britain France Germany and the Netherlands have committed to arming the Kurds agreeing to send machine guns assault rifles and ammunition Hekmat said some units had received the ammunition since it requires no training However fighters at more than a halfdozen units interviewed by The Associated Press said they had yet to receive anything Retired Lt Gen Michael Barbero a former US commander in Iraq who just returned from a trip to Irbil said it was clear to him that the US is not delivering the weapons the Kurds need to fight the Islamic State group The short answer is no they are not getting the heavy weapons they need he said adding that the Kurds were in great need of American technology to counter roadside bombs They took a lot of casualties in the fight on the Syrian border Kurdish fighters on the front lines said they could not have retaken the towns in Iraqs northern Nineveh province were it not for the USled airstrikes We could not do this without the help of America said Captain Hoshyar Harki a peshmerga fighter based in Mahmoudiyah Meanwhile in neighboring Syria Kurdish fighters have been on the defensive as the Islamic State militants pressed a relentless assault on the strategic northern town of Kobani also known as Ayn Arab near the Turkish border Nine Kurdish fighters including three women captured in clashes in the border region were beheaded by the Sunni extremists according to the Britainbased Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Dozens of militants and Kurdish fighters were killed in the fighting it said Images posted on social media networks showed womens heads placed on a cement block said to be in the northern Syrian city of Jarablous which is held by the militants The photos could not be independently verified but corresponded to AP reporting of the event The creation of the peshmerga in the 1920s coincided with Kurdish independence movements following the collapse of the Ottoman and Qajar empires and for much of their history they have operated much like a rebel movement During the USled invasion of Iraq in 2003 the highly disciplined peshmerga swept down from the semiautonomous Kurdish region and established a strong presence in a belt of largely Kurdish towns and villages stretching south toward Baghdad The disintegration of Iraqi forces in the face of the Islamic State groups advance in June led the peshmerga to assume full control in areas they have long coveted further enhancing their autonomy from Baghdad and undermining US efforts to bring about a stable multiethnic Iraq They have fought well many analysts say considering their lack of training Peshmerga is fundamentally a militia said Richard Brennan an Iraq expert with RAND Corporation and former US Department of Defense policymaker who said that much of their arsenal to date includes AK47s and a few Sovietera weapons and vehicles But they are fighting for their homeland and they are motivated unlike what we saw with Iraqi security forces in Mosul when they fell apart upon the first sign of threat The Islamic State militants captured many of the weapons left behind by the Iraqi army including Kalashnikovs machine guns antiaircraft guns and mortars said an Iraqi intelligence official speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media The militant group is also in possession of about 35 Iraqi military tanks about 80 armored police vehicles and hundreds of Humvees They got so many weapons from the Iraqi military that theyre taking some to Syria now said Khalil Abdulrahman Zebari one of the Kurdish fighters in Mahmoudiyah As for the pershmergas aging weaponry Mohsen the Rabia commander joked We are so used to fixing old broken weapons that peshmerga fighters also have a good future as weapons repairmen ___

WASHINGTON  The Obama administration is boxed in by its promise to limit US military engagement against Islamic State extremists making it tough to agree to Turkeys condition for joining the fight in neighboring Syria Turkey and other US allies want the US to create a nofly zone inside Syrian territory Doing so would mean embracing one of two options President Barack Obama has long resisted cooperating with Syrian President Bashar Assads government or taking out its air defenses action tantamount to war     Airstrikes alone might not prevent Islamic militants from carrying out a massacre at a Kurdish border town but for now the US isnt steering a new course in its expanded onemonth counterterrorism effort in Iraq and Syria Demands are rising for the creation of a secure buffer on the Syrian side of its frontier with Turkey as the US and its coalition members plead with the Turks to prevent the fall of Kobani where the United Nations is warning of mass casualties A safe zone would require Americans and their partners to protect ground territory and patrol the skies meaning it would have to enforce a nofly area Turkey an American NATO ally is demanding such a step for a variety of reasons A buffer might stem the flow of refugees into Turkish territory It also could provide Syrian opposition fighters with a staging ground for their rebellion to oust Assad   something that Turkey wants to see happen The US wary of the implications wants the focus to remain on defeating Islamic State militants whove captured large areas of northern Syria and Iraq Yet some of Americas closest partners and Obamas fiercest foreign policy critics at home are sympathetic to Turkeys request France issued a statement this week announcing its support The Republican head of the House Foreign Affairs Committee believes Arab countries would shoulder the load Even Secretary of State John Kerry is describing a nofly zone as worth examining Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has shown little enthusiasm for the idea American leaders are open to discussing a safe zone he said this week but creating one isnt actively being considered When it comes to the socalled buffer zone nofly zone theyve proposed these for some time State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Friday We are not considering the implementation of this option at this time For the US military creating a protected corridor in Syria safe from the Islamic State groups ground attacks and Syrias air force raises obvious red flags Gen Martin Dempsey the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has estimated the endeavor would require hundreds of US aircraft and cost as much as 1 billion a month to maintain with no assurance of a change in battlefield momentum toward ending the Syrian civil war That means US enforcement could become openended The Pentagon learned that lesson in Iraq when it established a nofly zone over northern Iraq to protect Iraqi Kurds and another over southern Iraq to protect Shiites    both in 1991 in the aftermath of the Gulf War Those protective zones were enforced by US Air Force and Navy pilots for a dozen years until the March 2003 invasion of Iraq Implementing such zones in Syria would create a direct confrontation with one of the Middle Easts most formidable air defenses a system bolstered in recent years by topoftheline Russian hardware The Syrians possess multiple surfacetoair missiles providing overlapping coverage and thousands of antiaircraft guns capable of engaging attacking aircraft at lower levels Moscow infuriated Washington last year when it confirmed that it would sell to Syria its S300 antiaircraft missiles considered to be the cutting edge in aircraft interception technology For the Obama administration the political challenges of a nofly zone may be even greater Given the threat to US pilots the military would need rescue personnel stationed nearby perhaps in Turkey or Iraq If a US flier were shot down a rescue team would have to put boots on the ground in Syria which Obama has repeatedly ruled out Engaging in direct military action against Assads government also would severely stretch the United States already tenuous claims that its intervention in Syria is legal under US and international law Many members of Congress are challenging the administrations justification for war on the basis of the Bush administrations 2001 authorization to fight alQaida The Islamic State group grew out of the alQaida movement but the two are now enemies The US has no UN mandate to wage war in Syria against rebels or the government To avoid these pitfalls the US could try to reach an accommodation with Syrias government But Obama has ruled out this step too even if Syrian forces are similarly battling the Islamic State militants because of their atrocious list of alleged human rights violations and war crimes These include massacres of civilians and opposition forces and several chemical weapons attacks according to Western governments and human rights groups Washington is searching for an alternative approach with Turkey On Friday retired Marine Gen John Allen the US special envoy and his State Department deputy Brett McGurk met in Ankara with senior Turkish officials and NATOs secretarygeneral and discussed where we think Turkey can contribute more especially along the military line of effort Harf said She praised Turkey for agreeing to help train and equip moderate Syrian opposition forces and said US military planners would hold further talks with their Turkish counterparts next week Kerry meanwhile is headed to the Middle East for some coalition massaging this weekend according to US officials On the sidelines of a Gaza reconstruction conference in Cairo he will discuss the effort against the Islamic State group with foreign ministers from Egypt Qatar Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries pressing for more robust American action Kerry however isnt preparing to present a new direction in the strategy said the officials who werent authorized to speak by name on the matter and demanded anonymity ___ AP National Security Writers Robert Burns and Lara Jakes contributed to

issued for failure to appear to testify in a closed evidencegathering session in August AP PhotoDieu Nalio Chery FileThe Associated Press PORTAUPRINCE Haiti  Former Haitian President JeanBertrand Aristide returned home from exile in 2011 to a jubilant welcome but lately he has seemed more like a prisoner Police have been stationed outside the cementblock walls of his compound for several weeks keeping watch and awaiting orders to carry out an arrest warrant issued by a judge investigating allegations of corruption drug trafficking and money laundering that date back about a decade The warrant was issued for failure to appear to testify in a closed evidencegathering session in August     As rumors have circulated that an arrest was imminent supporters of the twiceelected twicedeposed president have flocked to the compound along a busy stretch of road near downtown PortauPrince A few weeks ago they clashed with police throwing rocks and setting up fiery barricades Their numbers vary with just a few at times but some are there at all times in a tense vigil President Aristide loves us the Haitian people so we must protect him from those who want to persecute him said Juste Wuilson Jean one of a dozen men stationed outside the compound last week Authorities say the standoff may come to an end soon The investigating magistrate Lamarre Belizaire recently summoned the police chief to court to explain why his order has not been carried out more than two months after it was issued Police spokesman Frantz Lerebours said commanders are simply waiting for the best time to move Its up to us to judge when the opportunity is right Lerebours told The Associated Press Well take action when we can have the least problems possible If Aristide is brought to court for questioning Belizaire can drop the charges allow him out on personal recognizance while investigations continue or lock him up in jail Typically in Haiti if the judge thinks there is reason to pursue the case the accused is put in jail usually for months sometimes for years without trial said attorney Brian Concannon director and founder of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti That outcome could lead to unrest for a country that has been enjoying a period of relative tranquility following years of tumult Although out of power for a decade Aristide remains divisive in Haiti He is beloved by many as a champion of the poor who led opposition to the dictator JeanClaude Duvalier and he is reviled by some elements of the Haitian elite Aristide became the countrys first democratically elected president in 1990 was ousted from power within a year and then returned to power with the backing of the US government He was ousted during his second term in 2004 in a violent rebellion amid accusations that he allowed corruption and orchestrated attacks on opponents The former priest is still popular enough that rumors of his impending arrested have prompted thousands of supporters to take to the streets of PortauPrince burning tires and throwing stones or clapping their hands and singing Our blood is the blood of Aristide Belizaire is investigating allegations of corruption money laundering and drug trafficking dating from Aristides second term But the judge has not discussed details of his investigation publicly and declined interview requests Maryse Narcisse the leader of the Fanmi Lavalas party that Aristide founded denied that the former president was flouting the law and argued he was never properly served with the summons to come to court for questioning One of Aristides lawyers Mario Joseph asserts the allegations are meant to discredit Aristide and by extension the Fanmi Lavalas party before legislative and municipal elections Voting was supposed to be called by the government of President Michel Martelly in 2011 but remains unscheduled due to a stalemate with six opposition senators Presidential elections are also due next year But Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe dismissed those allegations as absurd saying the judge is conducting an independent probe into a 2005 draft report from Haitis financial intelligence unit that first made the corruption allegations against Aristide The judge is an independent judge doing an independent inquiry into a report that was drafted six years before President Martelly was in office Lamothe told The Associated Press As is typical of Haitis rumor mill gossip is churning One of the latest stories swirling through PortauPrince is that a special cell has already been prepared for Aristide at the dismal national penitentiary Salim Succar legal counsel for the prime minister said the rumors are absolute gibberish He said the judges investigation of Aristide is a matter of justice and Belizaire is courageously pursuing the matter against the exleader whose cult of personality remains strong perhaps dangerously so among Haitis poor He said guns have recently been fired menacingly outside the judges home Many speculate there will be bloodshed in slums if Aristide is carted off to court but others wonder whether Aristide out of power for a decade is mostly a faded force Alex Dupuy a Haiti expert and sociology professor at Wesleyan University in Connecticut noted that Aristides political party is divided and not as powerful as it used to be There could be some unrest in PortauPrince areas where he still has some significant following But given the shift in the political balance of power in Haiti I doubt very much that his arrest would generally cause significant or sustained unrest said Dupuy author of a 2006 book about Aristide titled The Prophet and Power But in Bel Air a rough warren of shacks on a hill overlooking the area where Haitis national palace used to be before it pancaked in the 2010 earthquake residents say they are bracing for more trouble than usual Aristide is one of the big men of Haiti said shoemaker Paul Francois Bonhomme as he played dominoes If hes arrested there will be people in the streets and many will get hurt,2014-10-27T00:30-04:00,guns
Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2014/10/01/dallas-ebola-patient-public-health-risk/,This is a rush transcript from The Five October 1 2014 This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE COHOST This is Fox News alert There is breaking news tonight in Washington The head of the Secret Service has resigned after a series of recent security lapses including the breach at the White House where a fence jumper was able to make it all the way to the East Room Details now from chief White House correspondent Ed Henry at the White House Ed     ED HENRY CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT Well good to see you Kimberly this is pretty dramatic because as of this morning Josh Earnest White House press secretary was on television saying the president still had full confidence in Julia Pierson the Secret Service director shocking because a series of democrats like Elijah Cummings a top democrat on the panel that was investigating this whole mess and come out and said they have lost confidence or suggested she needed to go Chuck Schumer the democrat from New York was coming out late this afternoon saying she needed to resign I pressed Josh Earnest a few moments ago what took them so long to decide on this What changed in the last few hours And they say Its just that Julia Pierson stepped up and offered her resignation I pressed out from his why not fire her after these breaches Why did they take her resignation and do the procedure He just said basically they did not know about that incident in that Atlanta elevator at the CDC where a security guard who had a gun and a criminal record the Secret Service was not aware of got inches from the president That was a tipping point here because the president was left out of the loop that his safety had been in jeopardy again just a couple of weeks ago Im also told one last bit of color that when Julia Pierson went up to the office of the Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson today to offer his resignation he not only immediately accepted it but said it would be effective immediately Theyre not even giving her time for a transition they realize they have got to turn the page on this fast Kimberly GUILFOYLE All right Thanks Ed HENRY Thank you GUILFOYLE And now to the Ebola scare lots of news today on the first case diagnose in the United States Earlier we got an update on the condition of the patient in a Dallas hospital BEGIN VIDEO CLIP DR MARK LESTER TEXAS HEALTH RESOURCES Were categorizing his condition as serious but stable END OF VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE We also heard from Texas governor Rick Perry on some children who came in contact with the Ebola patient BEGIN VIDEO CLIP GOV RICK PERRY RTEXAS Today we also learned that the some school age children were identified as is having  had contact with the patient and are now being monitored at home for any signs of the disease I know the parents are being extremely concerned about that development But let me assure these children have been identified and they are being monitored END OF VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE And CDC Director Tom Frieden was on the Fox  Friends this morning and said his agency is monitoring the situation BEGIN VIDEO CLIP STEEVE DOOCY FOX  FRIENDS COHOST What about the people who were in the emergency room when he first came in and said I dont feel good and they said Take some antibiotics and go home Those people are being monitored too right DR THOMAS FRIEDEN CDC DIRECTOR We have a nine person team in Dallas working in with the hospital with the health department and the family to identify every possible contact and well be monitoring every one of those individuals for 21 days thats the tried and true public health means of stopping an Ebola outbreak END OF VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE So you have questions Well here to explain to us what this outbreak means is Fox News medical correspondent Dr Marc Siegel doctor thank you for being with us today DR MARC SIEGEL FOX NEWS MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT Great to see you guys GUILFOYLE Happy to have a member of the ATeam So a lot of people have questions and of course there is some genuine concern about the spread of this and how its transmitted and how concerned should we be SIEGEL Well Kim first of all you know whenever theres a new outbreak out there a new emerging disease everyone personalizes it everyone gets scared Theres a lot of hysteria we covers it but we have to cover it responsibly because you know what Its normal to be afraid but that not the science of this The science here is that this is an extremely difficult virus to get And Duncan this patient got it because he was helping a dying pregnant woman into a cab and came in very close contact with her bodily secretions thats how you get it Now here in the United States the CDC has nine top officials on the ground an epidemic intelligence officers five of them three senior public health officials that know how to track the diseases Like Sherlock Holmes theyre gonna figure out whether these contacts that he had in the emergency room with family whether they could have it And there will be closely watched and if they develop any symptoms therell be isolated But I guarantee you that everyone out there watching this thinks some family member was there an ER person Theyre already thinking ahead these people are all going to get sick Theyre not This is not going to be a sustained outbreak because the science of the virus will not allow for it In West Africa where they wash their bodies where they keep close contact with sick people where they get very close to sick people and theyre afraid of health care thats why its spreading there at a rate of two people getting sick for everyone that has it Here it would never be two people getting sick for everyone that have it So it cannot be a sustained outbreak It cannot where an epidemic here and we have got to watch all these scare terms that we use GUILFOYLE For example SIEGEL Well outbreak How about outbreak Remember the movie Outbreak You use words  GUILFOYLE From the book Hot Zone SIEGEL Yeah I mean Outbreak was Ebola actually and so one patient an outbreak doesnt make You use words like epidemic Now I think we have to focus on the difference between whats happening in West Africa and whats happening here GUILFOYLE But we were talking about the issue of containment being able to effectively you know SIEGEL We can GUILFOYLE Understand the contacts and then being able to quarantine someone who has it and in proper procedure in their care and if somebody passes away to make sure you dont further spread the disease But people can still be concerned but if they get it themselves something horrible could happen SIEGEL Well and I understand that I want people out there to know its extremely unlikely that it is gonna spread beyond just this hospital and may be one or two cases And look as long  and I already gonna say this as long as its going on in West Africa theres a risk of more cases coming here Theres going to be more cases here I think but well isolate those ERIC BOLLING COHOST So  SIEGEL Not gonna happen the same way BOLLING So doc here  I was gonna wait because I know everyone calls me the alarmist here but again abundance of caution there are 13500 or so US  the people with US passports in these three countries Sierra Leone and in the other two there where  where the outbreak is substantial 13000 potential people coming over here as we now know that they dont show symptoms they cant  it cant be that they dont show any symptoms when they are at the airport where theyre on the airplane maybe not even after they arrive here for a few days So mean to say that its not gonna spread anymore thats very optimistic Our own president couple of weeks ago said well be working with airports and governments to make sure it doesnt show up GUILFOYLE He is talking about people who asymptomatic and this gentleman got two days later CROSSTALK BOB BECKEL COHOST Let me talk  can I just call him he said So it doesnt  someone doesnt get out on an airplane and bring it to the US And guess what happened yesterday SIEGEL Well it is gonna happen It is gonna happen Let me make a point about this asymptomatic people in airplane Did you know that the Center for Diseases Control that the study in the 1990s looking at the tuberculosis Did you know that two thousand people who flew with active tuberculosis did not spread a single case while on the plane If you touch somebody on the plane with Ebola youre not gonna get Ebola if you breathe their air youre not gonna get Ebola they can be BOLLING Im not suggesting that people gonna get it on the airplane CROSSTALK SIEGEL Theyre not Theyre not BOLLING But Im suggesting that there could be thousands of people who could fly in from these countries that are  heavily infected and bring it here and have it spread here SIEGEL Eric Im gonna surprise you let me make a case for something If it gets  if the numbers get high enough I wouldnt be opposed to cutting off plane flights from those countries If thats where going with this But those  the numbers are one right now GUILFOYLE All right Lets take on the table Bob BECKEL Let me ask you a question and heres the question what is the minimum contact you would have to have to get Ebola in his fluid secretions in other words someone would have to spit at you I mean what SIEGEL I  spitting is not the easiest way to get it I mean its literally blood vomit I mean youre not going to get it by touching someone or kissing somebody youre not getting it that way Its much deeper than that Its much for more prolong contact with actual secretions BECKEL OK So now there were  its very very hard to get and if I kiss somebody I probably gonna get it right SIEGEL Well you might LAUGHTER SIEGEL But most people not seriously GUILFOYLE Bob making a serious point I mean if somebody has you know an immune deficiency or something like that perhaps they could be more susceptible But we also heard some information about people who might have been exposed SIEGEL Its a viral load GUILFOYLE Right SIEGEL Its how much virus you get and you dont get a lot till you very sick and you get a prolonged exposure very very close exposure GUILFOYLE All right Greg has a question GREG GUTFELD COHOST I just want to make a point Because we talked about this before The interesting thing about Ebola is that when asymptomatic its not contagious But when its symptomatic youre so sick that you often arent out in the public Unless you have to be like a pregnant woman who is dying for this man heroically saved and is now paying the price So when in a weird way when you are really really stricken with this disease you cant get out to spread it so you almost quarantine yourself Then it gets the next question about the idea of quarantine the issue here in Africa which it cause this the spread it is went from rural to urban which was a first after four decades this is the first time this happened Thats why its spreading Number two they have superstitious health practices washing corpses which we dont do SIEGEL Absolutely GUTFELD But the most important thing is that fear and panic exacerbates it When you panic you are less likely to participate imprudent health practices You do not wash yourself you do not think clearly and that is I think the most important point correct Is that we dont force people to think in a panic mode SIEGEL I wrote about this in my book False Alarm In the plagues in the middle ages the plagues spread because people panicked and they tried to get out of the quarantines that were super closed GUTFLED Right and they afraid of the doctors SIEGEL And they afraid of the doctors and they even attacked the doctors But in this case I actually think the military is playing a positive role theyre going to build hospitals and build places for patients to go inform health care workers I think our sending the military over there is positive but we need a worldwide effort here and a lot of money that contain this in Africa We dont have to worry about here were always worried about here here here We got to worry about over there we have a worldwide health problem GUILFOYLE Dana DANA PERINO COHOST Well in  so Nigeria which is a relatively more wealthy nation than Liberia and Sierra Leone was able to   apparently theyre reporting that it is contained within Nigeria and I agree with it SIEGEL Exactly PERINO So what needs to happen in your opinion in Liberia and Sierra Leone extreme poverty like I went to Sierra Leone theres barely a light switch in the place So what do you think  beyond our troops what would you do if you had a magic wand what would you do to try to help contain it and then eradicate it SIEGEL First the magic wand would be build a lot more than 17 of those centers that were building I want the world to come in and build hundreds of those centers Then theres gonna be education and theres gonna be  were sending 50 workers from to the CDC over there but we need a lot more health workers to educate them And then to Gregs point the people have to be educable I mean they have to be able to understand that this thing can be controlled by modern medicine but their culture tells them different Here comes the modern medicine man and Im concern about that and thats something that wont go away overnight PERINO Thats one of  I think theres another role to be played a beyond the troops and I think it is one that we talked about with ISIS as well and that is propaganda from the United States Above  I know that the medicine men in a lot of those places scare their own people SIEGEL Exactly PERINO And I think why dont we then affect  we should be talking to the medicine men and plant like little seeds of ideas and then so that they spread GUTFELD Its hard Its harder than it looks I mean CROSSTALK PERINO I know GUTFELD Its like they did with AIDS I mean SIEGEL A big challenge PERINO But we know that they can  for example with fistula problems and in particular in Liberia theyve been able  and Sierra Leone they have been able to talk to tribal leaders to get them to convince them that their women could actually be sick so that they bring them to the hospital And actually that was a young woman named Ann Gloag from Scotland she was able to do that in Sierra Leone I mean shes different SIEGEL To this point theres gonna be a vaccine available in the year I believe The NIH is getting a great response to one vaccine It will be a big challenge to try to get it distributed over there It could be a game changer for enough people take it GUILFOYLE Doctor Siegel what about the children we heard Governor Perry say that some of the children had come in to contact the Ebola patient And what perhaps would their parents told what would you tell them if they were listening here tonight SIEGEL They have to be watched closely for 21 days because Ebola can be transmitted  can start to make you sick within 21 days usually its about a week And they have to watch out for signs of fever and flu symptoms And even though Ive been down playing all the fear here tonight I want to add that the initial symptoms are flu like Now luckily its not flu season right now So if you were in West Africa and I was interviewing you you came off a plane and you went to Liberia Id say well youve got fever You got flu symptoms I will isolate you These kids if they start to get sick have got in to isolation GUILFOYLE Thats part of the questioning Trihars ph in an emergency room try to last inaudibletravel SIEGEL It should And they didnt do it to him initially GUTFELD They should focus on the travel history GUILFOYLE Its two days from BOLLING Can we touch on that  they want us to go quickly so he did present himself in a hospital on September 26 not until September 30 if was he diagnosed with Ebola where was the breakdown for four days this guy was basically  could have the ability to infect other people SIEGEL Agree completely Eric and I also think that the health care workers who initially came in contact with him have to be carefully watched Because those were the guys that actually come in to contact with these secretions So it will be quite possible to someone else to get sick here Theres a breakdown because they didnt ask the basic question where did you travel from PERINO But how do you fix that SIEGEL Yeah In  you have to involve GUILFOYLE Application PERINO But we have  theres a waive ph about on this about this for several months in fact there was an article by two doctors and Mike Gersten has written several pieces about how the White House the administration was slow to act SIEGEL Absolutely Yes PERINO OK But we have known for this like for like a year that Ebola problem that weve known than for four months And we had the president at the CDC three weeks ago How is it that a hospital is still not informed about the proper procedures Thats the break  I mean you might not know the answer to that SIEGEL Well Ill answer it this way every doctor has an obligation to know this This is part of basic medical history PERINO Right Im mean not by the way SIEGEL Its not about watching TV for President Obama or watching us even Its about knowing what you do as a doctor PERINO Yeah Is it that the CDC responsibility to get information out to the hospital SIEGEL Oh sure But ever physician should ask this automatically I ask every patient who comes to see me Where were you Did you travel recently BOLLING Part of the basic GUILFOYLE Right We got one more question Bob has to get in BECKEL I was going to say people in that emergency room though that have been followed and so far no symptoms You can go treat somebody in an emergency room take blood in the restph as long as you have gloves unless you come in contact with food youre all right right SIEGEL Yeah unless you come in contact with secretions BECKEL Secretions SEIGEL Yeah thats right There was a question of immerse ph thats a good point Bob If you see a guy across the room were you wearing gloves and even if you took blood from him youre probably not gonna get sick You have to come in direct contact with secretions GUILFOYLE All right SIEGEL I mean I wouldnt be surprised if theres not another case out of this I wouldnt be surprised if there was another case out of this It is not gonna spread I know Eric is indubious ph it is not gonna spread BOLLING Im not indoubious ph Again abundance goes out share  I remember when this thing first in everyone said that all these hospitals that were making contingency plans were being ridiculous Meanwhile SIEGEL They should They should They should BOLLING And they should still SIEGEL They should CROSSTALK GUILFOYLE All right Dr Marc Siegel What a pleasure thank you for coming on here and informing us about this And its also patient responsibility think about where you traveled as well Ahead the suspect in Oklahoma beheading was arraign today and federal authorities say terrorism charges are being investigated Well have the details next COMMERCIAL BREAK BOLLING Alton Nolen aka JahKeem Yisrael was arraigned today in Oklahoma Hes the radical Muslim who beheaded one of his co workers while yelling Islamic phrases So I call the terror thats my opinion of course Why the FBI the DOJ and the state of Oklahoma so slow to call this cockroach ph terrorist Nolen was ordered with held without bond and even asked the judge his court appointment attorney to be Muslim KG can he do that GUILFOYLE Well he can do whatever he wants whether its gonna be granted is a whole other story I mean whats his justification for saying that he needs to have Muslim representation I mean hes just being honest this is who he is this is what he believes in this is his ideology this is his religion So Im not surprised by this turn of event BOLLING And Bob did DOJ to their credits said we  they actually mentioned terrorism in one of their statements today The FBI said theyre going to wait and see but theyre not sure yet And the state of Oklahoma is also been very very slow to call a terror Whats the holdup BECKEL Well I mean I think theres a lot of pieces of evidence here that are missing and we dont know we found that they were in fact not terminated he was let go for  were suspended for a while I think the idea of asking for a Muslim attorney makes it wide open for him to be hit from every direction on this I think theres plenty of mounting evidence that the guy is certainly an Islamic fundamentalist to describe as a terrorist I dont know what the official legal term terrorism means so until I do until I have more facts I just have to go along with what the FBI is doing BOLLING Lets put it this way if the FBI has one opinion now one on the DOJ another and the government of Oklahoma a third Who do we subscribe to Who do we listen to him PERINO Well I dont know who will end up having jurisdiction over it But I think that we can trust  for those three entities will work it out And this come and said yesterday the penalty is the same he would be eligible for the death penalty if found guilty But I think that we have to give him a little bit of a time this is not you know an episode of the NCIS within a show everything is wrapped up and we understand everything So I think they are being prudent I do worried that we are giving a little bit too much attention to this person Im worried about copycats and not enough attention to the family  the victims family You just imagine every time they close their eyes they are  we are going to live in nightmare for the rest of their lives and the they deserve our support and they deserve swift justice and I think that they will  are being supported by the authorities in Oklahoma but they need to know that we will not turn a blind eye to it That we as a country are concerned that we have to trust the authorities BOLLING Greg I want to ask something when Im not sure we have enough time to do it But is it time to profile GUTFELD You that I always feel that profiling is just basically assessing facts But the idea of calling this workplace violence is the issue because where why does it matter where violence occurs If you get shot at a carnival it that should that be called fairground violence If youre shot in the woods should that be camp fire violence no its violence In this case its terror because he wants you to believe that its terror so why dont we take him at his word And again you know I want just bring up something on the Goldberg said which is a really good point The White House fence jumper is continually being linked to his military service But the beheader the media goes out of its way to avoid linking it his Islamic beliefs So it is OK in a crime in an insane crime to link to the military not so much with Islam why is that BOLLING Bob why is that Greg has thats a great point If the guy yells out Islamic phrases hes got Bin Laden ISIS all over his Facebook page man what more happens do you conclude BECKEL I cant offend the media say where they are saying But not  make we more convinced about this is Id like to see the communication that he had or may have had with the Arab terrorists BOLLING Why cant he be a lone wolf Why cant he be a homegrown terrorist CROSSTALK BECKEL No he is very much can and thats the hes really would be a terrorists I would just know of this PERINO Do you think who his getting contact is with BECKEL What is like to know if he did Thats all BECKEL My point of view Im sorry He did worship at a mosque that has been linked to Allah ph I mean come on Bob BECKEL Yeah But it is as I said PERINO Well I just  the one thing it might show is whether or not if he is in contact with somebody if that somebody is inciting others to do similar things I think that is where the Intel would actually help At least we assure everybody GUILFOYLE Absolutely to prevent the next one if there is someone else has been similarly radicalized or that he made contact with and has somehow has inspired them Because that was they want That is the threat of Jihad thats how it spread BOLLING Rules of evidence can you get more aggressive with some of its been classified as terrorist then would you have GUILFOYLE If by being more aggressive you mean additional resources Perhaps But the point is I think that they are putting our community resources before they trying to get all the information BOLLING How about  if he is a terrorist  am I wrong If he is a terrorist he doesnt have the right to a speedy trial GUILFOYLE Right Well if that does change But heres the problem were already went down to this path were going down the state path and I think regardless they should make sure and make the proper classification this is terrorism they should to path even while this path is proceeding they can do it PERINO Well there could be people in Oklahoma that would prefer to keep this at a state jurisdiction rather than for it to go to the FBI GUILFOYLE Yeah GUTFELD But these were a member of the KKK who brutally murdered a black man I dont know if it would be called workplace violence may be would be a hate crime and perhaps an act of terror PERINO And racism GUTFELD Yeah BOLLING Can we do this stand as for it Can we do  this is from the family before we go on not forget about the victim of the beheading the family of Colleen Hufford issued this statement today losing our mom wife and grandmother has been one of the most difficult challenges any of us have faced in our lives for her life to have been taken by such a tragic act of violence as a depth of grief we are trying to comprehend we want to thank the wonderful family and friends who have come to our aid during this very difficult time with messages of hope and prayer We will miss her dearly BOLLING All right next convicted cop killer Mumia AbuJamal gets invited to give a commencement address at Vermont College What does the victims with think about that We will be hearing from Carl when we come back COMMERCIAL BREAK GUTFELD Hooray coldblooded cop killer Mumia AbuJamal has been picked as commencement speaker at Vermonts Goddard College Now if you never heard of this college heres why Behold one of the minds behind this choice a voice of the new tolerati sacrificing morality before the altar of cool using dialogue to mock the dead BEGIN VIDEO CLIP UNIDENTIFIED MALE Our graduating students had decided that they wanted Mumia to be their commencement speaker at this graduation And its the colleges policy that we dont oppose MEGYN KELLY FOX NEWS ANCHOR Why UNIDENTIFIED MALE Because that is our policy as a college that advocates for complicated dialogue around complex issues KELLY What dialogue is there going to be Whos going to  whos going to represent Maureens side UNIDENTIFIED MALE The graduating students believe that Mumia has a message coming from prion from a unique perspective and speaks to issues that are important to them that are important in a world where we have Ferguson KELLY Right UNIDENTIFIED MALE  where we have police brutality where these issues are real and in their lives END VIDEO CLIP PERINO In Vermont GUTFELD I think the technical term for that is hooey So you call a cop killers words a unique perspective You just became a heinous cheerleader to a criminal whose victims still walk the earth Like Maureen Faulkner the widow of the officer Mumia had killed in 1981 Here she is again on Megyns show BEGIN VIDEO CLIP MAUREEN FAULKNER WIDOW OF MURDERED POLICE OFFICER My husband was in a community college He was getting ready to graduate with his bachelors degree when Mumia put a bullet into his back and then between his eyes But does anybody talk about that No END VIDEO CLIP GUTFELD Now I get why its cool to invite this loser this murderer to speak Radicalism is what many of todays college students have instead of actual achievement But would they have cast their vote in front of Maureen Of course not theyre cowards who likely dont know real suffering because if they did they wouldnt do this Meanwhile Yale is welcoming an Islamist cleric whos preached death against us Weeks after students there protested the invite to Ayaan Hirsi Ali a victim of that ideologys gruesome mutilations So campuses embrace bombers like Bill Ayers cop killers like Mumia and misogynous creatures of death ph and they charge parents thousands for this privilege Only in America where you can earn a degree in hate and still call it tolerance Forget quarantining Ebola quarantine Yale and Goddard That kind of thinking is deadlier than any disease So KG GUILFOYLE Yes GUTFELD The remarks the killers remarks are going to be  theyre prerecorded and theyll be played alongside a video short for the commencement Do you think any students there will have the guts to heckle GUILFOYLE No of course they wont Because they will be worried about being politically correct and having the disdain of their fellow student body members that somehow revere this horrifying disgusting human being who is nothing more than a murderer I mean I really feel he has no value whatsoever on the planet And its so disrespectful It saddens me that this is where education and students are going And this isnt the first time hes done it by the way Hes given commencement before GUTFELD Yes exactly Eric if that was  if your son was at that college what would you do BOLLING The president Bob Cane ph says our grads express quote the freedom to engage and think radically If Im an employer and I heard  see Goddard College no and think that these are the guys that chose Mumia for their commencement speech there Absolutely not welcome in my company Also Mumia has a nationallysyndicated radio show from prison GUTFELD Yes BOLLING Do I understand that How does that work GUTFELD I dont know BOLLING Who advertises on Mumias radio show PERINO How is that allowed BOLLING How is it allowed is right David GUTFELD Absolutely Because hes cool Hes edgy Hes  you know hes a revolutionary So what if he killed a cop Hes a revolutionary Its politically derived right Bob By the way this college I just want to point out is a low  called a lowresidential model Students only go for eight days and then they study independently and eat with faculty PERINO And thats going very well GUTFELD Yes it certainly has Bob BECKEL First of all just so we dont leave the impression that every university and every college in America has cop killers and bombers and radicals I think theres a very small percentage that do One thing I will say this guy graduated I understand from this school GUTFELD Right 96 While he was in prison BECKEL And he has given other GUILFOYLE Commencement BECKEL  commencement addresses in Washington state in Antioch GUILFOYLE Antioch College and Evergreen State College in Washington BECKEL Right And so the only thing I can say is that if this is the rules of their college whether we like it or not and the students vote to do this what do you say You cant have free speech I mean whats  I understand what do you say to the widow and all the rest of the horrible things about it but if this is the rules and they voted that way how are you going to change it GUTFELD I think its a fair question And thats why I think Megyn did a great job of exposing his answer which was such bologna He said dialogue Thats the last PERINO Well theres no dialogue Its a prerecorded tape GUTFELD Exactly PERINO Heres what I think When you have  you would imagine that graduates want to be inspired GUTFELD Yes PERINO  so that they can go on to do great things GUTFELD Yes PERINO Do they aspire to end up in jail GUTFELD Yes PERINO  with a nationally syndicated radio program apparently GUTFELD He would havent had one He wouldnt have had the radio show if he hadnt killed the cop PERINO True And who is teaching current events at Goddard College Because Mumia is so oldschool There are so many other people that if you are worried about  they say this is an issue of importance in their lives There are people like  you would have been bold Like invite the director of and the creator of Orange is the New Black OK Thats talking about prison reform GUTFELD Yes PERINO And concerns Rand Paul and Cory Booker together they have joint  they have a pile ph of legislation for prison reforming That would be bold GUTFELD Yes PERINO That would be interesting Why dont you invite somebody like that GUTFELD Its not cool enough BOLLING Very quickly so the FCC is cool within Mumia spewing this stuff on  every Sunday night from his prison cell But theyre not cool with commentators They might not be cool with commentators using the name Redskins on the air right now Do you think their priorities are a little screwed up here GUTFELD Yes Well the campus priorities are now reflected in moral chaos that they would actually reject say a woman whos a victim of political  religious practices but had the people who actually practice them BECKEL Some GUTFELD I will say some I will say some Can I read this one thing from this  its what the statement from the college interim president Bob Kenny this is what he had to say Choosing Mumia as their commencement speaker shows how this newest group of graduates express their freedom to engage and think radically and critically in a world that often sets up barriers to do just that Who is setting up the barriers No ones stopping them Youre stopping the widow from talking you jerk GUILFOYLE Its terrible How about be refreshing and invite Faulkners widow to come speak and open your mind and your hearts GUTFELD Thats too scary GUILFOYLE Im scared for their future because look at whats in their head GUTFELD All right Coming up the Secret Service director is officially out Moments ago Julia Pierson resigned after a series of security breaches Well bring you the reaction from the White House when we come back COMMERCIAL BREAK PERINO This afternoon the director of the Secret Service resigned after coming under fire for a series of recent security breaches Last month a fence jumper was able to make his way deep inside the White House Just days prior to that incident an armed security contractor who has a criminal record was allowed to ride in an elevator with President Obama when he visited the CDC in Atlanta White House press secretary Josh Earnest claims the president still has confidence in the agency BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JOSH EARNEST WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY The president has nothing but the highest regard for the men and women of the Secret Service These are individuals who are highly trained highly skilled professionals who wake up every morning prepared to put their lives on the line to protect the first family and to protect the White House END VIDEO CLIP PERINO I  Kimberly I think that the White House has shown amazing restraint in not commenting on this issue and on supporting the Secret Service They rely on them for their security So I think that Ive admired that But I do think its interesting that this morning they were expressing confidence in her Julia Pierson the woman who resigned from the Secret Service But do you think it just became just so overwhelming that it was so inexcusable and so unacceptable that they basically fired her today GUILFOYLE The uns have it Yes And unbelievable Really This is the Secret Service This is the best that our country can do to protect the first family I mean honestly yes Kudos to Michelle Obama because shes being quite restrained If my family was in a compromising position like that on multiple occasions and even situations withheld that they werent made aware of its  its very disturbing to me This is one situation where I actually wish we didnt have transparency Im so horrified to know that this was a fact that everybody else out there does PERINO Well I guess that was a question or whether or not they were trying to protect the security by not releasing the information GUILFOYLE Right PERINO But lying to the American public Bob that is  thats going a step too far BECKEL Well you and I both worked in the White House and the first thing that amazes me is that this guy could have gotten into the East Room I mean that through a cordon of  you have to go through at least five or six Secret Service agents to get there When I worked there even with my badge on GUILFOYLE Yes the graphic is up there Bob Theyre showing it BECKEL They would stop me once in a while just to make sure my badge was accurate GUTFELD And that you had pants on BECKEL And that I had pants on And youd be surprised how many times I didnt But the other thing was I think it was the elevator situation even frightening to me that they allowed an armed guy on the  all the time Ive ridden in an elevator with the president of the United States nobody including local police could carry guns on the elevator with him Let alone a contractor that they hadnt checked out through the national database GUILFOYLE How do you explain this Why did this happen BECKEL For me I dont know PERINO One of the things theyre saying Eric is that some people in the Secret Service are suggesting that budget cuts to the Secret Service have caused this problem However I just think if theres so many fence jumpers why dont they just improve the fence Thats sense Like make it higher They can still make it look historic GUILFOYLE Why dont they make it electric GUTFELD Are you talking about our borders or the White House PERINO No Im  there is a parallel there but at least it could be started at the White House You could BOLLING Allow me this Im going to defend him a little bit Look I like the Secret Service I think theyll take a  they are trained to jump in front of a bullet When you think about Ronald Reagan the time  all those times that theyre doing  the US Marshall Service the Secret Service the military Yes they had a lapse I agree with Bob the lapse with the elevator with President Obama at the CDC was a big problem but there could be other issues Youre right I think theyve learned their lesson Theyre going to fix this I guarantee the White House wont be breached again theyve learned their lesson And by the way Director Pierson did the right thing She stepped down There was calling for her to be stepped down bipartisan calls GUILFOYLE You know there are some surveys too That they went to those fine men and women in the Secret Service and they themselves identified specific instances that there were breaches or problems They want the reforms Great people that work there PERINO Lois Lerner could learn something from Julia Pierson I think I mean who has less confidence in her than anybody in the world She basically lied to the nation and then pled the fifth I want to ask you Greg real quickly the Republicans  Peter Baker of the New York Times I dont know if he necessarily meant to say it this way but he thought that it was  he left an impression that maybe it was fake concern GUTFELD Yes That it was actually  it was criticism wrapped outside with concern So it would look like Were really worried about the president but were actually using this scandal to beat up on the president some more He might be right However each scandal every one of these Secret Service problems is stayed by one that follows it Its like watching a parade of floats each one is worse than the next Does anybody remember Mandelas funeral Do you remember the translator Do you remember how crazy that was That guy was so close to President Obama and he was nuts PERINO And they said that never should have happened GUTFELD But the other part that we have to remember too GUILFOYLE Fake translator GUTFELD You have to remember too is that among the Secret Service the morale is very low And theres a culture of fear Theyre afraid to be fired if they speak up about whats going on because they know that no one has their back when they go up against President Obama because the media has been on a sixyear you know coffee break and theyre not analyzing these issues So the poor Secret Service are afraid to do anything because they know no ones going to protect them PERINO All right Were got to run Joe Clancy has taken over Hes a great guy Secret Service I think we can all have confidence in him Up next WalMart says Tracy Morgan is at least partly to blame for the accident that left him in critical condition because he wasnt wearing a seat belt And Tracy cant believe it His reaction when we return COMMERCIAL BREAK BECKEL This just in the district attorney in Oklahoma has decided to seek the death penalty against the person who was  was responsible for beheading that wonderful woman All right Now back in June comedian Tracy Morgan was critically injured when a WalMart truck driver crashed into his limo killing a member of his entourage but WalMart is not taking the blame They say Tracy wasnt wearing a seat belt Tracy Morgan is not happy about that saying quote I cant believe Wal Mart is blaming me for an accident that they caused end quote All right Kimberly let me ask you a question This guys been indicted for vehicular homicide the driver Has nothing to do with the lawsuit that WalMart is now saying theyre going to contest because he wasnt wearing a seat belt They have any case at all GUILFOYLE Well theres two paths right So the criminal case well thats not going to have any bearing on it The driver is going to be found guilty or not guilty based on facts and circumstances and no theory of quote comparative fault or contributory negligence will come into play In the civil case what could happen is they could say Mr Morgan this is a terrible accident to happen However your injuries were exacerbated by the fact that you broke the law You did not wear your seat belt Therefore you suffered greater pain and suffering because of that So they may try to reduce his injuries depending on the percentage amount they feel he perhaps was culpable in his own injuries BECKEL All right Dana I know you want to pass on this Let me ask you from a public relations PERINO No I just said that we had a little bit of time so I was giving you back my time BECKEL I appreciate that From a public relations standpoint is Wal Mart better off just not following this up and contesting this PERINO Well theyre in a lawsuit right And in a lawsuit theres  PR is one thing and their legal strategy is another If it is indeed a fact that Tracy Morgan was not wearing a seat belt then that is a fact that is a part of the case Tracy Morgan is suing WalMart has an obligation to respond GUILFOYLE To reduce damages BECKEL OK But  Eric is BOLLING I will agree with you and say  and I guess both and say let the court  let that come out in court not necessarily a little bit too early PERINO Its a legal filing They had to  they had to file a brief so its in the documents GUILFOYLE Its basically an affirmative defense on their behalf otherwise theyd be precluded from arguing it in court Can I just point out that thats part of the problem with the legal system right now is that someone whos injured is suing everyone And the bigger the name the bigger the target the more active theyre going to BECKEL Greg have you been wearing your seat belt when you were hit from behind GUTFELD Absolutely I do want even to comment on the lawsuit I do think its a little  you know this is when all the lawyers get out and they talk and they try to do stuff Theres a  its a weird practice when people are in when theyre not driving when theyre in a cab or a black cab or luxury bus or whatever They relax their safety measures And I yell at my wife all the time that you just think oh its not really  its safer Its not safer GUILFOYLE Bottom line WalMart should settle the case GUTFELD Just be careful BECKEL Youre right they should One More Thing is up next COMMERCIAL BREAK GUILFOYLE All right time now for One More Thing Were going to bring you some emotional testimony from Jill Tahmooressi Of course she is the mother of the jailed sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi And she is on the Hill today in front of the foreign affairs committee BEGIN VIDEO CLIP JILL TAHMOORESSI MOTHER OF ANDREW April 1 2014 Mom Ive been arrested Please secure me an attorney April 5 Mom Im not going to make it through the night April 14 Mom I tried to kill myself These quotes horrific in varying degrees for a mother pale in comparison to Andrews statement that My time in Mexico has been far worse than my two combat tours to Afghanistan END VIDEO CLIP GUILFOYLE The mother of course detailing

VIDEO CLIP GUTFELD Gregs Sports Corner END VIDEO CLIP GUTFELD Very excited about this Its the Russian cat fight hot tub Olympics Lets go right to it Here we have Captain Fur Bucket Next is Lieutenant Fuzzy Ball Youve got Fur bucket hes trying to get up there if you can see but youve got Fuzz Bucket hes right there He says No youre not going in And hes back down And you think its over but then hes able to pull a double whammy He knocks him down and it looks like Captain Fur Bucket has lost and Lieutenant Fuzzy Face wins BECKEL Very interesting stuff GUILFOYLE All right This is allegedly a real show OK PERINO I love that I love that OK so we talked about is midterms and mostly about the Senate races But the gubernatorial races are very interesting Twentynine GOP governors only 21 Democrats And believe it or not I didnt realize it wasnt on my radar screen Republicans have a few pickup opportunities in some blue states including a race that was not something I was paying attention to but Im going to is the Republican Tom Foley in Connecticut is  looks likely to win Hes up about four points over the incumbent Democrat Malloy And I just think this will be interesting over the next few weeks to see how  if the Republicans can actually close it GUILFOYLE Beckel BECKEL I want to wish a belated happy birthday to my sister Peggy I was going to do this yesterday but we couldnt She is the  by far  theres the two of us when we were very young She is by far the nicest person youll ever meet and shes the only person I can say who has never said a critical thing about anybody at least Ive

Fox,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/10/20/watching-movies-with-sex-and-violence-may-lower-parents-viewing-standards-for/, Parents may get so accustomed to seeing sex and violence in movies and television that they end up lowering their standards for what kids are allowed to watch a new report suggests In a new study parents who watched several clips of movie violence in succession became desensitized over time and they relaxed their standards for what they would allow their children to see     In particular the researchers point out the violence in PG13 movies has become more graphic over the last several decades We released a study last November that showed a dramatic increase in violence and in particular gun violence in popular PG13 movies over the past 10 years said lead author Daniel Romer of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia There is now actually more gun violence in PG13 than in Rrated movies he told Reuters Health by email The new study suggests that parents are now more willing to allow their children to watch these movies he said This is consistent with surveys done by the Kaiser Family Foundation showing that parents express less concern about both sex and violence in movies Romer said For the study researchers asked 1000 parents of preteens and teenagers to watch a series of movie clips one after another For each clip parents recorded the minimum age at which they would be comfortable allowing their child to view the movie The six movie clips which ranged from 15 to 59 seconds were arranged randomly for each parent viewer and came from popular PG13 or R rated movies Violent scenes usually involving guns came from the films Collateral Taken 2 Die Hard Live Free or Die Harder and the Terminator series while the sex scenes were taken from 8 Mile and Casino Royale At first the parents rated the violent scenes and the sex scenes as appropriate for 17yearolds on average By the last clip in the series parents deemed scenes of a similar level of violence and sex appropriate for 14yearolds according to results in Pediatrics They also reported more willingness to have their own child view the movie by the end of the sequence The increase in movie violence and concurrent desensitization may be working to fuel each other Romer said We potentially have a cycle of more violence in PG13 movies which is the most popular rating category today leading to greater acceptance among parents leading to the Motion Picture Association of America encountering less resistance in rating those movies PG13 which 15 years ago would have been rated R he said There is evidence that viewing a lot of violent TV content starting in grade school can lead to more aggressive behavior as children age he said This is a difficult thing to research and several studies have looked at this question in many different ways said Dr Jeanne Van Cleave of the Pediatrics Department at Harvard Medical School and the Division of General Academic Pediatrics at MassGeneral Hospital for Children in Boston Although they have their limitations collectively studies indicate an association between viewing violence and later tendencies toward aggression Van Cleave told Reuters Health by email She wrote a commentary accompanying the new study in Pediatrics We dont know how gun violence in particular affects this process Romer said and there is less evidence for how if at all sexual media affects childrens development There is a risk that kids who are vulnerable to imitate violence they see in movies and television will do so especially if they have access to guns and a reason to use them he said My professional opinion as a pediatrician is that yes there is a pretty important difference between seeing these things at age 14 compared to age 17 Van Cleave said There is a lot of cognitive and social development that happens between these ages such that a 14yearold and a 17yearold are going to come away with different impressions of the same thing Parents should be aware that PG13 movies can contain high levels of violence Romer said It is hard to be objective as a parent about deciding whats okay for a child to watch and what isnt Van Cleave said Being aware that PG13 movies can be quite violent while still attaining that rating may help parents in their decisionmaking,2014-10-20T14:02-04:00,guns

 Dems look to new Colorado voting law to save Senate
 Ruhroh Dem congressional approval lowest since 94
 Power Play Brown breaks down his Senate strategy
 Hillary heats up rhetoric
 Leave em laughing     DEMS LOOK TO NEW COLORADO VOTING LAW TO SAVE SENATE
Colorado is the key to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reids firewall It along with Democratheld seats in Iowa and North Carolina is part of the last line of defense against Republican majority If they lose any of these three seats it would be hard to imagine Reid  Co holding the Senate And right now things arent looking good for the blue team in Colorado After an abysmal campaign by Democratic incumbent Sen Mark Udall Republican challenger Rep Cory Gardner holds a lead of nearly 3 points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls And any incumbent polling at an average of 44 percent the week before the election would ordinarily look like a sure loser But Colorados election is going to be anything but ordinary The combination of sameday registration and mailin ballots also has many on the right worried about outright fraud in what could be a razorthin vote to decide a razorthin Senate majority Even without fraud though Republicans have reason to worry

The latest NBC NewsMarist Poll gives Rep Cory Gardner RColo 46 percent to Democratic Sen Mark Udalls 45 percent

Wild West  Colorado is making its first foray into voting by mail leaving just a handful of inperson polling places around the state Similar moves in Washington and Oregon have helped cement those states as Democratic bastions after decades of dabbling in occasional Republicanism Instead of having to physically take unenthusiastic voters to the polls in vans Democrats could just catch them at home and get them to sign on the line and mail in their votes But the specifics of Colorados law as David Drucker explains go far beyond even whats been done in the Northwest As Democrats work hard to fire up Hispanic voters with talk of a mass amnesty granted by President Obama after the election Colorado also remains the only state on the midterm map to boast a large enough Latino population to provide an opportunity for Obamastyle demographic dicing to be successful As Democrats demonstrated in 2010 for Reid an organizing surge can help save an incumbent down in the polls

Washington Examiner Enough noncitizens illegally vote in US elections to potentially decide close races a new study suggests Old Dominion University political scientists Jesse Richman and David Earnest found in an article due to be published by the journal Electoral Studies that 64 percent of noncitizens voted in the 2008 elections and 22 percent voted in the 2010 midterms

Not flatfooted  Republicans though have learned some lessons in Colorado Aside from actually competing for Latino votes the GOP has also gone all in on the votebymail system With over a half million ballots received according to the most recent figures from Colorados secretary of state election offices have tallied 62000 more ballots from Republican voters than Democrats That puts the GOP in the lead with 44 percent to Dems 32 percent hardly where anyone expected the race to be given the incredible sums that Democrats have spent on advertising and organization Remember that Udall unlike some other endangered Dems is actually very liberal Hes not running against the president hes mostly been talking about ladyparts But Republican operative remain very nervous that despite a new focus in the party on pushing early voting the state is just too friendly to Democratic base turnout efforts with the new law One top GOPer told Fox News First that he thinks Garner needs to be up by more than 3 points in preelection polls to actually pull out the win

AP Former President Bill Clinton is headlining an evening rally in Aurora today Hell be promoting Udall along with Gov John Hickenlooper and congressional hopeful Andrew Romanoff

Knock knock  Whatever the case the new voting regime provides Democrats unprecedented opportunities to drive turnout even when their voters are not feeling enthusiastic Its one thing to have to go wait in line to vote but quite another to just sign on the dotted line when the party canvasser comes to your door

Kobani when more than 30 Islamic State militants backed by snipers and pickups mounted with heavy machine guns began their assault across the dusty fields Holed up in an industrial area of squat concrete buildings on Kobanis eastern edges the outgunned Kurds could do little to repel the attack recalled Dalil Boras one of the defenders during the Oct 6 assault The Islamic State groups firepower proved too much so the Kurds withdrew through the gray streets to a treelined park ceding a foothold in the town to the extremist fighters who promptly raised two black flags over their newly conquered territory     A week later the Kurdish men and women of the Peoples Protection Units or YPG are still holding out if barely with a helping hand from more than 20 airstrikes by the USled coalition against Islamic State positions They have been battered by tanks shells and mortars and picked off by snipers using Americanmade rifles They have no answer for the heavy weapons that Islamic State fighters have looted from Iraqi and Syrian army bases And while they are slowly yielding ground they so far have prevented the town from being overrun defending it zealously with little more than light weapons boobytraps and a fervent belief in their cause Along the way the predominantly Kurdish town along Syrias border with Turkey has been transformed from a dusty backwater into a symbol of resistance for Kurds around the world It also has grabbed the international media spotlight which has helped turn the defense of Kobani into a very public test for the Americanled international effort to roll back and ultimately destroy the Islamic State group The battle itself is now playing out in Kobanis streets and alleyways   a fight being watched by scores of Syrian and Turkish Kurds as well as dozens of journalists through binoculars from hilltops and farms just across the border in Turkey From that vantage point the town spreads out among the rocky hills and brown fields just beyond the frontier Plumes of black smoke billow over the lowslung skyline The occasional thud of mortar shells mixes with the clatter of heavy machine guns and assault rifles Kurdish fighters and civilians who have recently fled describe a much grittier scene inside the town Both of the warring sides have knocked holes in walls to move between buildings    a tactic employed in urban fighting for decades On cross streets blankets have been hung to limit exposure to snipers Rubble litters the streets Smoke hangs in the air The few remaining civilians have sought shelter in basements Boras a short and stocky 19yearold dressed in dusty black jeans and a black Tshirt explained how Kurdish fighters are organized into small groups of sometimes as few as five or six people who stake out positions on the front lines Teams with rocketpropelled grenades and Russiandesigned machine guns known here as Doshkas have taken up positions in the upper stories of some buildings to maximize the Kurds limited firepower We are communicating with walkietalkies Boras said recently during a threeday break from the fight We tell them on our walkietalkie that theyre attacking and we throw a red smoke bomb to show the position of the attack and then the machine guns and RPGs provide support Kurdish men and women fighters spread out on the various fronts are mainly armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles and grenades They carry backpacks with ammunition biscuits and canned beans and hummus and when they run low they call into headquarters We have special words for martyrs wounded ammunition and food on the walkietalkie Boras said They frequently switch frequencies to avoid being spied on over the airwaves Since the Islamic State group first moved into Kobanis eastern districts on Oct 6 the fighting has developed a familiar rhythm the Kurds say The extremists own the day while the Kurdish forces rule after sundown when the Islamic States heavy weapons cant effectively target Kurdish positions At night we go out on missions to hunt them down During the day they put pressure on us said Boras We watch during the day to see where they are And then if theres a street that needs it we plant roadside bombs to hit them with during the day With limited resources the Kurds have had to improvise Boras recalled on one occasion packing a truck tire with explosives and then rolling it down the hill toward Islamic State fighters destroying a machine gun post As the fighting has ground down in the thick of the town the front lines in some places have narrowed to just a few meters yards said Aladeen Ali Kor a Kobani policeman now volunteering in a refugee camp in the Turkish town of Suruc while he recovers from a shrapnel wound to the back of his neck There are some places where youre basically across the street from them Like from here to the back of the gas station there he said pointing across the busy main road in Suruc Fighters on both sides yell and taunt each other We say well never let you in They yell at us that theyll never let us out alive Kor a stout 36yearold with a tightlycropped brown beard flecked with gray said most of the Islamic State fighters captured by the YPG are Syrian although there are also many Turks Chechens and Yemenis mixed in among them At one point he pulled back the white hand towel rolled up on his neck to show the three stitches and swollen wound He was out on a patrol he said when a mortar round slammed into a building nearby followed by a second that hit the street Another guy was wounded in the leg and belly and two guys were killed he said I didnt pass out but I was dazed Friends took me to an ambulance There was blood everywhere Most of Kobanis wounded are brought to the hospital in Suruc Two emergency room nurses taking a short break recounted the chaos of the past few weeks We usually see 2530 wounded a day They are serious injuries Mostly from gunshots and shrapnel said one of the nurses who only identified himself as Mehmet The nurses estimated that 70 percent of the wounded are fighters while the rest are civilians For now at least the heart of Kobani remains in Kurdish hands although their grip appears tenuous at best With so much attention on the town neither side can relent Activists say the Islamic State group has rushed in reinforcements while small numbers of Kurds continue to sneak across the border to join the fight One of them is Boras Reached by telephone late Saturday night he said he had slipped back into Kobani and returned to the front Having already lost his father and a brother fighting the Islamic State he said he sees no alternative but to make his stand there Either Kobani will fall and I will die or we will win he said ___ Mohammed

during a media open house at the Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms ATF National Laboratory Center in Beltsville MarylandReuters Lets say a stalker is threatening a female friend of yours She asks you if she can borrow your handgun She is trained and has no criminal record Should you loan her your gun If you live in Washington State loaning her your gun may soon make you a criminal and will likely land you in prison     Suppose you are a Boy Scout leader Once a year the scouts take a trip to a local farm where the boys earn their firearm merit badges If you continue to stick with this annual ritual you may soon find yourself in prison Those two examples illustrate just a couple of the hidden consequences for ordinary citizens if Washington State voters pass Initiative 594 on Tuesday  the biggest gun control initiative on any state ballot this year Gun control advocates are putting a huge effort into winning passage of the initiative With 95 million from billionaires such as Michael Bloomberg the initiatives supporters are spending half as much asthe NRA is spending on all political campaigns and initiatives across the entire United States Yet despite a huge money advantage gun control advocates are still using totally inaccurate claims to make their case to voters Mark Kelly who heads one of the organizations spearheading the initiative made a very common claim for the initiative recently on CNN He told host Jake Tapper right now 60 percent of all gun sales gooccurwith a background check Why do we allow the 40 percent the other 40 percent to happen But even the normally antigun Washington Posthas noted this claim is false and given it three out of four Pinocchios on its fact checker blog The 40 percent figure Kelly pointed to rounds up a claim that 36 percent of gun transfers were done without a background check And that number was obtained from a small 251person survey conducted two decades ago from November 1991 to December 1994 Most of the survey covered sales before the Brady Act instituted mandatory federal background checks Even if it had been a reliable survey it tells us nothing about background checks after the law More importantly the 36 percent figure had little to do with sales The vast majority involved transfers not sales inheritances or gifts from family members If you look at guns that were bought or traded just 12 percent would have been transferred without a background check And again most of this survey was before the federal background checks went into effect By the way if gun control advocates really trusts this survey they should not ignore this other fact from its findings it found that all gunshow sales went through federally licensed dealers Unfortunately the current system of gun background checks is severely flawed and often causes dangerous delays for people who suddenly need a gun for selfdefense such as a woman being stalked by an expartner Beyond the crashes in the federal governments computers 8 percent of background checks are not accomplished within two hours with most of these delays taking three days or longer Like so many other supporters of Initiative 594 Kelly gets another basic fact wrong He asserts roughly 17 million criminals and mentally ill people have been stopped from buying a gun by a background check since 1999 But these were only initial denials not people prevented from actually buying guns Remember the five timesthat the late Sen Ted Kennedy missed flights because his name was on the no fly list Kellys method of counting is equivalent of saying that the no fly list stopped five flights by terrorists The federal government dropped more than 94 percent of those initial denials after just preliminary reviews with more false positives discovered after that In 2010 the last year a complete report for the federal government has been released out of 76142 initial denials only 49 were referred for prosecution and just 13 of those ended in conviction For most such delays are just an inconvenience But for a few delays can be life threatening as it prevents people from defending themselves Indeed research by one of us suggests these delays slightly increase violent crime particularly rapes Proponents of I594 such as Geoff Potter communications director of the Washington Alliance for Gun Responsibility assures voters We know that closing the background check loophole will save lives But there is not a single study by economists or criminologists that support that claim Worse even gun control advocates admit that the initiative will at up to 60 to the cost of getting a gun My own research indicates that it is poor minorities who live in crime urban areas who benefit the most from owning a gun but those are precisely the people who will be discouraged by this substantial fee from getting a gun for protection Even if the background system worked perfectly it wouldnt have stopped the high school shooting that killed two people last month at a Washington State high school The shooter stole the gun he used Nor would the law have stopped any of the recent mass public shootings in such places as Newtown Ft Hood the US Navy Yard or Aurora Colorado Also note that even complete gun bans in Washington DC and Chicago havent stopped criminals from getting guns Expanded background checks might well be reasonable but only after the current system is fixed The poorly written and confusing initiative is going to turn a lot of wellintentioned Washingtonians into criminals The fees and regulations attached to the initiative will primarily make it harder for lawabiding citizens to get guns for selfprotection  John R Lott Jr is a columnist forFoxNewscom He is an economist and was formerly chief

slavery extremism and child labor at great risk to their own lives AP PhotoBernat ArmangueThe Associated Press NEW DELHI  One is Muslim the other Hindu One a Pakistani the other Indian One a school girl just starting out in life the other a man with decades of experience Despite their many differences 17yearold Malala Yousafzai and 60yearold Kailash Satyarthi will be forever linked   cowinners of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize honored for risking their lives for the rights of children to education and to lives free of abuse Their selection was widely acclaimed their heroism undeniable     But something more was at work here In awarding the prize Friday the Nobel Committee also sent a blunt message to the rival nations of India and Pakistan that if two of their citizens can work for a common goal their governments too could do better in finding common ground The two nations have almost defined themselves by their staunch opposition to one another They became enemies almost instantly upon gaining independence in 1947 from imperial Britain and have since fought three fullscale wars over various issues including competing claims to the Himalayan region of Kashmir that sits between them Just this week their troops have hurled mortar shells and firing guns at one another across the Kashmir border with civilian casualties in double digits The Nobel Committees chairman Thorbjoern Jagland acknowledged his panel gave the prize to Yousafzai and Satyarthi partly to nudge the two countries together though he cautioned that the impact of the award should not be overestimated You can see that there is a lot of extremism coming from this part of the world It is partly coming from the fact that young people dont have a future They dont have education They dont have a job Jagland told The Associated Press We want to show that people in all religions can come together in a common cause The Indian winner immediately spoke about the potential to bridge old divides About Malala Satyarthi said I will invite her in a new fight for peace in our region He also said this years choice to award one person from each of the nucleararmed neighbors in South Asia made a great statement from the Nobel committee looking at the present scenarios between India and Pakistan This would not be the first time the Peace Prize has apparently engaged in this kind of political engineering In 2009 the committee awarded Barack Obama after the US president visited Middle Eastern nations estranged during the previous Bush administration Fifteen years earlier the award went to the trio of Yitzhak Rabin Yasser Arafat and Shimon Peres after an apparent breakthrough in IsraeliPalestinian peace talks though it never led to a deal And in 1996 the committee awarded Timorese Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo and Jos RamosHorta which many believe was critical in the peaceful cessation of East Timor from Indonesia in 2001 Often the committee tries to bring people in conflict together and see how they can build new bridges said Oslobased Nobel historian Oeivind Stenersen It tries to find people seeking new ways and solutions in difficult conflicts he said This years choice makes sense because the committee has been able to combine a lot of themes including a brotherhood between India and Pakistan They have done this in a very clever way But others said it wasnt likely to work It is tempting to see the Nobel Peace Prize announcement as a nuanced message to Pakistan and India to stop shelling each other across the border and start protecting children said Londonbased writer and human rights activist Salil Tripathi Whether that will sway the hardliners on both sides is of course a different question Independent Pakistani political analyst Hasan Askari Rizvi in Lahore said the nations animosity was so deeply rooted that I dont see any positive impact of the award on two societies especially while battles continued along the Kashmiri border Still the two countries have much in common    and much of what they have in common is not good Both India and Pakistan today face serious challenges in lifting their people out of poverty though each is beset by its own challenges in doing so India a bubbling democracy with a fastgrowing economy has been overwhelmed by the scale by which it needs to improve peoples lives with a 12 billion population that is still growing Pakistan with a gross domestic product equal to just a quarter Indias stock exchange daily trade is much further behind in generating power building infrastructure and establishing security It is also widely seen as being controlled by an entrenched and opaque military establishment often accused of cozying up to militant jihadists And as was underscored by Fridays award child labor and abuse are widespread and largely ignored in both India and Pakistan Satyarthi has been at the forefront of a global movement to end child slavery and exploitative child labor since 1980 and has led the rescue of tens of thousands of child slaves and developed a successful model for their education and rehabilitation He has also survived several attempts on his life Malala who now lives with her family in the British city of Birmingham was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman in Pakistan for insisting that girls as well as boys have the right to an education Surviving several operations with the help of British medical care she continued both her activism and her studies The nature of the work is quiet because it doesnt involve any violence any strident protests or noisy demonstrations said Ashis Nandy political psychologist and social theorist with the Delhibased Center for the Study of Developing Society These children dont have any vote so its very difficult to politicize this issue In its early days the peace prize was given for efforts to end or prevent armed conflicts Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel said it should go to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses The committee has interpreted those instructions differently over time widening the concept of peace work to include efforts to improve human rights fight poverty clean up the environment    and this year to promote childrens rights With the subtext as well of bringing India and Pakistan a bit closer together The Nobel Committee has shown a lot of imagination Nandy said I hope both sides see this as an opportunity to open up though Im afraid it will turn into the usual nationalist claptrap ___ Associated Press writers Karl Ritter in Stockholm Mark Lewis in Oslo Danica Kirka in London Muneeza Naqvi in New Delhi Zarar
