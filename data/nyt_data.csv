NYT,http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/a-surprise-and-a-reversal-on-edible-marijuana/,Colorado legalized the growing selling smoking and eating of recreational marijuana more than 10 months ago but it still hasnt resolved some major questions about how this new market is supposed to workThe Associated Press reported on Monday that the state Health Department was proposing to ban nearly all forms of edible marijuana to make it easier to keep children from overdosing The proposal was one of several ideas presented to a statesponsored working group considering safety regulations for the marijuana industryBut health officials quickly backed away from the plan after the AP article appeared As the Denver Post reported edibles account for nearly half of the states cannabis business Forcing all those soda and candymakers out of business or underground would be a headspinning retreat for Colorados worldleading legalization experimentIt would also seem to clearly violate the Constitutional amendment overwhelmingly approved by Colorado voters to make marijuana in its many forms legal and to regulate it like alcoholAs The Post also makes clear it is proving difficult to come up with simple surefire rules about the size look potency and potential risk of edibles Everyone seems to agree that regulation is desirable but how is that supposed to happen By airbrushing warnings on individual gummy candies By making all marijuana chocolates a telltale shade of gray Its easy to see why some health officials thought the simplest thing to do with edibles would be to just get rid of themThe problem is that its too late for that There seems little chance that Colorado will impose what Twitter jokesters have been calling Maureens Law after the Times oped columnist Maureen Dowd who had a bad night in a Denver hotel after eating marijuanainfused candyBesides for all the concern opponents have not much evidence to show that edible marijuana is a publichealth crisisHalloween is nearly here Parents in Colorado and the other legalization state Washington have been hearing warnings about adulterated candies and stoned trickortreaters Next month we will know how much of that the fear was justified,2014-10-21T15:50:24Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/us/for-marijuana-a-second-wave-of-votes-to-legalize.html,KEIZER Ore   Two years after voters in Colorado and Washington State broke the ice as the first states to legalize sales of recreational marijuana to adults residents of Oregon Alaska and Washington DC will vote next week on ballot measures patterned on those of the two pioneers People on both sides of the issue say these initiatives could determine whether there will be a national tide of legalizationA changing political landscape has weakened antimarijuana efforts As the libertarian movement in the Republican Party has gained force with leaders like Senator Rand Paul Republican of Kentucky supporting decriminalization of marijuana and others going even further an anchor of the conservative opposition to legalization has erodedAnd Democrats have found that supporting legalization  once an invitation to be labeled soft on crime  no longer carries the risk it once did as public discussion of prison overcrowding and law enforcement budgets has reframed the issueNational groups that have long advocated legalization have provided labor and money along with help from a legal marijuana industry that did not exist in 2012 The old antidrug coalition has struggled to find traction and money Supporters of legalization have outdone opponents fundraising here in Oregon by more than 25 to 1 and in Alaska by about 9 to 1The support coalition is definitely broader and the opposition has splintered said Corey Cook an associate professor of politics at the University of San Francisco who follows the marijuana debateThe contrast between the pro and antilegalization forces was apparent on a recent day in Oregon In downtown Portland scruffy hipsters with clipboards buttonholed passersby registering voters and urging them to vote yes on Measure 91 while political consultants put the final touches on a 2 million ad barrageNearby opponents organized one of their major events in Keizer a suburb of Salem the state capital Titled Marijuana and Our Youth the session included two hours of PowerPoints and passionate denunciations of the drug But no one even mentioned Measure 91 Audience participants and organizers many of them from governmentfunded nonprofit groups involved in drug treatment services were afraid of violating laws that ban politicking with public moneyOpponents were by their own admission late in forming a united organization and their campaign had only about 10000 for advertising with spots running on two Portland radio stations starting last weekendTheyve done a pretty good job of shutting everybody up said Joshua K Marquis the district attorney in Clatsop County and an opponent of legalization referring to the pro91 forcesThe prolegalization campaigns in Oregon and Alaska are financed largely by national organizations In Alaska 84 percent of the 867000 raised by legalization proponents at Yes on Ballot Measure 2 has come from the Marijuana Policy Project a group based in Washington DC with an advisory board that includes actors musicians and politicians including Gary Johnson the Libertarian Party candidate for president in 2012 Opponents to legalization in Alaska have raised only 97000In Oregon the Drug Policy Alliance based in New York and backed by the billionaire investor George Soros has led the charge contributing at least 780000 this year according to state records making up about 35 percent of the cash raised by the main committee supporting legalizationMarijuanarelated businesses or investors in Colorado Washington and California have contributed at least 60000 Contributors included OpenVAPE a company based in Denver that sells products for consuming concentrates like hash oil Privateer Holdings a marijuana investment firm in Seattle and Vicente Sederberg which calls itself The Marijuana Law FirmThere has been some wellfunded opposition to legalization especially in Florida where voters will decide whether to become the first state in the South to allow marijuana for certain medical uses There Sheldon G Adelson a casino executive from Las Vegas has contributed 5 million to opponents of medical marijuana about 86 percent of the total raised by the main committee fighting the legislationBut in Oregon there has been no sugar daddy as Mr Marquis the county prosecutor put it Opponents have raised only about 179000Initiative 71 in Washington DC would allow residents to possess up to two ounces of marijuana for personal use and grow up to six cannabis plants at home Measure 91 in Oregon would allow possession by adults of up to eight ounces of marijuana and four plantsBallot Measure 2 in Alaska would allow adult possession of one ounce and six plantsSupporters of legalization in Oregon and Alaska said that money was crucial to overcoming what they say was years of incorrect information and distortion by law enforcement and antidrug groups about marijuanas risksThe opposition made good traction for 50 years and it was built around locking people up A massive industry was built around it said Richard Branson the entrepreneur who founded Virgin Group and a member of the Drug Policy Alliances international honorary boardOpponents said they were facing for the first time an emerging industrial complexThis is not about independent Alaskans smoking marijuana in their homes but a commercialization and industrialization of an industry said Charles Fedullo a spokesman for Big Marijuana Big Mistake which opposes Ballot Measure 2 in AlaskaChanges required for the meeting about marijuana and youth here in Keizer opponents of legalization say offers a case study in the tough new tactics of prolegalization groupsA few weeks before the Marijuana and Our Youth meeting legalization supporters pointed out to federal and state authorities that a small drug treatment center funded by government grants was sponsoring a tour of the state by Kevin A Sabet a cofounder of a national antilegalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana They reminded all parties that federal and state laws prohibited the use of public funds to influence electionsThe State of Oregon agreed and issued a stern warning that any group receiving public money  a list that included 70 counties tribes schools and nonprofit agencies that provide drug treatment or substanceabuse prevention programs  had best tread carefullyThe result was a sudden silence in the antidrug contingent and a muted meeting here in Keizer Even though private funds were substituted to avoid the appearance of impropriety talk of Measure 91 organizers said was taken off the table out of concern for jobs and future government grants A central constituency in the opposition heavy on health care professionals was stifledBoth sides said the new terrain offered a glimpse toward the next wave of states notably California where supporters are gearing up for a vote in 2016 But there are strange historical echoes too Alaska and Oregon were both pioneers of marijuana law in the 1970s Oregons Legislature debated full legalization in 1973 and ended up passing the nations first law decriminalizing possession of small amounts Alaskas Supreme Court held in 1975 that possession of marijuana in ones home was protected by constitutional privacy lawWhether the antidrug coalition of the past is dead or just sleeping both sides agree that the old arguments no longer workTodays parents are yesterdays children who were smoking marijuana and have personal experience and therefore the kind of advertisement which shows fried eggs doesnt really cut it with them Mr Soros said in an interview this year He was referring to an antidrug television campaign that showed a sizzling egg in a pan and the tagline This is your brain on drugsBut the pressure is also on proponents they say not to fall short because every new state is a kind of test caseIf we win I think it shows that public opinion has decisively changed  weve won in two election cycles said Peter Zuckerman a spokesman for New Approach Oregon the main group supporting legalization If we lose I think it becomes much harder he said We have to maintain the momentumProfessor Sabet of the department of psychiatry in the College of Medicine at the University of Florida founded his antilegalization group with Patrick J Kennedy a former Democratic congressman from Rhode Island He said an interview that on the surface the fight against legalization probably looks unwinnable hereIt looks bad  I want to be on the other team he said laughing Turning serious Professor Sabet said that experiences in Washington and Colorado were exposing flaws in legal marijuana  from greater exposure to young people to questions of highway safety  that he thinks will turn off many voters even though opponents of the ballot measures lack the money to shout their messageLegalization in practice has been the biggest enemy of legalization he said,2014-10-29T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/us/new-scrutiny-on-sweets-with-ascent-of-marijuana-in-colorado.html,DENVER   As Halloween approached the Denver Police Department and a marijuanastore owner teamed up to film a public service video that could exist only in this weird new world of legalized potMarijuana they cautioned parents of trickortreaters does not always look like marijuana More and more these days it can mimic Sour Patch Kids Jolly Ranchers and gummy bears and the police urged parents to doublecheck their childrens Halloween haul for any suspiciouslooking candies that might be infused with marijuanaTheres really no way to tell the difference Patrick Johnson the owner of Urban Dispensary says in the video He added Its best just to toss that stuff into the trashTo some marijuana advocates the warning belongs with shadowy urban legends about poisoned chocolates and candy bars spiked with razor blades There have not been any reported cases of marijuanalaced treats being passed out on Halloween here and edible marijuana comes in drab packages that look nothing like regular candy Still the Halloween message underscored a growing concern among parents groups and regulators that the abundant new varieties of legal edible marijuana just look too much like regular foodSince recreational marijuana sales began here in January edible pot has become a top seller at dispensaries across Colorado a sweet and tasty way for wary firsttimers to sample marijuana or for people to get high without coughing and reeking of smoke But a spate of accidental ingestions by children and adults and two deaths tied to edibles this year have prompted widespread calls to clamp down on the edible corner of the marijuana marketWhile some companies are making mandarinflavored sodas and rich darkchocolate bars infused with the drug advocates for tighter marijuana regulation say that others are simply coating brightly colored bulk candy and childfriendly breakfast cereals with cannabis oil and selling it at a huge markup And critics argue that even seasoned marijuana consumers are getting sick or losing control after eating marijuana snacks that proved far more potent than they had realized A single candy bar or soda could be packed with enough THC  the major psychoactive chemical in marijuana  to serve 10 peopleUnder new rules approved by state regulators some potent candies that once contained 100milligram doses of THC are being pared back to 10 milligrams a serving the amount that has been designated as a discrete dose And starting next February more edibles will come in childproof packages and will be wrapped up in plastic and foil sheets similar to those that encase prescription pillsBut some officials think the new rules do not go far enoughThis month Colorados public health department went so far as to recommend a ban on almost all forms of edible marijuana from brownies to cookies and chewy candies saying their proliferation was confusing consumers and baiting children who could not tell the difference The proposal has not gained much traction but it showed the deep divisions between marijuana makers and public health officials who are now sparring over how to package edibles whether they need clearer labels and markings and exactly how strictly they should be regulatedJulie Dooley and a business partner started making marijuanainfused treats years before voters in Colorado and Washington State became the first to make marijuana legal for adult recreational users It helped ease their health problems and worked for women with anxiety problems These users wanted to consume discreetly around their children so baking with cannabisrich butter seemed like an ideal choice Today Ms Dooleys company Julies Baked Goods sells granola granola bars sunflower seeds and chocolates infused with cannabis to more than 30 dispensaries around the stateMs Dooley said she was aghast at the proposal to ban her granola and said it appeared illegal under Amendment 64 the voterapproved measure that enshrined marijuana legalization in Colorados Constitution But it also showed that regulators did not understand the industry she saidThey clearly did not consider why we created edibles in the first place she said We believe wholeheartedly that this is a medicineShe and other marijuanabusiness owners said the fear surrounding edibles had outstripped reality During the first half of the year emergencyroom doctors at Childrens Hospital Colorado raised alarms after treating nine children who had accidentally eaten marijuana  more than the entire number of such cases in 2013 Since the end of May the hospital has had five additional cases of children sickened by eating marijuanaTheres no crisis theres no emergency Ms Dooley said The fear is so huge right nowBut officials with Colorados poisoncontrol center say that calls about young children exposed to marijuana had risen from 11 in 2010 to 26 last year after recreational marijuana was legalized but before retail sales began Adults too have been fooled In August seven people attending Denvers county fair said they accidentally ate marijuanalaced chocolates from a vendor at the fairs inaugural Pot Pavilion who had assured them the candies were marijuanafreeWe cannot tell which is infused and which is not said Gina Carbone a founding member of Smart Colorado which advocates tighter controls to keep marijuana away from childrenOne Colorado company has begun wooing worried parents with 15 marijuanatesting kits that use a THCsensitive solution to quickly determine whether an innocuouslooking cookie or candy is packing a hidden punchAnd some advocates say edibles should have a mark or stamp that identifies them unmistakably as marijuana the same way the Hersheys brand is stamped right on a chocolate bar or how MM candies and Jelly Belly jelly beans are each airbrushed with an insigniaBut makers of edibles have resisted the idea saying it would cost tens of thousands of dollars to buy the necessary equipment raising the price of edibles and potentially driving more customers out of the stores and back onto the black market And there are practical problems they say How do you put a unique stamp on a soft toffee chew or a package of granola And some makers say that branding a chocolate bar as MARIJUANA might actually have perverse effects making it more attractive to curious childrenLindsay Topping the marketing director of Dixie Elixirs and Edibles a Denverbased maker of marijuanainfused drinks and candies said the company was already preparing a new line of childresistant packages But ultimately she said the safety of an edible depended largely on the customerI cant control how a parent stores this she said Its out of my

was 16 he had been using medical marijuana since 2009 to relieve the painful spasms that jolted his body But he smoked mostly at night and said marijuana had never hurt his performance answering customer calls for a Colorado satellitetelevision providerSo when his employer Dish Network asked Mr Coats to take a random drug screen he was not surprised when the test came back positive for marijuana He told his bosses why but when he got to work the following week he said my card wouldnt open up the door He was fired for violating the companys drugfree workplace rules despite having a medical marijuana cardThere are a lot of people out there who need jobs can do a good job but in order for them to live their lives they have to have this said Mr Coats who is 35 A person can drink all night long be totally hung over the next day and go to work and theres no problem with itBut when it comes to marijuana Mr Coats and other users are discovering that marijuanas recent strides toward the legal and cultural mainstream are running aground at the office Even as 23 states allow medical or recreational marijuana employment experts say that most businesses are keeping their drugfree policies The result is a clash between a culture that increasingly accepts marijuana and companies that will fire employees who use itEven in Colorado and Washington the countrys most

welder cautions that they are a zerotolerance company including marijuanaEmployers and business groups say the screenings identify drugabusing workers create a safer workplace lower their insurance costs and in some cases are required by law But marijuana advocates say the prohibitions amount to discrimination either against people using marijuana to treat a medical condition or against people who smoke it because they simply have the legal right to do so off the clock and away from the officeIt wasnt like I was getting high on the job Mr Coats said I would smoke right before I go to bed and that little bit would help me get through my daysOn Sept 30 he will take that argument before the Colorado Supreme Court in a lawsuit challenging his 2010 firing For years courts in Colorado and across the country have ruled against marijuana users saying that companies have the right to create their own drug policies But legal experts say that if Mr Coats prevails  he lost 21 in an appellate ruling  his case could transform how businesses must treat marijuana usersMr Coatss lawyer Michael Evans argues that Mr Coatss use of medical marijuana should fall under a state law that prohibits companies from firing workers for legal offduty activities that might rankle an employer Dish Network argues that smoking marijuana can hardly be considered legal because it breaks federal lawIf Dish

contracts because they no longer complied with federal drugfree workplace lawsAfter Colorado voted in 2012 to allow adults to buy sell and grow their own recreational marijuana scarcely any businesses relaxed their own rules according to a survey by the Mountain States Employers Council which represents 3500 companies Seventyone percent left their drugtesting policies in place and 21 percent actually imposed stricter rulesPeople were scared they were going to have a stoned work force said Curtis Graves a staff lawyer for the groupA survey by Quest Diagnostics which conducts millions of drug tests across the country found that positive results for marijuana rose in both Colorado and Washington in the year after legalization measures passed In Colorado the number of urine samples testing positive for marijuana rose to 23 percent in 2013 from 192 percent in 2012 In Washington the rates rose to 238 percent from 194A positive test result can derail a career say people who have

NYT,http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/when-the-message-on-marijuana-is-still-just-say-no/,As I wrote last month marijuana and its use has changed The laws around it are in flux As of now marijuana for medical usage is legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia two of those states Colorado and Washington have legalized recreational use as well for people 21 and over The stuff itself usually green leafy and intended for smoking is increasingly available in a form that I have also written about before It may be a drug but it can look like candy  So how I asked do we talk about the maybelegalforsomepeopleinsomecontextsbutnotforyou drug that can now be munched smoked or sipped As Julie Scelfo described in A Familys Truth About Marijuana Depends on the Family parents are finding different answers to this question up to and including smoking with teenagers and helping teens 18 and over to secure marijuana legally with medical marijuana cards A parent who is or has been a user of marijuana may see it differently than a parent who has not Just as some parents have always preferred to take a more lenient stance on alcohol use or even the law than others some parents will be similarly lenient regarding marijuanaBut there remain excellent reasons for taking the classic 80s JustSayNo approach to marijuana use in teenagers While the legalization of marijuana for adults or for medical use in some states contributes to a perception that it is safe for all its effects on developing brains are less clear Recent research has found a correlation between regular marijuana use at younger ages and impaired neural connectivity executive function and memory and poor grades and school performance although the question of causation is particularly murky in this area Teens who are already struggling with brain function or school performance may be more likely to embrace marijuana use Colorados Dont Be a Lab Rat campaign tackles the lack of clarity head on asking Whos going to risk their brains to find out once and for all what marijuana really doesBeyond the possible neural changes marijuana use can have big consequences in a teens life Its still illegal in every state for teenagers to use marijuana Many high school sports and organized activities take a strict notolerance view of marijuana and alcohol Students who even attend a party where the drug is used may find themselves off the team or out of the band College sports teams including those at the University of Colorado Boulder often take a similar approachIf your teenager isnt a joiner he may be a traveler A marijuana conviction even a minor one can mean no visa to countries from Canada to China Marijuana use even without a conviction can end job prospects with the military police and fire departments or the Federal Bureau of Investigation and disqualify a student from government internships Many jobs and even colleges and graduate schools take past drug use or evidence of it through perhaps social media seriously Your teenager or any proponent of legalization can argue that those limits are shortsighted and should change but for now those are the facts The choice to use marijuana now can limit later life choicesThis conversation is also a different one for parents of minority children Statistically white teenagers can hope that police and other authorities will look the other way when it comes to marijuana use black teenagers in particular often cannot Blacks are routinely singled out for marijuana arrests Minorities are more likely to suffer any possible consequences for its use and it use can become a pretext for more and harsher police scrutiny of a teenAll that said Childrens Hospital Colorado reminds parents to have conversations not lectures Children make choices all the time that wouldnt be our choices for them and families regroup and move forward Listen to your childs perspective make sure youre having an ongoing conversation around marijuana ask questions and above all make sure your child knows that if he feels unsafe at any moment he can call As the laws around marijuana use change and with them the ways we consider drug use in the larger culture that conversation with teenagers will change as well Parents will also find themselves talking about the ways different families approach marijuana use you might not share a pipe with your son his best friends father may feel differently Well face new conversations with each other about whats appropriate Few of us would ask a fellow parent not to drink a beer in the presence of our children we may feel differently about that pipe and differently still about a serving of THClaced chocolate medical or recreational Like the conversations were having with our kids this one

NYT,http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/a-familys-truth-about-marijuana-depends-on-the-family/,What is the truth about marijuana As long as Ive been an adult Ive known people who smoke marijuana and they certainly dont fit the stereotype of skater dude or hippie holdoverInstead they have included the director of a medical charity an investment banker the mother of a severely disabled child an athletic trainer a salesman a retiree a small business owner a chef and no small number of waiters athletes and tech professionalsAll of these people who live all over the country broke the law when they got high but are otherwise lawabiding citizens They hold steady jobs They pay taxes Some are Republicans Most are parents And even if you dont realize it you know them or someone just like them tooSeeing these folks use the drug occasionally while contributing positively to their families and society shaped my belief that  marijuana should be legal for adults and taxed and regulated in a manner similar to other intoxicants like tobacco and alcohol But over dinner earlier this year a friend who I respect very much argued vehemently that using marijuana was a bad thing could be a gateway drug to more serious substances and should remain illegal and offlimits This wasnt just a casual opinion My friend is a clinical director in emergency psychiatry at one of the nations largest psychiatric emergency rooms and has for more than a decade worked on the front lines where drug abuse intersects with crime and misfortuneAnd yet despite the negative effects of the drug for some another psychiatrist who works with adults and adolescents in Brooklyn told me that many of her patients expressed the wish that they could treat their anxiety with marijuana because it thoroughly relieves all their symptoms and has fewer side effects than the legal prescription alternativesSo what is the right thing to believe  and to teach my children  here And does it matter that my friend who argued so vehemently against marijuana did so after ordering a second sidecar cocktail And what if we live in a state where marijuana is illegal but have family members who live where recreational use is approved In Education Life I explored how parents are grappling with these issues and took a closeup look at five different parenting approaches Across the country parents have wildly divergent ideas about what to teach their children with some insisting they Just Say No and others offering to roll joints and make nachos And as hard is it is to teach children about alcohol despite uniform laws across the country parents have an even tougher time with marijuana given such disparate messages from different states and from state and federal authorities But in the stories of these five families we see that marijuana is but one issue among many that parents are concerned about from binge drinking to sexual assault to prescription drug abuse and that Americas drug landscape is far too complex today to rely on simplistic aphorisms Being more casual or accepting of marijuana use is also a privilege of being white and middleupper class While illegal use of marijuana is rarely enforced among whites blacks are routinely singled out for marijuana arrests forcing black families to have entirely different conversations with their childrenThrough my reporting and through personal experience I came to see  the truth about marijuana is that like most things there is no one truth It can be good and it can be bad and which depends on how and when it is used how often and by whom In a family with a history of drug abuse marijuana can be deadly In a family with severe anxiety it can be a lifesaver So what should you say to your children That depends on you your values and of course your child Read more about marijuana on Motherlode When the Stance on Marijuana Is Still Just Say No When Marijuana Looks Like Candy Not Drugs What to Do When Your Child Wants Marijuana Stocks and That SixServing Bar of Marijuana Chocolate My Son Ate It,2014-11-03T13:12:24Z,drugs

was hit by Stewarts car during a confrontation at a dirttrack race Aug 9A grand jury in Ontario County NY voted not to indict Stewart Wards family was considering its legal options saying This matter is not at restThe county district attorney R Michael Tantillo asked a grand jury to determine if there was evidence to support a charge of manslaughter in the second degree or criminally negligent homicide against Stewart but the panel found no aberrational drivingTantillo said a toxicology report revealed that Ward was under the influence of marijuana at the time of the accident  enough to impair judgmentI respect everything the district attorney and sheriffs office did to thoroughly investigate this tragic accident Stewart said in a statement released by a team spokesman While the process was long and emotionally difficult it allowed for all the facts of the accident to be identified and knownWhile much of the attention has been on me its important to remember a young man lost his life Kevin Ward Jrs family and friends will always be in my thoughts and prayersStewart a threetime Nascar champion races openwheeled sprint cars as a hobby and was at Canandaigua Motorsports Park a small dirt track in upstate New York for an event Aug 9 the night before a Nascar Sprint Cup race at nearby Watkins Glen International During the sprint car race Stewarts car appeared to bump or cut off Wards car as the two drove into a turn Wards car hit the outside wall and spun bringing out a yellow caution flag that slowed the fieldWard 20 a former rookie of the year in the Empire Super Sprint from Port Leyden NY left his racecar and walked onto the track to confront Stewart As Stewart drove past his car hit Ward Ward was declared dead at a hospital shortly afterwardThe grand jury heard testimony from about two dozen witnesses including drivers track employees and two accident reconstruction experts The grand jury reviewed two videos and photographs of the accident deliberating for less than an hour before coming to a decision Tantillo would not say if Stewart testifiedAn affirmative vote of at least 12 members of the 23member grand jury would have been needed to indict Stewart Tantillo did not reveal the vote tally but said he believed the grand jury blamed Ward for the accidentThe grand jury was never tasked with the responsibility of anything other than to determine whether there was enough evidence to file charges against Tony Stewart Tantillo said in a news conference They were not considering whether anybody else was at fault However I am sure from their deliberations and discussions that the fact that Kevin Ward was observed running basically down twothirds of the track into a hot track in the middle of other cars that were still racing played a big big factor in their decisionTantillo said that Stewart did not change course as he passed Ward and that the fishtail movement of his racecar seen on a widely viewed video of the accident came at impact and was a result of his cars hitting WardWhen reached by phone Pam Ward Kevins mother read a prepared statement maintaining that Stewarts actions were dangerousOur son got out of his car during caution while the race was suspended she said All other vehicles were reducing speed and not accelerating except for Tony Stewart who intentionally tried to intimidate Kevin by accelerating and sliding his car towards him causing this tragedy The focus should be on the actions of Mr Stewart and not my son This matter is not at rest and we will pursue all remedies in fairness to KevinThe suggestions that Stewarts car accelerated and slid were not supported by the information released WednesdayWard would not say whether the family was pursuing a civil suit against StewartAsked about the revelation that her son was found to be impaired by marijuana she reiterated The focus should be on Tony Stewarts actions and not KevinsTantillo said Stewart was not tested for drugs or alcohol because the police officers who interviewed him determined it was not necessaryStewart an owner of the premier StewartHaas Racing team went into seclusion after the accident missing three Cup races before returning to the circuit at Atlanta on Aug 31 He did not qualify for the 16car field for the Chase for the Sprint CupAlthough Nascar was not associated with the sprint car race its officials announced a rules change after the fatal episode Drivers are now required to remain in their cars after accidents until safety workers arrive unless they are at risk from fire or smokeThe episode has cast a pall over Nascar and taken some of the focus away from its annual playoffThere are no winners in tragedy the Nascar spokesman Brett Jewkes said in a statement after the grand jury decision Our thoughts and prayers remain with the Kevin Ward Jr family and Tony Stewart as they all cope with this tragic incident at Canandaigua Motorsports Park This has been a difficult time for everyone

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/fashion/in-colorado-a-rebranding-of-pot-inc-marijuana.html,Step into a Colorado pot dispensary at random and youll long for the luxuries of the DMVMetal bars cover windows Vinyl signs are tacked to walls Guys in hoodie sweatshirts greet you from behind the counter Even the act of ordering the product itself is borderline absurd What grown adult can respectfully walk into a store and ask for an eighth of Green Krack and a nub of Big Buddha Cheese pleaseBut that experience is changing thanks to a new breed of entrepreneur in Colorado  young ambitious and often female  that is trying to reach a more sophisticated clientele in everything from language to packaging to social eventsWere weeding out the stoners said Olivia Mannix the 25yearold cofounder of a startup called Cannabrand an advertising agency devoted exclusively to marketing marijuana We want to show the world that normal professional successful people consume cannabisColorado became the first of two states to legalize recreational marijuana sales this year paving the way for millions in tax revenue and a new kind of consumer That is why on a recent weekend Ms Mannix and her cofounder Jennifer DeFalco were camped out in Aspen for a potthemed and potinduced brainstorming sessionThe gathering was billed as a writers retreat but mostly it involved talking They discussed edible marijuana and flavor pairings over a meal prepared by Melissa Parks a chef trained at Le Cordon Bleu THCinfused truffles optional They contemplated strain hybrids and herbal remedies with commentary from a selfdescribed cannabis sommelier as well as the gangapreneurs who have flocked to Colorado since pot was made legal not wanting to miss out on the socalled green rushAnd of course they talked about branding How can the pot industry shed its stoner stigmaPot has practically gone mainstream A majority of Americans now supports legalization efforts There are coming ballot measures in Alaska Oregon and the District of Columbia Yet when it comes to pot culture the industry remains comically rudimentaryDispensaries still look like underground abortion clinics Ms Mannix said Advertisements are full of women with whipped cream straddling bongs Ms DeFalco said And the old stoner stereotype endures lazy mostly men rolling joints in their parents basement covered in Doritos crumbsThe average person when you say the word marijuana they have a visceral reaction said Paul Armentano the deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws one of the oldest of such groups Theres a reason the alcohol industry spends tens of millions of dollars to advertise and market their products Successful branding pays offSo where do branding specialists begin For starters they would like to stop calling it pot thank you very much Better to call it cannabis the plants scientific name Less aggressive Rather than smoke one consumes the product Subtler For those in the business  or cannabusiness as its known  9to5 chic is crucial said the Cannabrand owners no sweats no tiedye no Bob Marley TshirtsWhile smoking or rather consuming on the job seems to be par for the course its not without a certain decorum a daintylooking joint or perhaps a vaporizer pen like an ecigarette for weed that slides neatly in a purse or pocketCultural crossover is already well underway in the state The Colorado Symphony made headlines this summer when it began a series of shows called Classically Cannabis in which freespirited music lovers were invited to BYOPThroughout Denver there are monthly cocktail and cannabis events put on by a local party planner as well as a weekly painting course called Puff Pass and Paint hosted in a charming Victorian studio  an effort to as Heidi Keyes the cheerful 28yearold instructor put it blend Mary Jane and MonetCannabrand recently rolled out a yoga class called Vape and Vinyasa The company is working on an app that will allow users to place their pot order online and skip the line as they describe it like an OpenTable for weedThe thing is said Ms DeFalco who is the duos creative director baby boomers are smoking stayathome moms are smoking business executives are smoking But for so long theyve done it behind closed doors We want to bring them out of the shadowsAnd they want to keep them out there Meg Sanders the chief executive of a network of dispensaries called Mindful recently hired Cannabrand to do an overhaul of her company formerly called GaiaThe new name was chosen to reflect the brand philosophy she said but also to modernize its look  in everything from logo to the uniforms worn by employees to the dispensaries shabby insides Many of the marketing materials do not even mention the word cannabis or any other word for potIve heard time and time again I walk into a dispensary and I feel like Im walking into a stoners basement said Ms Sanders during a tour through the expansive factory where her plants are harvested It also acts as the companys headquarters So we really had to think How do we package our product in a way that wherever we go  whether its the most liberal or the most conservative clientele  people look at us and think I get it Im not offended by this Its not Joeys weed shop you knowMs Mannix and Ms DeFalco studied together at the University of Colorado at Boulder though neither has a business background Ms Mannix studied communications Ms DeFalco advertising They are young working overtime trying to project a business savvy but theyve also filled a hole in the industry that the mainstream business sector has yet to touchFor example the women were among the sponsors of a recent career fair called CannaSearch to recruit for some of the 500 open pot jobs in the state The jobs included dispensary workers yes but also horticulturalists social media managers and marketing executives The applicants showed up  among them Csuite level executives said Ms Sanders  but not a single mainstream brand had even a sponsorship presenceThere is a huge untapped market here said Ashley Picillo a 26yearold former teacher who runs a cannabis events agency and was the fairs coorganizer Its about reaching nonconsumers Women Young people Business professionals Grandmothers and soccer moms People like meIn

anywhere On the ground the marijuana dispensaries are the most visible signs of the new world of weed They are mostly small storefronts sometimes hard to notice until you realize what signs like Wellness Center and Natural Remedies are telling you Stoner culture flourishes openly in clubs and the backofthebook ads in Westword the alternative paper in Denver But there is very little inyourfaceness to the brickandmortar cannabis trade The growing takes place out of sight  in unmarked warehouses along the South Platte River in Denver for example and in peoples homes Unless the very existence of a sign saying Denver Kush Club offends you youre not likely to be appalled by the openness of cannabis cultureBut if youre looking to indulge retail shops are easy to find Tourists are flocking to gawk and discuss cannabis strains and effects with dispensary salespeople called budtenders who are no doubt delighted to find themselves so employable While marijuana legalization is about ending hypocrisy repairing the criminal justice system favoring facts over hysteria its also about turning users into consumers Colorados cannabis advocates and entrepreneurs have in classic American fashion gotten down to businessA bunch of ganjapreneurs took over the Colorado Convention Center for a twoday summit sponsored by the National Cannabis Industry Association when I was there in midJune I saw two sets of blonde dreadlocks and average tattoo density otherwise the scene was all business casual polo shirts and pencil skirts smartphones and networking Drug dealers dont fit the stereotype when they are discussing human resources media relations tax regulation and lobbying or when their companies have names like Envirotech Greenhouse Solutions EZTrim and CannLabsPhotoPipes for sale at the Denver PrideFest in Civic Center Park in JuneCredit Lawrence DownesAmbitions were high but the scale was human there is no Philip Morris or Walmart of cannabis yet The industry is young enough for its capitalists to still be steeped in marijuana idealism The summiteers sounded sincere ironyfree even poignant Even though they were there to cash inPhotoCareful trellising and sophisticated grow lights keep plants healthy in the LivWell warehouseCredit Lawrence DownesThe biggest player I met though not at the summit was a Denver entrepreneur named Ben Burkhardt who wants his cannabis business LivWell to succeed on the Budweiser model delivering vast quantities of a pretty good product He told me his 120000squarefoot operation near downtown Denver is the largest legal marijuana farm in the world with three levels under grow lights that bring hot sunshine indoors I watched his employees planting potting and expertly trimming plants with scissors I saw a guy using rubber gloves and razor blades to cut and pot clones I saw machines in his kitchen mixing chocolate and oils to make potent little candies I met a marijuana photographer named Ry Prichard who shoots for High Times and The Denver Post He and I sat in a Burger King where he showed me dozens of lovingly shot photos on his laptop like baby pictures of leaves and buds and bits of marijuana concentrates with names like shatter and budder He belongs to a subculture of devoted users who smoke dabs of concentrates using glass pipes and butane torches Its the marijuana equivalent of doing shots but without the cirrhosisRy told me something amazing He said that the preferred tool for lighting dabs is a crme brle torch and that if I went to the Bed Bath  Beyond in Denver I would find a dab island a pile of torches stacked beside glass bowls digital scales vacuum sealing machines and plastic bags  everything for the dabbing lifestyle At the chains store on First Avenue it was just like he said a mountain of torches 135 of them otherwise unmarked and unnoticed by shoppersRy also told me that he was named for the guitarist Ry Cooder which I think is one of the coolest things about himI saw some troubling things too The best available responses to the edibles problem  more education clearer packaging more parental responsibility  are sound but not entirely reassuring And while consumers might expect basic foodindustry cleanliness standards with products they smoke and eat for now they are taking their chances New health and sanitation rules to prevent problems like mold and bacteria dont take effect till the fall Another point Marijuana is supposed to be sold in childsafe envelopes After I bought some edibles in Crested Butte I gave an empty envelope to a 5yearold boy who conquered its zipper lock in about half a minute He would have been quicker but he was holding a piece of toast The federal prohibition of marijuana has created a banking crisis Mr Burkhardt says he and other business owners cant get banks to save our lives Armoredcar companies wont work with him he has to use private vehicles and be discreet He pays corporate and personal taxes in cash taking suitcases to the IRS which means a handful of people will spend the rest of the day flicking and stacking bills He feels certain that the feds will fix the banking problem eventually  after somebody gets killed in a robberyThere is another physical danger hardcore users making hash oil at home using butane as a solvent to leach the THC from carefully nurtured buds Done in a competent lab this produces concentrates with a purity up to 90 percent THC and a high that blissedout users rave about Done ineptly in a kitchen or garage it produces explosionsAdvocates response to this and other concerns more legalization not less A cheaper supply of legal concentrates makes users less inclined to risk blowing themselves upBut cheaper cannabis is also easier for teenagers to get and some advocates fear a dramatic increase in use by teenagers could stop legalization in its tracks Much is riding on the states drugprevention campaign to counter the inconveniently mixed signals that arise from normalizing what teenagers have been told all their lives is a dangerous narcoticBecause I was working I didnt inhale Nor did I chew or sip I had heard from reliable sources that edibles can really mess you up I did drop 80 on a bottle of cannabisinfused sarsaparilla elixir applecandy drops and ointment But I gave them away to some lawyers I met Colorados law against public consumption means there are few places for tourists to smoke what they buy Smoking a joint on the sidewalk wont send you to state prison but it might get you a ticket I did not risk it My direct experience boiled down to talking and listening to a lot of people taking notes and photos Looking around And sometimes smelling Parts of Colorado are definitely funkier than beforeSpending a week looking at Colorado through a marijuana lens had an odd effect Somehow it made me lose my alcohol goggles the ones that make you blind to the ubiquity of liquor in the culture at large Ours is a boozesoaked country theres no denyingI went to a Merle Haggard concert in downtown Denver after a long day at the cannabis summit Mr Haggard dedicated one song to all the drunks in the audience especially the female drunks whom he found delightful Later he sang his biggest hit Okie From Muskogee We dont smoke marijuana in Muskogee he began and people whooped to hear his legendary putdown of longhaired hippies and their cannabisThe song long ago lost its countercountercultural punch but whether Mr Haggard was being all satiric or truly in earnest I have never heard any hidden meaning or irony in his matteroffact refrain about what Okies consider the biggest thrill of all  getting drunk on grain alcoholInside the lovely Art Deco Paramount theater where the seats have cup holders audience members raised high their Pabst Blue Ribbon tall boys and sang along The song was a perfect summation of incoherence of the American drug war with its prim rejection of one relatively benign herbal drug and affection bordering on reverence for a wretchedly damaging liquid one It was an accidental anthem for legalization and we knew all the words by heart,2014-08-04T06:59:37Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/nyregion/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-biggest-pot-dealer-in-new-york-city-history.html,One day in January 2007 the disgruntled exgirlfriend of a Queens pot dealer walked unprompted into the district office of the Drug Enforcement Administration on Long Island Sitting down with an agent she bitterly gave vent Her former boyfriend the father of her child was selling weedAs a rule the drug agency isnt in the business of settling romantic scores but the woman who had shown up with her child in tow was adamant that her onetime lover was a major player in the citys wholesale marijuana trade A group of federal agents started looking into the manWhat began that day with a woman scorned unfolded over the next seven years into an investigation that went beyond the wildest imaginings of the agents assigned to it an elaborate case that led to the discovery and subsequent arrest of a surprising quarry an international criminal who is now described as the biggest marijuana dealer in New York City historyThat man a French Canadian playboy named Jimmy Cournoyer spent almost a decade selling highgrade marijuana in the city trafficking the drug through a sprawling operation that moved from fields and factories in western Canada through staging plants in suburban Montreal across the United States border at an Indian reservation and finally south to a network of distributors in New York Along the way Mr Cournoyer a martialarts enthusiast with a taste for fast cars oversaw an unlikely ensemble of underlings a company of criminals that came to include Native American smugglers Hells Angels Mexican money launderers a clothier turned cocaine dealer in Southern California and a preppy Polowearing Staten Island gangsterIt all came to an end three weeks ago when Mr Cournoyer pronounced koornWAHyay was sentenced in Brooklyn to 27 years in federal prison finally bringing to a close the investigation that emerged in 2007 from that domestic disputeThe size and sophistication of his fallen empire were unprecedented those who chased him say Starting in the mid2000s Mr Cournoyer managed the shipment of mansize bales of hydroponically grown pot across the border on motorboats and snowmobiles Nearly 1 billion of his cash was laundered through the Sinaloa drug cartel or was ferried back to Canada in pickup trucks equipped with secret traps in their radios and gas tanksWe never saw anything like this guy before said Steven L Tiscione a federal prosecutor in New York who supervised the task force that broke the case In terms of his longevity and scope and the connections he had around the world nothing nobody comes closeAt the height of his success Mr Cournoyer who is now 34 and is awaiting placement in the federal prison system drove a Porsche Cayenne and a 2 million limitededition Bugatti Veyron He was friends with Georges St Pierre a mixedmartial arts fighter and dated a lingerie model His social circle was configured such that once on a trip to Ibiza he attended the same party as Leonardo DiCaprio These circumstances could not have been more different from those of his pursuers on the task force composed of local detectives career federal agents and government prosecutors like Mr Tiscione The task force however had a lead and within a year of receiving the womans complaint the Queens dealer who was caught selling drugs was facing prosecution and became an informantOne piece of the information he provided was the alias of his Canadian supplier a man known as Cosmo whose name he said derived from his residence in the Cit Cosmo a luxury condominium in the Montreal suburb of Laval Mr Tiscione and his team eventually learned Cosmos real name by eavesdropping on his network with wiretaps and by putting pressure on other dealers but they were unaware of his lengthy history until they contacted the authorities in Laval The Canadians described Mr Cournoyer as a seasoned trafficker whose criminal career had begun at age 18 when he and his brother Joey were arrested with a stash of 11 marijuana plants at their apartmentIn 1998 Mr Cournoyer pleaded guilty in that case and was sentenced to probation But two years later he was caught again selling marijuana out of his Jeep at the Kanesatake Mohawk reservation a halfhours drive from Laval Although he pleaded guilty in that case too he escaped a serious prison term He was arrested for a third time only 12 months later On that occasion Mr Cournoyer had checked into a Hilton in Toronto planning to sell 10000 Ecstasy pills to a customer for 65000 The customer turned out to be an undercover agent As he tried to flee Mr Cournoyer was captured despite court papers say brandishing a handgun loaded with armorpiercing bulletsThe lesson he learned from prison that time was perhaps not what the authorities intended As Mr Tiscione would later write in a legal memorandum Determined to never again be found in the compromising position of physically touching narcotics Cournoyer began expanding his roster of associates and installing additional layers of subordinates between himself and the drugsAmong those subordinates was Mario Racine a fellow Canadian whom Mr Cournoyer sent to the United States in the early 2000s court papers say to manage the increasingly giant loads of marijuana flowing across the border Mr Cournoyer had met Mr Racine through Mr Racines sister Amelia the lingerie model whom he dated for several years Mr Racine organized the outfits East Coast distribution The biggest distributors were generally given up to 200 pounds of marijuana at a time with brand names like Sour Diesel which they then resold in pound quantities to smaller retail salesmenAnother top lieutenant was Patrick Paisse a onelegged Qubcois who helped Mr Cournoyer arrange a deal with the Hells Angels to drive huge loads of pot from fields in British Columbia and greenhouse factories equipped with charcoal air filters and offthegrid power systems across the border hidden beneath the tarps of tractortrailersMr Paisse pronounced pahEES also helped him make contact with a network of Native American smugglers at the St Regis Mohawk Reservation who moved their own loads south across the St Lawrence River on small boats during temperate months and on snowmobiles in winterThe reservation which sits along the border of New York State and Canada was a perfect corridor for shipping drugs to American buyers and the Native residents who worked with Mr Paisse had long experience in moving contraband like firearms and cigarettes through its skein of private docks One of the Natives who took part Kenneth Cree lived in an immense house studded with surveillance camerasBefore long court papers say the trafficking operation was pumping regular shipments of highgrade marijuana into the United States But in 2004 one of Mr Cournoyers top New York distributors stole a load worth more than 1 million souring relations with the Hells Angels who lost out on the fee to transport the drugsThat same year Mr Cournoyer crashed his Porsche killing a passenger and was imprisoned on charges related to the death Although he served only a year he was forced upon his release to live in a halfway house in Montreal In his absence his enterprise had fallen into tatters Mr Tiscione said But Mr Cournoyer managed to rebuild it meeting secretly with associates during hurried rendezvous in the Montreal subway and while on work release from the halfway house where  industrious as ever  he had found a job driving an elderly woman to her medical appointmentsThe operation was flourishing again by late 2007 when the Drug Enforcement Administration began to make inroads in its investigationUnbeknown to the task force in New York a separate team from the drug agency had around that time started a sting operation against money launderers working with Mexican drug cartels That fall for instance an undercover agent posing as a cartel financier had persuaded Mr Racine Mr Cournoyers New York manager and one of his closest partners to give him 94000 in marijuana profits promising to reinvest  and cleanse  the money through the purchase of cocaineThough the agents in New York could have had Mr Racine arrested at that point they chose to let him go albeit under surveillance to preserve the investigation Mr Tisciones task force knew that Mr Cournoyer already had ties to the Hells Angels the Mohawk smugglers and the Rizzuto crime family of Montreal which ran large swaths of that citys drug trade Now the task force realized that the outfit also had a Mexican component and set about to infiltrate that corner of the businessIt took a few years but by 2010 the agents had persuaded Mr Cree who was facing a lengthy prison term to work as an informant According to Mr Tiscione they had Mr Cree engineer a money drop at a safe house only blocks from the Brooklyn federal courthouse Calling Mr Cournoyer one day Mr Cree offered to oversee the shipment of 200000 from New York to Los Angeles for a 6 percent commission As part of the deal he was given the phone number of a man in California who would take the cash on arrivalWhen undercover agents in Los Angeles called that number they reached a man named Alessandro Taloni Mr Taloni court papers say was an Italianborn associate of the Rizzutos who also served as Mr Cournoyers manager for West Coast operations He ran a lucrative moneylaundering business out west using dirty cash to buy cocaine from the Sinaloa drug cartel while maintaining his sideline as a vendor of highend haircare products A former salesman at a Montreal mens shop Mr Taloni had been charged a decade earlier with threatening to kill the owner of a rival clothing store in an attempt to cow the competitionNow the agents watched Mr Taloni pick up the money that a courier hired by Mr Cree had flown to California on a private jet After fetching the delivery Mr Taloni with the surveillance team in tow continued on in his MercedesBenz to the Beverly Hills Hotel There court papers say he met another man who handed him a suitcase with a second cache of money This was cause enough for the agents on his tail to stop him and later to search his apartment where they found 49 kilograms of plasticwrapped cocaine and nearly 1 million all of it in cashAlmost from the moment their case began Mr Tiscione and the task force had relied on oldfashioned grinditout police work Now however the task force caught a lucky and unexpected breakDominick Curatola was a muralist turned house painter turned pot dealer living on Long Island He was a minor player but he still had connections his boss in Canada was a close associate of Mr CournoyerOne day in midNovember 2010 Mr Curatolas usual money launderer was unavailable and he found himself in need of someone to help him move a cash shipment to Canada According to Mr Tiscione Mr Cournoyer volunteered his own man for the job a Hondurasborn trafficker named Jos CastilloMedinaMr CastilloMedina three years earlier was involved in the cartel moneylaundering operation with Mr Racine Now he was at it again according to court papers dispatching a woman named Elizabeth Jennings to meet with Mr Curatola in the parking lot of a Staples store in Brooklyn Even the government acknowledges that this was a onetime favor Mr CastilloMedina simply picked the wrong day to be helpfulAs it happened a different team of federal drug agents on Long Island had for weeks been following Mr Curatola and were there that day when Ms Jennings took from him a black Express shopping bag filled with 169000 then hurried back to her apartment in Brooklyn to walk her dog They were also there when Mr CastilloMedina arrived at the apartment later When the agents searched the place they found bags of marijuana two narcotics scales 500000 in cash and coded ledgers indicating deals of more than 4 million between a man named Primo and a large New York distributor referred to only as Staten IslandIt took a wiretap investigation to finally determine that Primo was Mr CastilloMedina and that Staten Island was a Bonanno crime family associate named John Venizelos Besides selling millions of dollars worth of marijuana court papers say Mr Venizelos who favored hornrim glasses and Ralph Lauren pastels managed a Mafiaowned strip club Jaguars 3Once the task force had identified Mr Venizelos federal agents descended on his house on Staten Island and then on his parents house nearby They seized more marijuana more narcotics scales and more ledgers as well as a shotgun and a loaded GlockThey also seized an encrypted BlackBerry Mr Tiscione said which was the device of choice for the Cournoyer outfit Given that a number of the bosss men were already in custody the agents were especially concerned by a message that Mr Venizelos had sent just days before his own arrest to a partner who had been captured and was under pressure to cooperate with the task forceU just got to hope they never find out u said a word seriously bro Mr Venizelos wrote He added chillingly that Mr Cournoyer kept on hand a 2 million slush fund to pay for the murder of anyone who crossed himThe flight to Mexico left Canada at 6 am Among the passengers onboard that day Feb 16 2012 was Jimmy CournoyerAfter five years of flipping witnesses listening to wiretaps and conducting secret stings Mr Tiscione and his team had finally gotten a Brooklyn grand jury to indict Mr Cournoyer on drug conspiracy charges on Jan 20 2012 A month later the newly minted defendant tried to abscond to CancunLanding at the airport he was immediately detained by the Mexican authorities Pointing to a red notice alert issued in his name by Interpol they refused to let him inAlthough Mexican officials tried three times to put Mr Cournoyer on a plane to the United States he refused to go threatening court papers say to harm the captain and the crew Finally he was hooded and escorted onto a flight to HoustonIn the year that followed his arrest Mr Cournoyer and his lawyer Gerald J McMahon disputed his removal from Mexico as a forcible abduction and tried to have the sprawling case against him dismissed But as the evidence mounted Mr Cournoyer pleaded guilty in May 2013 just days before his trial was scheduled to begin in federal court in BrooklynEven though marijuana is increasingly legalized and unlike methamphetamine or heroin rarely makes for sensational headlines prosecutors argued in a sentencing memorandum that Mr Cournoyers operation was a violent one and that it led to the enrichment of other criminal syndicates His friends and family countered with letters to the Brooklyn court praising Mr Cournoyers good nature and blaming his criminal exploits on the trauma he suffered at age 16 when his father left his familyThats when I started to see a change in my son his mother Linda Bremer wrote He wasnt focused anymore He was kind of a rebel I thought it was because of the divorceWhatever his psychic pain Jimmy Cournoyer had been driven all along by a singular passion his lawyer said in an interview a love of moneyTheres a lot of weed smokers here on the Eastern Seaboard a lot of them Mr McMahon explained Thats why he came to New York for the capitalist markets It was basically a Karl Marx kind of thing,2014-09-07T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/marijuana-teens-health-risks/,When the antidrug educator Tim Ryan talks to students he often asks them what they know about marijuana Its a plant is a common responseBut more recently the answer has changed Now they reply Its legal in ColoradoThese are confusing times for middle and high school students who for most of their young lives have been lectured about the perils of substance abuse particularly marijuana Now it seems that the adults in their lives have done an aboutfaceRecreational marijuana is legal in Colorado and in Washington and many other states have approved it for medical use Lawmakers the news media and even parents are debating the merits of fullscale legalizationThey are growing up in a generation where marijuana used to be bad and maybe now its not bad said Mr Ryan a senior prevention specialist with FCD Educational Services an antidrug group that works with students in the classroomTheir parents are telling them not to do it but they may be supporting legalization of it at the same timeAntidrug advocates say efforts to legalize marijuana have created new challenges as they work to educate teenagers and their parents about the unique risks that alcohol marijuana and other drugs pose to the developing teenage brainThese educators say their goal is not to vilify marijuana or take a stand on legalization instead they say their role is to convince young people and their parents that the use of drugs is not just a moral or legal issue but a significant health issueThe health risks are real said Steve Pasierb the chief executive of the Partnership for DrugFree Kids Every passing year science unearths more health risks about why any form of substance use is unhealthy for young peopleAlready nearly half of teenagers  44 percent  have tried marijuana at least once according to data from the partnership Regular use is less common One in four teenagers report using marijuana in the past month and 7 percent report frequent use  at least 20 times in the past monthEven in the states where marijuana is legal it remains like alcohol offlimits to anyone younger than 21 But the reality is that once a product becomes legal it becomes much easier for underage users to obtain itThis summer the Partnership for DrugFree Kids released its annual tracking study in which young people were asked what stopped them from trying drugs Getting into trouble with the law and disappointing their parents were cited as the two most common reason young people did not use marijuana The concern now is that legalization will remove an important mental barrier that keeps adolescents from trying marijuana at a young ageMaking it legal makes it much more accessible more available said Dr Nora Volkow the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse This is the reality so what we need to do is to prevent the damage or at least minimize it as much as possibleDrug prevention experts say the Just Say No approach of the 1980s does not work The goal of parents should not be to prevent their kids from ever trying marijuanaInstead the focus should be on practical reasons to delay use of any mindaltering substance including alcohol until they are olderThe reason is that young brains continue to develop until the early 20s and young people who start using alcohol or marijuana in their teens are far more vulnerable to longterm substanceabuse problemsThe brain is still wiring itself during adolescence and marijuana  or any drug use  during this period essentially trains the reward system to embrace a mindaltering chemicalWe know that 90 percent of adults who are addicted began use in teenage years Mr Pasierb said They programmed the reward and drive center of their teenage brain that this is one of those things that rewards and drives me like food does like sex doesStudies in New Zealand and Canada have found that marijuana use in the teenage years can result in lost IQ points Mr Pasierb says the current generation of young people are high achievers and are interested in the scientific evidence about how substance use can affect intelligenceYou have to focus on brain maturation he said This generation of kids wants good brains they want to get into better schools Talk to a junior or senior about whether marijuana use shaves a couple points off their SATs and they will listen to youBecause early exposure to marijuana can change the trajectory of brain development even a few years of delaying use in the teen years is better Research shows that young adults who smoked pot regularly before the age of 16 performed significantly worse on cognitive function tests than those who started smoking in their later teenage yearsDrug educators say that one benefit of the legalization talk is that it may lead to more research on the health effects of marijuana on young people and more funding for antidrug campaignsThe Partnership for DrugFree Kids plans to continue its Above the Influence marketing campaign which studies show has been an effective way of reaching teenagers about the risks of drug use The campaign does not target a specific drug but it teaches

NYT,http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/28/timing-the-call-to-repeal-marijuana/,In February of 2011 The Seattle Times published a very influential editorial calling for marijuana to be legalized Its impact was significant because it gave mainstream support to legalization at the moment when the state of Washington was beginning a serious debate on the issue In November of 2012 the states residents voted by a 56to41 margin to legalize marijuana for recreational purposesIn the practice of editorial writing timing matters a great deal The series that The New York Times editorial board began on Sunday calling for an end to the federal ban on marijuana is receiving a great deal of attention not because it is a wildly radical move far ahead of its time Its because it comes at a moment when the country is engaged on this topic and is moving with surprising speed toward a different appraisal of marijuana than existed in the 1970s when the current ban went into effectSo far 37 states plus the District of Columbia have liberalized their marijuana laws in some fashion either decriminalizing possession allowing various forms of medical use or legalizing it outright Two more states  Alaska and Oregon  are preparing to vote on legalization and others are likely to do the same before long A year ago polls show public sentiment for legalization first became a majority position There are several bills in Congress to end or soften the federal ban and in May the House voted to stop prosecuting medical use of marijuana in states that allow itThese are not new arguments said the Los Angeles Times citing statistics about the cost to society of widespread marijuana arrests But this time they come from the New York Times not High Times Support for marijuana legalization has grown so rapidly within the last decade and especially within the last two years that some advocates and pollsters have compared it with the sudden collapse of opposition to samesex marriage as a cultureredefining eventSome newspapers seemed to be shocked by our editorial statement The expression of so progressive and colourful an opinion is a surprising move from a newspaper so earnest in its coverage that it is nicknamed the Grey Lady  wrote The GuardianBut a few web sites including Gawker and Gothamist said we should have taken this stand years ago The Thought Leaders are late to the party and showed up with half a sixpack and a sticky roach Gothamist wroteIf the current editorial series had been written in the Clinton years it might have caused a stir but would have had very little impact on a society that wasnt ready to hear itMore to the point The Times wasnt ready to write it back then It was important for the board  which still believes in the oldfashioned virtues of deliberation and examination  to see how the legalization experiment was working in Colorado and Washington which so far is quite well The two states did a good job of creating a regulation mechanism and Colorado which is further along has kept legal marijuana out of the hands of minors and is beginning to collect a substantial amount of tax revenue In addition the criminaljustice costs of arresting hundreds of thousands of people for marijuana possession have become overwhelming as documented in one of the best studies on the subject which was produced just last year by the American Civil Liberties UnionEven welltimed editorial positions need constant updating however Kate Riley the editorial page editor of The Seattle Times said its vital to keep reminding the federal government of the cost of its ban on states that have chosen to legalizeWe feel like weve been hollering at the administration across 3000 miles on everything from banking to irrigation water and even had to chide some sense into our own congressional delegation she said in an email Yet so far the US Bureau of Reclamation does not want water from its federal dams in Eastern Washington to be used on cannabisWere glad to have joined The Seattle Times and other newspapers that have come out in favor of legalization or decriminalization The hollering is only beginning,2014-07-28T16:05:34Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/realestate/this-weeks-questions-focus-on-air-quality-inside-new-york-city-homes.html,Ask Real Estate is a weekly column that answers questions from across the New York region Submit yours to realestateqanytimescomWhen Smoke Gets in Your ApartmentQMy two roommates and I live on the top floor of a 12story rental building For several months there has been an enormous amount of black exhaust emanating from our roof This disgusting diesellike smoke gets blown through our windows and cakes our floors and furniture with a black oily film Not only has this ruined my furniture but I am concerned about the air I am breathing Are there any environmental precedents that can compel our landlord to get rid of this nasty smoke We have called and complained multiple times with no responseWashington Heights ManhattanA New Yorkers endure many inconveniences as tenants but black smoke caking your floors and furniture should not be among them The oily film that has damaged your furniture could be harming your bodies tooScientific studies have linked exposure to particulate matter to reduced lung function asthma bronchitis heart disease and even cancer according to Lauren Zajac a fellow at the Department of Preventive Medicine at Mount Sinai HospitalStart complaining louder Call 311 and report the condition to the citys Department of Buildings which enforces the citys construction codes and the Department of Environmental Protection which enforces the city air pollution control code These agencies can send out inspectors and issue violations against your landlord Also reach out to your local City Council member who could advocate on your behalfYou also have legal remedies as hazardous fumes in your apartment could certainly breach the warranty of habitability and could also constitute a private nuisance You could withhold your rent which would get your landlords attention But if the landlord takes you to housing court you risk turning up on the infamous tenant blacklist making it difficult for you to find another apartment elsewhere Withholding rent is a basic right that exists under law that has become unenforceable because of the blacklist said Stephen Dobkin a lawyer who represents tenantsInstead file what is known as an HP proceeding in housing court The court could direct the landlord to correct the violations and has the power to enforce its orders Thats one remedy that we frequently pursue Mr Dobkin saidPotSmoking NeighborsQ I understand that secondhand smoke from cigarettes is increasingly banned in public places But do the same rules apply to marijuana and to the secondhand smoke that moves from one apartment to another Our landlord generally declines to follow up on complaints about pot but are there ways to get the management to move under more general secondhand smoke regulationsRoosevelt Island ManhattanA No one is allowed to smoke in the common areas of a residential building with 10 or more units but the law does not prohibit people from smoking in the privacy of their own homes although some individual buildings do When it comes to the secondhand smoke drifting into a neighboring apartment the courts have frequently sided with the aggrieved neighbor since cigarette smoke is a known carcinogenBut marijuana is a little different It is illegal to possess although it has been decriminalized to some degree And medical marijuana is not permitted in a smokable form Most of the court cases about secondhand smoke in apartments however deal with cigarette smoke not potSecondhand cigarette smoke is different from secondhand marijuana smoke said Janet Ray Kalson a lawyer who represents tenants Secondhand cigarette smoke is an established health hazard and marijuana smoke is notAssuming you dont want to call the police knock on your neighbors door and explain politely that the odor of his smoke drifts into your apartment and causes you discomfort Ask the neighbor to crack a window or use an air filter when he smokes as that might lessen the effects Perhaps the neighbor could reserve one room in the apartment for smoking  preferably one that does not share a wall with your apartmentIf your neighbor ignores you keep a journal about when the marijuana smoking happens including the date time duration and the effect it has on your health With that information approach the managingagentand request help express concerns about the habitability of your apartment and the nuisance the smoke creates If that does not work you could start what is known as an HP proceeding against the landlord in housing court and see if the courts would step in and help clear the airIs the Outside Air Safe to BreatheQ I live with my wife and our two young children in a thirdfloor apartment next to a busy avenue Should we open the windows to get fresh air Or should we keep the windows closed and run air purifiers The supporters of fresh air bring up indoor air pollution like gas leaks household cleaners dust and allergens But is the air outside any better Id say no judging by the layer of soot on our windows Plus there are multiple studies and position statements fromleading health organizations linking outdoor air pollution to increased health risks What are your thoughts on the subjectUpper East Side ManhattanA You might be surprised to learn that the air on the Upper East Side has more fine particulate matter than many other New York City neighborhoods  including Mott Haven in the South Bronx But before you pull out a gas mask consider the big picture You live in a neighborhood where childhood asthma rates are well below the city averageIf you are concerned about household toxins swap the commercial products for a solution made from common household products like vinegar baking soda and lemon Dust frequently and unless you live opposite the FDR Drive open your windows on a glorious autumn morning and let the air come inFresh air is a great mixture of things said William Bryant Logan an arborist and author of Air The Restless Shaper of the World W W Norton 2012 Mr Logan found plant debris minerals like silica fungal spores and soil in the air he sampled There are very beautiful things like the scales off butterfly and moth wings he saidWhen he sampled the air alongside the Bruckner Expressway in the South Bronx however his findings were far less colorful It was entirely carbon he said If I lived there I would moveExposure to high volumes of truck traffic can have serious health consequences particularly for children or anyone suffering from asthma When youre talking about people in the Bronx who live close to truck traffic we recommend that they keep their windows closed and keep their AC on said Judith T Zelikoff a

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/us/politics/higher-minimum-wages-prove-popular-in-fla-marijuana-is-less-so.html,onalVoters in four states on Tuesday supported measures to raise their minimum wages bringing the number of states that have passed such laws to 29 and reflecting widespread dissatisfaction with Congresss failure to increase the federal minimum of 725Residents of Washington DC and Oregon voted to allow recreational use of marijuana following the lead of Colorado and Washington State But in Florida a hotly contested measure to expand the use of marijuana for medical treatment now permitted in 23 states failed narrowly Though a majority of voters approved the measure the margin fell short of the 60 percent it needed to passSupport for lowwage workers and marijuana legalization were just two issues among the many that voters considered in 146 state ballot measures in 41 states covering such topics as genetically modified food the right to bear arms and the right to bait bearsIn Massachusetts voters upheld by a wide margin a 2011 law to allow casino gambling after heavy spending by gambling interests and in another lift for workers rights they required employers to give employees paid sick leaveThough it may seem as if voters had an overwhelming number of issues to decide the numbers of ballot measures are actually trending down according to the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California The number of citizenled initiatives and referendums was at its lowest in an evennumbered year since 1974 in part because some states have made it more difficult to put measures on the ballotJust as notable perhaps is what was not subject to the popular vote Amendments defining marriage as a heterosexual institution were missing as were measures requiring voter identification  though several initiatives dealt with early voting and voter registration States for the most part avoided the hotly disputed topic of immigration except in Oregon where voters rejected a measure that would have allowed illegal immigrants to get drivers licensesSome ballot measures are used as a political tool to raise voter interest Republican critics said some of the measures to increase the minimum wage had been placed on the ballot to bolster turnout for vulnerable Democrats but support for raising the minimum wage has historically crossed party linesI cant stress how popular of an issue it is among voters regardless of political affiliation said Tsedeye Gebreselassie a senior staff lawyer for the National Employment Law Project And the federal minimum wage has been stuck at 725 since 2009Four states  Alaska Arkansas Nebraska and South Dakota  passed measures to increase the minimum wage Alaskas measure will increase the minimum wage to 975 in 2016 the Arkansas measure raises the minimum wage to 850 by 2017 Nebraskas will rise to 9 by 2016 and South Dakotas goes to 850 By a wide margin Illinois voters also recommended an increase to the minimum wage but the vote was nonbindingBoth advocates and opponents of marijuana legalization had expected voters to approve the Oregon and Washington DC measuresThe Washington initiative makes it legal for adults to possess and grow limited amounts of marijuana for personal use while Oregons allows adults age 21 and over to have up to eight ounces of marijuana in their home and up to four plants The manufacture and sale of marijuana products would be licensed and regulated by the State Liquor Control Commission Congress may attempt to block Washingtons vote on marijuana and Representative Andy Harris a Republican from Maryland has already promised to do soBut Mason Tvert a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project which supports legalization said The movement toward ending marijuana prohibition will not go backward its simply a question of how quickly it moves forwardVoters in Alaska also moved to legalized marijuanaIn Florida where the marijuana issue figured in the governors race the story was different There John Morgan a prominent trial lawyer and a supporter of the Democratic challenger Charlie Crist spent 38 million supporting the medical marijuana measure according to Ballotpedia an online politics encyclopedia that tracks ballot initiatives Sheldon Adelson a casino magnate spent even more 55 million opposing it according to committee filingsMr Crist favored the measure and even said it might bring more younger voters to the polls potentially bolstering his support while the Republican incumbent Rick Scott and former Gov Jeb Bush also a Republican opposed it Support for the measure started strong but slipped in recent polls and Mr Crist lost to Mr ScottThe vast majority of America has not legalized marijuana so I dont think its a foregone conclusion that the nation will follow Colorado and Washington State both of which legalized recreational use of marijuana in 2012 said Kevin Sabet the head of Smart Approaches to Marijuana which opposes legalizing the recreational use of the drug As the negative effects show up it could start to turn people offAnother perennial issue gambling has become more urgent as states wrestle with casino closings and bankruptcies In Massachusetts a 2011 law allowed for three casinos and one slotmachine parlor none of which have been built The initiative to repeal the law attracted deeppocketed opposition from the gambling industry which vastly outspent anticasino groups and argued that gambling would create jobs and that the slot parlor which was under construction had already done soNo state has repealed a law expanding gambling since the era of the modern casino began in 1931 according to Clyde W Barrow a political scientist at the University of TexasPan AmericanCalifornia had perhaps the most expensive ballot measure fight in the country pitting trial lawyers against doctors over a measure that would have required doctors to take drug and alcohol tests and would also have raised the cap on pain and suffering awards in medical malpractice casesThe measure failed as doctors and insurance companies spent heavily to defeat it together the two deeppocketed sides raised more than 70 millionCalifornias governor Jerry Brown who won reelection Tuesday also spent more on television ads supporting two ballot measures than he did on his own campaign Both measures passed easily One authorizes 71 billion in water infrastructure projects during a historic drought and the other requires the state to save more in its rainyday fund and to pay down more debtCalifornia voters also approved a ballot measure intended to address prison overcrowding by reducing many nonviolent felonies to misdemeanorsSome hotbutton issues like abortion and gun control were scarce on this years ballots but in Colorado the group Personhood USA backed an amendment to defined an unborn human as a person in Colorados criminal code and wrongfuldeath act The group has twice failed to win passage of a broader amendment that would have granted personhood to an unborn human being in all areas of law and its more limited measure was again rejected by voters on TuesdayIn North Dakota voters rejected a similar amendment that said life begins at conception But in Tennessee voters approved an amendment allowing the legislature to regulate abortion a power that was denied by a State Supreme Court decision in 2000Also in Washington voters approved a measure that would expand background checks on all gun sales as well as transfers including private transactions A second rival measure that would have prevented the state from expanding checks beyond what federal requirements was trailing,2014-11-05T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/a-nation-in-transition-investigating-evolving-research-and-policy-on-marijuana/,Marijuana is illegal in the United States Yet 35 states and the District of Columbia permit some form of marijuana consumption for medical purposes and as of this year two states now allow its recreational use As national policy evolves on this issue the New York Times editorial board this summer published a  sixpart series calling for legalization In this lesson we pull together those opinion pieces as well as many other Times articles graphics and videos to offer starting points for science social studies and English teachers aiming to use the debate as an opportunity for learning research and discussion  Are you teaching this topic How What have we missedThe Natural History of MarijuanaLike other crops marijuana is largely cultivated  legally and illegally  in greenhousetype grow houses and on farms And like other crops marijuana comes from a plant  cannabis originally found in the wild and cultivated over thousands of years Have students research the history of cannabis from its origins in South and Central Asia to its introduction to the Americas  How have people used the different parts of the plant throughout history Then have students work in groups to annotate a map of the world tracing the history of marijuana cultivation This Is Your Brain  and Body  on DrugsMarijuana is best known for its psychoactive properties But how does marijuana bring about these sensations and how else does it behave in the body To answer these questions students might research how the active compounds in marijuana affect the body at the level of the cell and draw parallels with how other drugs act in the body  As is the case with many other drugs  from legal overthecounter medications to illegal street drugs like heroin  the active compounds interact with locations on the surfaces of cells called receptors Cell surface receptors provide a means for cells to receive information and input from the environment when a molecule attaches or binds to a cell surface receptor it triggers a series of events inside the cell like the release of hormones neurotransmitters or other molecules A discussion about marijuanas effects on the body might dovetail nicely with a broader class discussion or review of cell biology the makeup and function of the cell membrane and the function of neurotransmitters To dive a little deeper explain that cells in the human body have receptors for the active compounds in marijuana collectively referred to as cannabinoids By binding to cannabinoid receptors cannabinoid molecules affect how cells release chemical messengers called neurotransmitters The human body naturally makes cannabinoids and the main active ingredients in marijuana mimic these molecules and can therefore bind to the same receptors This might help to explain some of the effects marijuana is reported to have not just on the brain but on other body systems as well With this background in place have students research some of the conditions and disorders marijuana is reported to help What evidence do scientists use to support the idea that marijuana may help these and other conditions What kind of additional evidence about the beneficial effects of marijuana do scientists need and how do they suggest better using marijuana in ways that best help patients Medical Marijuana and ChildrenReview the two active compounds in marijuana THC and cannabidiol CBD and talk about how selective breeding techniques can produce strains of marijuana with varying amounts of these compounds Why might it be important for marijuana used in a therapeutic setting to have a low level of THC  Then watch both of these brief videos Healing Hemp and Pediatric Pot Which of the two active compounds has shown promise in treating children with seizures What are some of the barriers to making this compound more widely accessible What do scientists still need to learn about how this compound works Why arent there more studies of promising applications for medical marijuana Use these videos as a springboard for a discussion about using medical marijuana in young people What do its proponents have to say What are some of the main arguments against it  The Risks of Marijuana UseWhat does medical science have to say about the risks associated with marijuana use compared with the legal but regulated substances tobacco and alcohol The illegal substances cocaine and heroin Students might compare these risks using a chart or other simple graphic organizer What are gateway drugs and why might it be time to revisit the claim that marijuana use predicts harder drug use  What does medical science also have to say about the potential health benefits of marijuanaAt the same time what new information about the developing teenage brain suggests that recreational marijuana use in places where it has been legalized should be prohibited for minors Students might read further about marijuana and the teenage brain like these studies suggesting actual structural changes in the brains of young people who regularly use marijuanaAs students read and work you might have them annotate diagrams of the human body and brain highlighting the various systems affected by marijuana and the effect marijuana has on these systems The History of Marijuana ProhibitionIf marijuana is now considered to have valid medicinal purposes by the scientific community and if marijuana is less dangerous than the highly addictive but perfectly legal substances known as alcohol and tobacco how did the federal government come to categorize it as a Schedule I drug  in the same class of drugs as the highly addictive heroin and more harmful than the Schedule II drug cocaine Students can research the evolving history of attitudes and policy toward marijuana in the United States As a starting point they can read about the role that prejudice and stereotypes and a general fear of Mexican immigrants and AfricanAmericans played in formulating federal policy toward marijuana They can also consult this timeline of marijuana use in the United States and this article on the origins of the term marijuana Evaluating the War on DrugsMarijuana policy has affected millions of lives From 2001 to 2010 the police made 82 million marijuana arrests In 2011 there were more arrests for marijuana possession than for all violent crimes put together And those arrests disproportionately affect AfricanAmericans even though blacks and whites use marijuana at similar rates In states like Iowa Minnesota and Illinois blacks are more than seven times as likely to get arrested as whites for marijuana offenses Nationally blacks are 37 times as likely Arrests often lead to jail time and they can affect employment education and even the ability to get a bank loan Beyond the racial imbalance some nonviolent offenders are spending decades in jail for marijuana possession while in other states marijuana entrepreneurs are getting rich Students can study the consequences of the war on marijuana Who is most affected How are they affected How much does the war cost And what are the results They can start with Jesse Wegmans editorial on the injustice of marijuana arrests and look at this American Civil Liberties Union multimedia presentationDebating Public PolicyCurrent federal law states that marijuana like all other Schedule I drugs has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States Yet 35 states and the District of Columbia permit some form of marijuana consumption for medical purposes And two Colorado and Washington now allow recreational use of marijuana with more states considering a similar move With such radical inconsistency between federal and state law the country is ripe for a national rethinking of its marijuana policy Students can hold a mock Congress or simulate a state legislative session to debate whether marijuana should be removed from the Controlled Substances Act or whether their state should legalize marijuana for medical or recreational use or both Should states treat marijuana like alcohol  regulating and taxing it while banning its use by minors To do their research they can read David Firestones argument in favor of letting the states decide just as states did regarding alcoholic beverages after the end of Prohibition in 1933 Then students can seek out additional evidence on both sides of the debate and determine their own states policy toward marijuana  After their discussion they can write a policy paper advocating a position or simply answer our Student Opinion question Should Marijuana Be LegalIf students want to delve deeper they can investigate Colorados legalization experiment along with some of the early bumps on the road and the finer details of marijuana regulation  This resource may be used to address the academic standards

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/opinion/from-marijuana-to-gun-control-liberal-initiatives-passed.html,The Democratic brand did not fare well to put it mildly in congressional and governors races on Tuesday Most were contests of political blame driven by ideological hatred for President Obama But when the ballot offered a choice on an actual policy rather than between candidates with a D or R next to their names voters made notably liberal decisions in both red and blue statesOn at least six highprofile and often contentious issues  minimum wage marijuana legalization criminal justice reform abortion rights gun control and environmental protection  voters approved ballot measures in some cases overwhelmingly that were directly at odds with the positions of many of the Republican winnersMINIMUM WAGE Initiatives to raise the minimum wage appeared on the ballots in four deepred states  Alaska Arkansas Nebraska and South Dakota  and passed in all of them The new hourly minimums range from 850 in Arkansas by 2017 to 975 in Alaska by 2016 Minimumwage increases were also approved in San Francisco to 15 an hour by 2018 and Oakland to 1225 an hour by 2015 In all an estimated 609000 lowwage workers will see raises from these approved increasesIn addition voters in Illinois and in several cities and counties in Wisconsin approved nonbinding measures calling for minimums of 10 or more If legislators follow through on the voters will 11 million workers in those states would see raisesThe latest increases bring to 29 the number of states that exceed or soon will exceed the paltry federal minimum of 725 an hour which has been in place since 2009 They underscore the broad support for higher minimums and suggest that Republicans who continue to oppose a higher federal minimum could pay a price in the 2016 elections when lowerwage workers and those who support them could turn out in higher numbersMARIJUANA  Oregon and Alaska became the third and fourth states to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes Colorado and Washington were the first two while the District of Columbia repealed all criminal and civil penalties for possession and allowed limited private cultivation of the drugEven where prolegalization measures lost advocates had reason to feel positive A proposed constitutional amendment in Florida to legalize medical marijuana received 57 percent of the vote but it still failed because amendments there require at least 60 percent approvalBefore Tuesdays election it was already clear that Americans had turned against prohibition because more than 30 states had liberalized their marijuana laws Maybe elected officials who have lagged behind the public on this issue will finally have the courage to embrace changeCRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM For the second time in three years Californians voted to shorten the sentences of people serving time in prison The state  which created the notorious threestrikes law  remains under federal court order to reduce prison overcrowdingIn 2012 voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 36 which has led to the early release of more than 1900 threestrikers serving life in prison And there has not been an increase in crime Proposition 47 on this weeks ballot converts lowlevel drug and property offenses  like shoplifting writing bad checks or simple drug possession  from felonies to misdemeanors It is expected to reduce the sentences of as many as 10000 inmatesOn Tuesday the measure which enjoyed broad bipartisan support passed with more than 58 percent of the vote Many politicians are still afraid of looking soft on crime but Californias experience shows that voters can lead the wayABORTION RIGHTS The overwhelming rejection of personhood measures in Colorado and North Dakota dealt another welldeserved blow to the effort by some opponents of reproductive rights to ban all abortions and some common forms of contraception by passing laws giving fertilized eggs legal rights and protections that apply to individualsThe defeat in Colorado was not unexpected Voters there handily quashed earlier personhood initiatives in 2008 and 2010 and they were not deceived by this rounds revised wording But few expected a similar proposal to be rejected by 64 percent of voters in North Dakota a conservative state that  like Mississippi which roundly defeated a personhood initiative three years ago  has just one abortion provider remainingUnfortunately opponents of abortion rights scored a victory in Tennessee where nearly 53 percent of voters approved a state constitutional amendment that gives the Republicanled State Legislature leeway to curtail access to safe and legal abortion care While nothing will change immediately there will likely be a rush to enact new abortion restrictions beyond those already in place in the months ahead But politicians in Tennessee would be wrong to read Tuesdays relatively close vote as a mandate to obliterate a womans fundamental rightGUN CONTROL In the aftermath of the school massacre in 2012 in Newtown Conn Congress  caving to the National Rifle Association  did nothing to protect the public from gun violence In Washington State a campaign started by outraged church and community leaders fared much better Initiative 594 which will require criminal and mentalhealth checks on gun buyers drew an impressive 60 percent voter support on TuesdayJust as important the gun lobbys measure  Initiative 591 which was on the same ballot  would have blocked background checks and was defeated by 55 percent of the vote Other campaigns are underway at the statehouse level supported by former New York City mayor Michael Bloombergs wellfinanced gunsafety movement and others Opponents decried Mr Bloombergs campaign as outside interference but got nowhere this timeCONSERVATION Environmentalists who may be singing the blues over the election results can take heart from approval of a record 13 billion in land conservation measures in states and cities across the country Two were especially significantIn Florida a constitutional amendment will dedicate 9 billion in real estate transfer taxes over the next 20 years to preserving open spaces including major investments in the threatened EvergladesNew Jersey voters dedicated 215 billion in corporate tax revenue to land conservation also over the next 20

whether to legalize marijuana pushing closer to the mainstream a notion that was once consigned to the political fringeBallot initiatives in Oregon and Alaska would set up a network of regulated pot stores similar to those already operating in Colorado and Washington state A measure in the District of Columbia would allow possession but not retail salesIf successful the ballot initiatives could build momentum for legalization in other states and force candidates in the 2016 presidential election to take a stand on the issuePublic opinion on marijuana has shifted sharply in the past several years and polls indicate more Americans now support legalization than oppose it Advocates say that like gay marriage legal pot is an idea that gains support once people see it in actionThe more public dialogue that goes on about this issue the more support there is said Mason Tvert of the Marijuana Policy Project which is supporting the legalization drive in AlaskaOpponents say legalization will create an aggressive new industry that like the tobacco business will profit by marketing an addictive product to teens Unlike gay marriage legal pot will have harmful effects many sayI dont know anybody who looks around and says My life is better when everybody around me is stoned said Kevin Sabet a former White House drugpolicy adviser who now heads up Smart Approaches to Marijuana an antilegalization groupFew elected officials in the country support legalization  and observers do not expect that to change any time soonIt seems that this is an area where the public is out in front of their elected officials said Jake Weigler an Oregon Democratic strategist not affiliated with the legalization effortSo for the moment advocates are focused on ballot initiatives Such referendums allow voters to shape policy directly at the state level this year alone ballots in various states include measures to raise the minimum wage restrict abortion and ban certain types of bear huntingOn the marijuana issue voters in the District of Columbia back legalization by a twotoone margin according to recent polling while a narrow majority supports legal pot in Oregon Opinion polls in Alaska have been inconsistentNationwide roughly one in four Americans say they have used pot according to ReutersIpsos polling Some 47 percent support legalization and 35 percent oppose itMarijuana remains illegal under federal law but President Barack Obama has allowed Colorado and Washington to move forward with legalization Federal prosecutors have been told to focus enforcement on areas such as interstate trafficking and selling to minors rather than possession The next president will have to decide whether to continue that approach or to insist that federal law trumps local concernsCHANGES OVER TWO DECADESMarijuana has been edging toward legal status across the country since California became the first state to allow its use for medical purposes in 1996The medical use of marijuana to ease ailments ranging from glaucoma to chronic pain is now legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia Florida may become the first state in the South to approve medical pot in NovemberSome 18 states have also removed criminal penalties for possession of small amounts as policymakers on the left and the right have questioned the social and fiscal costs of imprisoning nonviolent drug users Nationwide about 650000 people were arrested for marijuana possession in 2012 FBI statistics showColorado and Washington opened the first statelicensed pot stores earlier this year following legalization referendums in 2012Beau Kilmer a drug policy expert at the RAND Corporation a nonpartisan think tank said it is too soon to determine how those efforts are faring because there is not enough data to determine whether legalization has led to more crime higher rates of underage use or more people driving while highColorado residents are split on legalizations merits Some 51 percent of likely voters in the state support it and 41 percent oppose it according to ReutersIpsos pollingOpponents of legal marijuana are not like the antidrug warriors of past decades Many support decriminalization and medical use if done carefully but argue that other states should not be in such a hurry to follow Colorado and Washington all the way to legal pot shopsI dont want to speak for the next couple of years but right now its not the right choice said Charles Fedullo a spokesman for Big Marijuana Big Mistake which opposes the legalization drive in AlaskaAdvocates have plenty of money to spend In liberalleaning Oregon backers are spending 2 million on a primetime TV ad campaign Opponents meanwhile have raised a mere 168000 largely from lawenforcement groups In Alaska a

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/opinion/the-marijuana-series-other-views.html, To the EditorRegarding your editorial series advocating legalization of marijuanaWhen I ask students in my course on drugs and society if they advocate reforming federal marijuana laws their support is unanimous Yet they are equally unanimous in saying they dont want their own children to use marijuana My students conflicted reactions offer a microcosm of the tension at the heart of marijuana reform How can we move beyond unbridled prohibition in ways that will tolerate but not celebrate moderate use of marijuana by adultsIronically it is the same marginalized communities that feel the brunt of the drug war that are now at greatest risk of becoming fodder for businesses and governments eager to cash in on marijuana Recent figures from Colorado show early troubling evidence of the Pareto or 8020 principle in legal marijuana markets as with alcohol tobacco and lotteries most of the revenue is coming from a small percentage of heavy usersJust as some people keep a few chickens without government regulation let them grow a few marijuana plants But the last thing we need is a profiteering marijuana industry and another regressive sin tax that will merely trade one set of injustices for anotherJONATHAN M WENDER Seattle July 31 2014 The writer a former police officer is a professor at the University of WashingtonTo the EditorYour recent series about marijuana legalization precisely explains what motivated me as a member of the Council of the District of Columbia to introduce legislation in 2013 that would tax and regulate marijuana in the DistrictThe war on drugs has ravished entire communities in the District as evident from the racial disparities in marijuana arrests here According to a report released by the American Civil Liberties Union 91 percent of all drug arrests in DC were of AfricanAmericans despite selfreporting that shows equal rates of marijuana use among AfricanAmericans and whitesRecent surveys show that public support for the legalization of marijuana has changed significantly The conversation has shifted from immorality and war on drugs to one of social justice In spite of attempted congressional interference the DC Council has already taken the first step toward legalization and passed a decriminalization lawThe time is ripe to move forward with a full taxandregulate approach in DC  one that prohibits selling to minors and uses the tax revenue to offer programs that help with substance abuse preventionDAVID GROSSO Washington Aug 1 2014To the EditorRe What Science Says About Marijuana editorial July 31The measuring of marijuanas addictive potential and consequences against our two most highly profitable deadly and legal drugs  tobacco and alcohol  as a justification for its legalization seems to me to reflect a terrible cynicism about public health and it distracts attention from the research findingsIs it really acceptable for one out of every 10 marijuana users among adolescents nearly one of every five to have a diagnosable disorder The majority twothirds of adolescent substance abuse treatment admissions involve marijuana as the primary disorderOther scientific facts need emphasis separate from their comparison to alcohol and tobacco Regular marijuana use is associated with cognitive educational and respiratory problems It increases risk for other substance and psychiatric diagnoses Scientific disagreement remains about marijuana as a gateway drug it is not a myth that has been disprovedMarijuana addiction and withdrawal are considered physical because this potent drug causes significant changes in the brain Finally the belief that marijuana addiction and health problems will be managed better by legalization and government regulation has no basis in science or historyDecisions about the safety of our countrys youth should not be made exclusively in the court of public political and media opinion I hope the science of marijuana addiction will not be minimized or distorted in this polarizing debateSAMUEL A BALL New York July 31 2014 The writer is president and chief executive of CASAColumbia which does research on addiction and a professor of psychiatry at Yale Medical SchoolTo the EditorIt is both ironic and disturbing that Americans should support random drug testing even while they have begun to accept the legal use of marijuana California Asks Should Doctors Face Drug Tests front page Aug 2 Random drug tests do not detect actual impairment or job fitness but rather past use Ironically they are highly sensitive to and intolerant of offthejob marijuana use but are completely insensitive to alcohol the most abused drug of allNeither the safety nor efficacy of

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/us/bid-to-expand-medical-marijuana-business-faces-federal-hurdles.html,WRAY Colo   Behind a tall curtain of corn that hides their real cash crop from prying eyes the Stanley family is undertaking an audacious effort to expand their medical marijuana business to a national marketFor years the five Stanley brothers who sell a nonintoxicating strain of cannabis that has gained national attention as a treatment for epilepsy have grown medical marijuana in greenhouses under tight state and federal regulations But this year they are not only growing marijuana outdoors by the acre they also plan to ship an oil extracted from their plants to other statesThe plan would seem to defy a federal prohibition on the sale of marijuana products across state lines But the Stanleys have justified it with a simple semantic swap They now call their crop industrial hemp based on its low levels of THC the psychoactive ingredient in potThe jump to industrial hemp means we can serve thousands of people instead of hundreds said Jared Stanley 27 who wore muddy Carhartts and a rainbow friendship bracelet as he knelt down to prune his plantsColorado which has legalized the sale of marijuana for recreational and medical use has accepted the new designation But the real question is whether the federal government will go along If it does the impact would be significant opening the door to interstate sales not just by the Stanleys but possibly by scores of other medical cannabis growers across the countryBut if it does not the Stanley brothers could be shut down by federal agentsSo far the Drug Enforcement Administration is offering few clues insisting in public statements that while it is willing to allow marijuana sales in states that have legalized the drug it might step in if growers try to sell beyond state bordersAny chemical that comes from the plant is still a controlled substance said Dawn Dearden an agency spokeswoman When we get into hemp it gets a little squishy but it still is illegalThe Stanleys quest to ship their oil to other states highlights the fraught marijuana legal landscape where state and federal laws conflict and federal agencies can have divergent policies leaving laws sometimes enforced and sometimes notThis is the mode we will be in for some time said Sam Kamin a law professor at the University of Denver who studies cannabis law As marijuana becomes more legal in more states for more purposes the tension with the federal law will become more pronouncedThe hazy legality of hemp can be seen in products like hemp granola and shampoo which are allowed to fill health food store shelves even though they technically violate federal drug laws All those products are made from imported hemp which has generally been permitted into the country so long as it has less than 03 percent THCIf the Stanleys ship their oil industry watchers say it will be the first time in decades anyone has tried to sell domestic hemp nationwideIn recent years hundreds of families with epileptic children have moved to Colorado to try oil made from the Stanleys shrubby strain which they call Charlottes Web The national Epilepsy Foundation has called for it to be available to all patients though formal research into its effectiveness remains scant There is a nationwide waiting list of more than 9000 which the brothers hope to eliminate by expanding their crop from small greenhouses into vast hemp fieldsWe are hoping the enforcement agencies have bigger fish to fry and dont want to take a bunch of medicine away from sick kids Mr Stanley said But if they are going to do it were all in If you are going to be locked up its a thing worth getting locked up forThe brothers who had a Christian upbringing in conservative Colorado Springs started a small medical marijuana business in 2008 after seeing the relief it brought to a relative sick with cancer At first they grew mostly marijuana high in THC that packed a serious psychoactive punch On the side they experimented with breeding plants low in THC but high in another cannabinoid known as cannabidiol or CBD which scientific studies suggested was a powerful antiinflammatory that a handful of small studies showed might have potential as a treatment for certain neurological conditions including seizures and Huntingtons diseaseFor years this variety languished unused in a corner of their greenhouse No one wanted it because it couldnt get you high said Joel Stanley 34 the oldest brother and head of the family business They named the plant Hippies DisappointmentThen in 2012 a Colorado mother named Paige Figi came seeking CBDrich marijuana oil for her 5yearold daughter Charlotte who has a genetic disorder called Dravet syndrome which caused hundreds of seizures per weekAfter a few doses of oil made from Hippies Disappointment Charlottes seizures all but stopped and two years later daily drops of oil keep her nearly free of seizures Ms Figi says The Stanleys renamed the plant Charlottes WebCharlottes story spread and patients began moving to Colorado About 200 families now use the oil and many have seen significant reductions in seizures according to Dr Margaret Gedde a Colorado physician who recently conducted a small survey of the patients Though few have seen their seizures totally disappear nearly 80 percent told Dr Gedde that the oil was more effective than traditional pharmaceuticals with fewer side effectsPeople from around the world started contacting the brothers We didnt have enough Charlottes Web Jared Stanley said Under medical marijuana laws we could never have enough And there were a lot of people who couldnt just drop their lives to come to Colorado to get itColorado medical marijuana law restricted production by requiring limited plant counts locked greenhouses with security cameras and costly seed to sale tracking for every plant The law also required every milligram of Charlottes Web to remain in Colorado But last year Colorado voters passed a law legalizing industrial hemp  defined as cannabis with less than 03 percent THC  allowing farmers to grow it with few restrictions Charlottes Web falls well below that level the Stanleys say Recreational marijuana typically has THC levels around 15 percentBecause United States Customs and Border Protection has also used the 03 percent THC level for determining whether to allow imported hemp into the country the Stanleys say they can legally ship their oil But the DEA maintains that the Controlled Substances Act holds that all cannabis whether called marijuana or hemp is illegalPeople in the hemp industry say it is hard to foresee the agencys response The Bush administration cracked down on all hemp in 2003 saying whether soap cereal vegetable burgers or hemp cheese any product with a trace of THC could be seized A federal appeals court blocked the action in 2004 before it took effectThe Obama administration has generally deferred to states on the question of cannabis allowing recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington and medical use in 21 additional states and in the District of Columbia provided sales followed certain criteria But in the last four months the DEA has seized thousands of pounds of nonintoxicating industrial hemp seeds including a shipment bound for a research project at the University of KentuckyThough the Stanleys maintain that shipping hemp oil is legal they have hedged their bet by working with Representative Scott Perry Republican of Pennsylvania to introduce a bill in late July that would exempt Charlottes Web and other therapeutic hemp from the federal definition of marijuana under the Controlled Substances ActAmid the uncertainty the brothers are pressing forward They have moved oil production from a commercial kitchen to a sterile lab staffed by scientists from the pharmaceutical industry Having planted 17 acres of hemp in Colorado this year they plan to plant 200 next yearThey plan to start shipping their oil as soon as they fill their waiting list of orders in Colorado which they expect to do this fall They are also setting up a 1000acre hemp farm in Uruguay which recently legalized both marijuana and hemp to handle global sales In five years they hope to have 3000 acres growing in different states and countriesMany of their workers are parents or siblings of children who rely on the oil Penn Mattison who moved to Colorado from Tennessee last winter to treat the seizures of his 2yearold daughter Millie is oneMr Mattison said that after starting to use the oil in March his daughters seizures dropped by 90 percent Other children should have the same opportunity without having to move to Colorado he said Its something they are desperate for and we know what being desperate is all about he said as he trimmed the leaves of some Charlottes Web We were there,2014-08-24T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/15/us/ap-us-marriage-and-marijuana.html,NEW YORK   While many liberal policy goals have proved elusive during Barack Obamas presidency there have been dramatic advances for two causes that once seemed quixotic  the legalization of samesex marriage and the decriminalization of marijuanaNeither cause was embraced by Obama during his first term Yet he is now a fervent supporter of marriage equality and has said it is important that Colorado and Washington state be allowed to proceed with their pioneering laws approved by voters in 2012 that legalize marijuanaFor both issues the pace of change has been strikingThere are now 19 states that allow gay marriage compared to two in 2008 Bans in the remaining states are being struck down by federal judges at a rapid rate that could presage a Supreme Court ruling legalizing it nationwideAs for marijuana in November voters in Oregon Alaska and the District of Columbia will weigh in on ballot measures that would emulate Colorado and Washington by legalizing recreational use of pot by adults A ballot measure in Florida could add that state to the 23 others which have legalized medical use of marijuana including 10 in the past four yearsWhats distinctive about the marriage and marijuana campaigns is that theyve been able to proceed at the state level unencumbered by the paralyzing gridlock in Congress In contrast efforts by Obama and his Democratic allies to overhaul the immigration system tighten gun control laws raise the federal minimum wage and combat climate change have run aground in the partisan divides on Capitol HillThe paramount Obama initiative that did clear Congress  his health care overhaul  remains entangled in various controversies and its longterm legacy is uncertain On immigration and many of the other issues hes resorting to unilateral executive action often angering his critics on the right while failing to fully satisfy activists on the leftGiven those realities Richard Socarides a former Clinton White House adviser on gay rights makes a case that samesex marriage and other gayrights advances represent a singular achievement for progressives during the Obama presidencyBarack Obama has accomplished more progressive social change on gay rights than anything else Socarides saidDuring his first term Obama helped change military policy so gays could serve openly but said his views on samesex marriage were still evolving Under constant pressure from gayrights activists he endorsed it in 2012 and since then his administration has moved aggressively to maximize federal recognition of married gay couples even in states that ban samesex marriageThe reason why he has that record now is because publicly and privately we really held his feet to the fire said Socarides referring to the activists pressureObamas stance on marijuana is far more nuanced Marijuana remains illegal under federal law and the White Houserun Office of National Drug Control Policy opposes its legalization whether for medicinal or recreational useYet in August 2013 addressing the developments in Colorado and Washington the Justice Department said it would allow legalization efforts to proceed as long as states followed strict guidelines including keeping pot away from minors Obama an acknowledged pot smoker in his younger days subsequently told The New Yorker magazine that he doesnt view marijuana as any more dangerous than alcohol and explained his acceptance of the Colorado and Washington initiativesIts important for it to go forward because its important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punished he told the magazineEthan Nadelmann executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance and a leading critic of the socalled war on drugs said such comments  coupled with the Justice Departments 2013 memo  have put Obama out in front of most congressmen and governorsI wouldnt call it bold but it is significant Nadelmann said of Obamas stance which has paved the way for other states to consider joining the legalization movementNadelmann drew a contrast between the marijuana movement  which he predicted would gain increasing bipartisan support  and issues such as immigration and gun control where partisan divides are pronouncedMarijuana lies at a unique intersection he said Its a civil rightscivil liberties cause and at the same time theres the emergence of a legal market that could be worth tens of billions of dollarsNeera Tanden of the Center for American Progress a liberal think tank said the changes unfolding at the state level on marriage and marijuana reflect evolving public opinion and the growing influence of 18to29yearolds Among millennials support for gay marriage and legalized pot is stronger than for other age groupsYou have a country that is diversifying and at same time you have a House of Representatives that is kind of a block against the wishes of the rising majority said Tanden the CAPs president Immigration reform passed the Senate then hit a wall on the steps of the HouseWith conservative Republicans likely to maintain power in the House for at least two more years Tanden said a statebystate approach is being pursued on some other progressivebacked issues For example measures to raise the state minimum wage will be on the Nov 4 ballot in Alaska Arkansas Nebraska and South Dakota while several cities and two states  California and Connecticut  have recently instituted policies to provide some workers with paid sick daysThese are issues that eventually will pass nationally Tanden saidConservative commentator Jonah Goldberg contends that Obama could have pushed more of his agenda through Congress if hed been more skillful politically and more willing to give Republicans a meaningful roleHe doesnt know how to play that game Goldberg said Now youve got gridlock and the things hes been able to do are things a president can do unilaterallyOthers defend Obamas effortsHis stances on marriage and marijuana will guarantee him a very strong progressive legacy said Ethan Geto a gayrights lobbyist and Democratic political consultant in New YorkHe wants to do the right thing on immigration but its an incredible minefield He pushed hard on gun control Geto said I dont see any of these major issues where he hasnt done as much as realistically expected___,2014-09-15T11:30:42Z,drugs

from a stream to a large water tankIt was just one of hundreds of illegal marijuana operations in Lake County officials said some of which have been diverting water for thousands of plantsThe scene has been repeated across Northern California Amid the states crippling drought many communities are fighting not the mere cultivation of cannabis  which is legal in the state though subject to myriad restrictions  but the growers use of water Marijuana is a thirsty plant and cultivating it at a time when California residents are subject to water restrictions has become a sticky issueWhen a statewide drought emergency was declared in January the first thing we wanted to address was water theft and marijuana said Carre Brown a supervisor in Mendocino County a major cannabis hub west of Lake CountyBy midJuly the sheriff there Thomas D Allman had already caught growers siphoning water from springs because wells had run dry too early in the season I have told my marijuana team I want you to fly the rivers fly the tributaries lets prioritize the water diversion Sheriff Allman saidIn July Lake County enacted an ordinance that demanded that growers account for their water supply as in Mendocino the county also has a tip line to identify violators Its very pointedly meant to stop a lot of what were seeing  the illegal diversions damming up of creeks tapping into springs that may be on someone elses property said Kevin Ingram the principal planner for Lake CountyLate last month federal and state agents raided the Yurok Indian Reservation in a move requested by tribal elders to halt illegal marijuana farms whose water use threatened the reservations supplyUsing Google Earth imagery the state Department of Fish and Wildlife has estimated that outdoor marijuana cultivation in Mendocino County and Humboldt County doubled between 2009 and 2012 with what the agency described as disastrous effect A marijuana plant can consume five to 10 gallons of water depending on the point in its growth cycle By comparison a head of lettuce another of Californias major crops needs about 35 gallons of waterNot all marijuana growers are cavalier about their water use Swami Chaitanya 71 has been tending  and smoking  cannabis for decades I grew my first plants in the shadow of the Bank of America in San Francisco on Telegraph Hill in the early 70s Mr Chaitanya said He adopted the name Swami Chaitanya after studies in India and prefers it to his given name which he asked not to useNow ensconced in an offthegrid farm in Mendocino County Mr Chaitanya and a few helpers produce a small crop of medical marijuana plants for an Oakland dispensary Their beds are watered daily from tanks fed by a spring on the property To minimize the environmental impact he said he recycles his wastewater This year he has also reduced the number of plants he saidMost people we know are saying Were growing less because of impending drought Mr Chaitanya said We have a responsibilityEnvironmentally minded marijuana growers say that illegal operators and water guzzlers are giving them a bad reputation Seth Little 28 an organic medicinal marijuana grower near the Lake County town of Clearlake said neighbors could be resentful They just think that were all kind of dooming everything he said and stealing everybodys water and dumping chemicals into the aquifersMr Little who has been growing marijuana for nearly five years with a special irrigation system designed to minimize water use said many fellow growers had been heedless of the water problem A large percentage of them are just really not environmentally aware theyre not in compliance he saidBut the artisanal ways of Mr Little and Mr Chaitanya can conflict with the demands of the market and sometimes the law Because there are countywide restrictions on the number of marijuana plants even legitimate growers may keep Mr Chaitanya said they have an incentive to make those plants as robust as possible  and that means using more water Mr Chaitanya suggested that the problem was exacerbated by confusing regulationsSheriff Allman of Mendocino County was skeptical of this That sounds like logic theyve made up after smoking a joint he observedBut he added the environmental offenders are not the stereotypical marijuana growerOld hippies are not our problem  old hippies get it Sheriff Allman said Theyre going organic theyre doing water reduction So are young hippies he continuedIm talking about people that move here in April grow marijuana as fast as they can until October Sheriff Allman said The 20yearold kid who wants to make his million bucks and hes using these steroid fertilizers He doesnt care about how much water he uses or what he puts in the

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/29/us/ap-us-rethinking-pot-political-money.html,DENVER   The entrepreneurs of the young US marijuana industry are taking another step into the mainstream becoming political donors who use some of their profits to support cannabisfriendly candidates and ballot questions that could bring legal pot to more statesThe political activity includes swanky fundraisers at Four Seasons hotels and art auctions at law firms And members of Congress who once politely returned the industrys contribution checks are now keeping themWere developing an industry here from the ground up If we dont contribute politically and get out there with the candidates we cant help shape what happens said Patrick McManamon head of Clevelandbased Cannasure Insurance Services which offers insurance to marijuana growers and dispensariesMedical marijuana businesses have been giving to candidates since the late 1990s With the arrival of recreational pot in Colorado and Washington the industry and its political influence are expanding rapidlyPot is now legal for medical or recreational purposes in 23 states and Washington DC More marijuana measures will be on the November ballot in Oregon Florida Alaska and the nations capital so many contributions are being funneled into those campaigns and the candidates who support themCompared with the donations of other industries or advocacy groups the political spending by marijuana businesses is modest But said Tripp Keber head of Denverbased Dixie Elixirs  Edibles which makes potinfused soda food and lotion the word is out that the marijuana industry has money to giveKeber attended a summer fundraiser for Colorado Gov John Hickenlooper who opposed legalization in 2012 but has promised to regulate the industry according to voters wishesIt was interesting to see how hes starting to evolve I said Im telling you I can get 100 people in the room who would be happy to max out or give the states maximum legal donation of 1100 Keber saidA few weeks later in August Keber threw a fundraiser at the Four Seasons in Denver with a goal of raising 16000 for Hickenlooper The event netted 40000In Washington state the industrys contributions are channeled into reforms that include reducing the tax rate on pot and kicking some marijuana revenue back to cities and counties to encourage more communities to allow dispensaries said dispensary owner John Davis who also serves as director of the Coalition for Cannabis Standards and EthicsNot long ago most marijuana entrepreneurs were trying to scrape a few dollars together to get started Keber said Now this industry is becoming profitable and were taking that profit and investing it politically There isnt a week that goes by where we dont make a political donationThe Oregon ballot measure has raised about 23 million A medicalmarijuana question in Florida has attracted nearly 6 million And the Alaska campaign has brought in about 850000 A recreational pot measure in Washington DC attracted few donations perhaps because it appears almost certain to passColorados congressional delegation alone has received some 20000 this year from the marijuana industry according to federal campaignfinance data The true figure is probably much higher because many donors do not mention the drug in campaignfinance disclosuresThe largest federal spender on marijuana advocacy is the Marijuana Policy Project which plans to donate 150000 to federal candidates this year up from 110000 in 2013 The Drug Policy Alliance and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws have also given directly to federal candidates and taxexempt industry groups such as the National Cannabis Industry Association can spend an unlimited amount of untracked moneyPoliticians who used to reject checks from promarijuana donors arent doing that anymore said Ethan Nadelmann head of the New Yorkbased Drug Policy AllianceStill the same candidates who cash the checks arent always keen to talk about it About a dozen recipients of marijuana money declined interview requests or did not return calls from The Associated PressA Colorado state lawmaker who accepts marijuanaindustry donations conceded thinking twice before taking themI always worry about what peoples perceptions will be said Rep Jonathan Singer a Democrat who is the only sitting Colorado legislator who supported legalization But it came down to Im on record for where I stood before I ever took a penny from this industryTodd Mitchem a Denver marijuana industry consultant recalled a fundraiser earlier this year thrown by a maker of cannabis vaporizer cartridges for a state legislator When the company posted photos from the event on its Facebook page the lawmaker asked that the images be taken downThey just didnt want to be seen They were still taking the money said Mitchem who declined to name the lawmakerThe only member of Congress who responded to the AP was Colorado Democratic Rep Jared Polis a longtime ally of the marijuana industry who has proposed federal legalizationAs long as this industry Is following our state marijuana laws Polis said in a

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/opinion/sunday/of-pot-and-percocet.html,PRESCRIPTION opioid painkillers like Percocet Vicodin and OxyContin have come under intense scrutiny in recent years because of the drastic rise in overdose deaths associated with their prolonged use Meanwhile access to medical marijuana has been expanding  23 states and the District of Columbia have legalized its broad medical use  and chronic or severe pain is by far the most common condition reported among people using itCould the availability of medical marijuana reduce the hazards of prescription painkillers If enough people opt to treat pain with medical marijuana instead of prescription painkillers in states where this is legal it stands to reason that states with medical marijuana laws might experience an overall decrease in opioid painkiller overdoses and deathsTo find out if this has actually happened we and our colleagues Brendan Saloner and Chinazo Cunningham studied opioid overdose deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2010 Our findings which were published on Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine suggest that this unexpected benefit of medical marijuana laws does existPinpointing the effect of laws on health is notoriously difficult For one thing states that have passed medical marijuana laws are no doubt different in important ways from states that have not passed such laws Differences in say social attitudes about drug use or overall health trends might affect rates of opioid painkiller deaths independent of whether medical marijuana is legalFurthermore from 1999 to 2010 the period of time we studied states implemented various measures in response to the threat of opioid painkiller overdoses including central registries of controlled substance prescriptions laws allowing pharmacists to request identification before filling a prescription and laws increasing oversight of pain management clinics These measures too might affect rates of opioid painkiller deaths regardless of the legality of medical marijuanaWe designed our study to allow us to compare statelevel rates of opioid painkiller overdose deaths before and after the passage of medical marijuana laws while controlling for these and other concurrent state and national trendsUsing death certificates compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention we found that the rate of prescription painkiller overdose deaths increased in all states from 1999 to 2010 But we also found that implementation of a medical marijuana law was associated with a 25 percent lower yearly rate of opioid painkiller overdose deaths on average In absolute terms we estimated that states with a medical marijuana law had a total of about 1700 fewer opioid painkiller overdose deaths in 2010 than would be expected based on trends before the laws were passedThis is the first study that we know of to suggest that medical marijuana laws could contribute to a decline in drug overdose deaths and therefore it should be read with caution Our study was not a controlled experiment and it is possible that states with and without medical marijuana laws differed over time in important ways that we did not or cannot measure and that could explain at least in part our resultsHowever if medical marijuana laws are in fact reducing opioid overdose deaths the next step is to figure out how and why That people are replacing opioid painkillers in part or entirely with medical marijuana for chronic pain treatment is one possibility Another possibility is that the availability of medical marijuana is changing the behavior of people who are addicted to and abuse or misuse opioids We know that marijuana and opioids stimulate a common receptor in the brains reward pathways but we dont know whether people who misuse or abuse opioids for recreational purposes would switch to marijuana in states where it is legal for medical purposesWe hope the results of our study will spur further scientific investigation into the effects of these laws as well as the ways in which medical marijuana can and should be used in clinical practice,2014-08-31T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/education/edlife/legally-high-marijuana-on-campus-colorado.html,In an apartment complex just outside the western edge of the University of Colorados flagship campus a 22yearold psychology major named Zach has just leaned over an expensive oil rig  a twisting glass tube that he will use to smoke shatter a hash oil concentrate Once he lights up his high will be rapid and intenseZach spends hundreds of dollars on smoking devices But he has a side income This evenings session was preceded by visits to three medical marijuana dispensaries where using his stateissued card he bought pot products to sell to friends at a markup Runners  campus argot as in running around buying for others  are an open secret on campusZach takes a seat on his overstuffed sectional and tells how it happened His first day living on campus a sophomore had taken him to a dispensary for a pizza with marijuana baked in He asked how he could get his own card and friends coached him on telling a doctor about anxiety nausea or back pain I just said I had a bike accident when I was younger and that caused lower back pain which caused nausea and that caused anxiety he recalls I was afraid it wouldnt happen so I just got all three knocked out He presented a bill mailed to his dorm as proof he was a state resident which he wasnt and received a card allowing him to access medical marijuana immediately two ounces at a timeSome of Zachs clients are under 21 and cannot buy recreational cannabis legally But others are older students who simply dont want to pay the hefty tax  three times that levied on medical marijuana So despite the abundance of recreational cannabis products since the first retail shops opened in January there is still a vibrant black market for medical marijuana which has been legal in Colorado since 2001 with a doctors recommendationTheres definitely still the demand says Zach who is on track to graduate in December He makes anywhere from a few dollars to a thousand a month depending on how much he hustles but he says that overall sales have declined a bit what with retail shops student growers and all the medical cardsIts difficult to say if students are smoking more There is no longterm data by age but statewide about 16000 18 to 24yearolds are on the medical marijuana registry Thats 14 percent of all cardholders City of Boulder tax revenue for medical marijuana for the first six months of 2014 was up 30 percent at 500000  about equal to revenue on recreational marijuanaNationally marijuana use among young adults has clearly been trending upward The percentage of college students who reported smoking within the previous year plummeted from a high of 51 percent in 1981 to a low of 265 percent in 1991 and has been zigzagging back up to some 36 percent in 2013 according to the Monitoring the Future Study at the University of Michigan Data released in September show that one of 20 college students one of 11 men gets high daily or near daily the highest rate since 1981 To put that in perspective from 1990 to 1994 fewer than one in 50 students used pot that frequentlyExperts say that the increase is surely a reflection of relaxed laws governing marijuana in some states a movement gaining momentum Floridians will face a ballot initiative on Tuesday on whether to legalize medical marijuana which is allowed in almost half the states Alaska Oregon and District of Columbia voters will decide whether to follow Colorado and Washington State where recreational marijuana has been legal since 2012The amendments ban smoking in public  on streets and in parks shops and restaurants The same holds for campuses including university housingDr Donald A Misch associate vice chancellor for health and wellness at the University of Colorado says that his main concern about the way legalization will affect students is that the industry  and associated advertising and commercialization  promotes the notion that cannabis is harmless Monitoring the Future asks high school seniors if they see great harm in smoking regularly 60 percent do not In 2005 42 percent did notDr Misch is working with other campus officials to increase awareness about the effects of the substance including its impact on learning It is not going to turn you into an ax murderer he says but what I tell people is The good news is that marijuana is in many ways better than alcohol The bad news is its not as benign as many people want you to believe Tucked away in a windowless basement room in the universitys Wardenburg Health Center three cleancut undergraduates are examining how marijuana is affecting them Breathe  a sign suggests in the softly lit room Backpacks slung to the floor the students form a restless crescent  pencils tapping legs jiggling  around a newage rug of concentric circlesDid anybody get in more trouble over the weekend asks Stephen Bentley a substance abuse counselor They hadnt The session designed to help them see the discrepancy between getting high and reaching their goals is one of three they have been mandated to attend All are under 21 and were caught smokingMarijuana citations by the campus police are in fact down  154 as of Oct 3 compared with almost 256 in the same period last year Christina Gonzales dean of students says the university is moving from a punitive stance to a more educational approach easing up on enforcement But last year 718 students who had been sent to the health center by the courts or university after a substancerelated offense mostly alcohol were found to be engaged in pot use that put them at riskMichael a sophomore from Colorado was caught over the summer in a Boulder park for possession A bike cop came up and saw me exhale He paid fines and fees of about 150 performed 24 hours of community service and had to complete Mr Bentleys threepart class If he stays out of trouble for several months the court will wipe his record clean During the summer he was smoking about five times a week but has slowed down with the start of classesMr Bentley asks the group about problems with memory which seems to resonate with Michael If I get high a number of times per week he says I notice that my memory slumps a littleMr Bentley empathizes You cant remember your car keys phoneNo its not like that If a friend tells me an answer to a problem when Im working on homework and Im not quite there yet I cant remember itSo you cant hold it in your mind Mr Bentley affirms No judgment no confrontation no labels This is the mantraMr Bentley and counselors at other universities say they are seeing a small but growing number of students who have been smoking since age 14 and are serious users He mentions dabs an exponentially powerful form of marijuana Last year he got an email from a member of the housing staff Students were wielding a butane torch in the dorm The kids were saying Were making crme brle on the hot plate Not exactly The torches heat a nail A dab of pot concentrate is placed on the head Vapors are inhaledThats the way things work in this culture says Mr Bentley who has more than 20 years in the addiction field 10 at Boulder People on the front lines are playing catchup a lot of times Word spread quickly through the staff of the potential fire hazardUniversities are searching for ways to respond to marijuana the most abused substance on campuses after alcohol But interventions are often adaptations of programs for heavy drinkers that dont capture the marijuana experience says Jason R Kilmer an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Washington In a typical program for experienced smokers students answer questions adapted from a widely used index of alcoholrelated problems Has the student ever passed out after using Got into a fight But they arent asked about eating too much coughing and problems with sleep motivation memory and attention  top unwanted effects of marijuana named in a recent survey of students by Dr Kilmer and colleagues Helping students recognize problems can prompt them to reduce consumptionSome colleges including the University of North Carolina at Wilmington Boston College and the University of Southern Indiana have been adding programs tailored to marijuana users CUBoulder offers a tier of psychoeducational options  two levels of individual sessions for mild and more serious users and a group program for moderate and heavier users For students unable to curb their use a more extensive program is being planned to help them add structure to their lives and find relaxation alternatives  yoga maybeIts a retention strategy as well Mr Bentley says Users even infrequent are more likely to drop out according to a 2013 report from the University of MarylandAlan J Budney a researcher and professor at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth ticks off academic fallout Not getting to class changing majors the B average becomes a C average  they are small things that arent disastrous but they can change the course of where you are headingResearch on universities efforts is scant Several studies have shown encouraging if shortterm results Three months after a brief intervention students from two campuses in the Northwest reported smoking less and experiencing fewer potrelated consequences ditto for Wilmington students one month after their programAt the heart of the sessions is motivational interviewing which gets students to voice their own ambivalence about their use and eventually consider changing itStudents first discuss whats good about getting high how it lubricates social interactions and dissipates boredom and stress Michael a driven computer engineering major tells Mr Bentleys group that pot helps him feel his emotions Marijuana changed my point of view on life not to take things so hard and go easier on myself And of course there are the perceptionaltering qualities Ben a junior smiles and says When youre high watching a movie or going to a concert is freaking awesomeThey also discuss whats not so good words like bad are taboo Spending too much I dont want to even think about that says Kevin the third member of the group who smoked multiple times a day as a freshman but has cut back to three or four times a week Lack of motivation scores too And anxiety If you have anxiety in your life regularly it amplifies it Ben offersAs students reveal their dislikes counselors listen intently for signs of selfmedication for anxiety depression attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder But mostly they listen for any hook that might motivate a student to cut backRelationship troubles caused by a partners disapproval of their marijuana use is a biggie says Rebecca Caldwell director of the substance abuse program in Wilmington So are slipping grades a factor motivating the three in Mr Bentleys session For an athlete it might be diminished lung capacityBecause marijuanas effects are subtle some students dont connect the dots with say feeling tired after a nights sleep Some dont want to see the connection Pot becomes part of who they are Oregon State University shut down its group program two years ago and now offers only individual sessions because participants were enabling one another says Robert C Reff director of the substance

and activist hotbed  passing strict environmental laws relaxing drug enforcement and opening one of the states first abortion clinics  getting high was not just a way to tune out but also a political statementThe only rules here are no rules Rob Pudim a resident told a Newsweek reporter in a 1980 piece entitled Where the Hip Meet to Trip The only people in town who arent comfortable he said are straight people who need boundariesThe campus still draws from afar Nearly 40 percent of its 26000 undergraduates are from out of state  a high percentage for a public university They are attracted by mountain adventure and a stunning setting The Flatirons the steep slabs of rock that dominate the landscape feel close enough to touch Many students are here because of the robust science programs CU is a member of the Association of American Universities an exclusive group of research institutions And because of its partyschool reputationOn a recent Friday a clutch of students and friends gather around a table garnished for an evening of casual indulgence beers playing cards tubes of medical marijuana and a bong All are 21 or almost there and from other statesSeveral voice sentiments that are shared in other corners of campus They didnt come here simply because its located in a permissive pot town but cannabis culture certainly played a role I could have went to a bunch of sweet public schools says Erik Mingo and I chose this one because I knew it was pretty accepted here I knew people had an open mindMr Mingo dropped out after the spring semester to work at a startup He has largely quit smoking and isnt indulging on this night I just didnt really need it anymore he explains It helped me relax and think about myself and the world and I just wasnt getting the same return His priority now is excelling at a demanding job he says I was moving on just naturally in my lifeThe campus is not under a cannabis cloud Sometimes one sees a lit joint in the open or a vape pen in class drawing ire from professors But students and others talk about a shift in how they view cannabis consumption Once an act of rebellion it no longer seems to hold symbolic power Now its just part of everyday life says Joseph Kaley 27 who graduated in 2009 and manages a Mexican restaurant on the Hill an offcampus gathering spot Mr Kaley attended three of the campuss famous April 20 smokeouts lighting up each time to protest marijuanas criminal status at the timeIn 2012 the university successfully shut down 420 saying it had grown so large it was disrupting academic life Many were angered particularly by the methods used to ward smokers away Workers spread smelly fish fertilizer on the quad and anyone without a student identification card was turned awayNew students when asked see the smokeout as a piece of quirky campus history Its just kind of fading from peoples memories says Wyatt Ryder 20 the chief of staff of the student government which last April held a symposium offering an allinclusive inside dive into the realm of cannabis cultureThe goal was to have a very nuanced discussion about marijuana said Caitlin Pratt 23 Mr Ryders colleague in student government Panelists discussed making money in the industry the effects of cannabis on the mind and efforts to legalize the substance in other states One of the most popular panels was led by Nolan Kane a CU professor attempting to map the cannabis genome to better understand marijuanas medical fuel and biotechnology potentialA few months later Mr Ryder attended a national conference for student government representatives He was accosted with questions  and jokes  about pot culture at his university Mr Ryder who doesnt even smoke was shocked to be appointed the conferences unofficial marijuana expertI

off the main drag their presence is lowkey even deferentialThe towns are not drastically different Crested Butte population 1550 is for skiers and tourists its main street is more colorfully painted more selfconsciously alpine Gunnison population 5854 has deep roots in ranching and mining Its for hunters towing ATVs students and underpaid faculty members at the university and highcaliber athletes devoted to the strenuous life A classic Gunnison sight is a 6000 mountain bike racked atop a 700 SubaruThe towns are divided by marijuana now but many in Gunnison expect a change is gonna come Voters will be deciding in November whether to legalize marijuana sales within the city limits and if so whether to tax them The city voted down medical marijuana stores in 2011 But just a year later Gunnison County which includes the city voted 67 percent in favor of Amendment 64 To many in Gunnison that is a sign that the world has turnedThis is how it feels in Colorado in Denver and beyond Even people and places not overeager to embrace marijuana are not cowed by legalization Seven months after plunging into the whatif world of legal marijuana Colorado feels years ahead of the rest of the country in cannabis understanding If you go to Colorado as many outoftown reporters have armed with adolescent stoner jokes you should know that Cheech and Chong were famous 40 years ago Many of the

refuses to exaggerate its dangers You cant get the toothpaste back in the tube he said So now were finding ways to reduce harm and continue on forward He wants marijuana taxes to be earmarked for

status of our local education institutions Those are the things that impact peoples livesGeorge Sibley a writer who came to the Gunnison Valley in the 1960s said the key to grasping local politics in

Republicanism But upvalley it was miners originally and union people and then it became posturban liberals with urban backgroundsBy this theory Crested Butte at 8885 feet breathes solidly liberal air Gunnison at 7703 feet is more in the zone of political flux Mr Sibley said he expected legalization to win which suited him fine But he said there was a silent faction in town how big he wasnt sure that would vote against marijuana shops simply to preserve the status quoI actually think itll be slow Mr Sibley said But life will not be very much different There will be a significant new tax

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/12/world/europe/12reuters-italy-marijuana.html,ROVIGO Italy Reuters  Italy legalized marijuana for medical use last year but the high cost of buying legal pot in a pharmacy meant few people signed up Now the government has found a solution get the army to grow itStarting next year a highsecurity lab in a military compound in Florence will grow cannabis for Italys health care system in an experiment the government says could bring safe legal and affordable marijuana to suffering patientsThe new army supply should allow the government to lower the price for consumers who now have to pay up to 10 times as much at a pharmacy for marijuana officially imported from Holland as they might for a bag on the street from a local drug dealerRegional health authorities are expected to offer it to qualified patients cheaply or for free helping to put mafialinked drug dealers out of business But whether large numbers sign up will depend on cultural factors in a Catholic country with an historic stigma against drugsAbout 60 km 40 miles from Venice Italys top cannabis expert agricultural scientist Gianpaolo Grassi is trying to grow the perfect pot plant on his 70hectare research farm the only place in the country authorized to grow marijuana outdoors with more than 02 percent of the psyochactive chemical THCHis breeds also blooming indoors under powerful lamps and behind armored doors are expected to be grown in the Florence military lab which already produces socalled orphan drugs to treat rare diseasesThe powerful odor from flowers in full bloom permeates the air at Grassis farm A 10foot high barbed wirecrowned fence surrounds the fields and video cameras peer along the perimeter The sophisticated system was installed a few years ago to keep out thieves who raided the farm and slashed the walls of the greenhouses to steal the plants All kids chuckles GrassiUntil the 1960s this was hemp country where a variant of cannabis was grown for centuries to make rope cloth and paperThe 57yearold researcher fondly recalls the hemp fields of his youth Later as a scientist he became fascinated with the versatility of the plantSince 2002 Grassi has experimented with about 330 different strains of medicalgrade cannabis which for millennia was used to treat pain and illness until being outlawed in most of the world in the 20th centuryFor now the military pot plan is still defined as a pilot project with details on who will qualify for treatment still to be definedItalian officials have made very clear that they dont plan to follow in the footsteps of the United States where medical marijuana laws have been followed by fullblown legalization of pot in some states including for recreational useItaly wants to make sure that curing sick people does not become an excuse to expand the use of the substance said Senator Carlo Giovanardi an outspoken Catholic antidrug campaigner Legalisation he added would lead to a society of zombiesFREE POTBecause of the bureaucracy of obtaining import permission ensuring purity and overseeing sale legal cannabis from Holland now costs about 38 euros a gram in Italian pharmacies compared to as low as 5 euros for illegal pot on the streetEven when a doctor prescribes it the state does not cover the cost which could run to around 1000 euros 1200 a month for a typical patient As a result when legalized medical marijuana arrived last year only a few dozen people signed upHealth Minister Beatrice Lorenzin said that should change once the military production begins The army should be able to produce marijuana at a high enough standard to satisfy regulators for less than half the cost of importing it allowing the government to offer it to patients at subsidized pricesAt a news conference last month announcing the army project the minister said it would be up to Italys regional governments which manage the federal healthcare system to decide how much to charge patients So far about half of Italys 20 regions have pledged to provide it for freeThere are no official estimates of how many people may end up taking medical marijuana in Italy once it becomes free or cheap enough to compete with illegal pot If everyone who could benefit from it signed up the number could be in the millions according to Grassi the researcherYet some arent so sure that the stigma of taking a drug has worn off Francesco Crestani an anaesthesiologist and president of Italys Association for Therapeutic Cannabis predicts the takers to be in the thousands because of caution within the medical community and because marijuana is generally prescribed only after a patient fails to respond to other medicinesMedical marijuana is a controversial idea in a country where the Catholic Church has powerful influence and preaches against drugs Only in recent years for example have doctors warmed to prescribing opiates and Italy still uses fewer opiatebased drugs than most European countriesCannabis is a very effective medicine but since its also a drug theres always fear to use it said Umberto Veronesi a former health minister and one of Italys top cancer physicians The same thing happened with morphine which for years no one would prescribe for the poor patients who were suffering terriblyLaws against marijuana in Italy are severe with selling or growing it a crime that could lead to imprisonment Pope Francis has spoken out against every type of drug use including potLOGICAL SOLUTIONGrassi the agricultural expert said putting marijuana production under military security was a logical solution to the political problem Some political decisions are tied to countrys Catholic mentality This solution makes growing medical cannabis agreeable for everyoneHis work should benefit people like 36yearold clothing designer Elisa Bertero who has a prescription to take medical marijuana to relieve her fibromyalgia a syndrome that causes bodywide pain in joints muscles and tendonsBertero said she tried many medicines to seek to alleviate her pain when the condition began four years ago None worked So after doing online research she tried cannabis on her own as an experiment and it was so effective she never stoppedBut Bertero said she then ran into resistance by some 10 doctors who were unwilling to prescribe marijuana even though it was legal as of last year Eventually she went to anaesthesiologist Crestani who examined her listened to her story and prescribed cannabisFor a long time I took it every day It was the only thing that allowed me to get out of bed in the morning said Bertero She now takes it only a few days a week making marijuana tea in the morning or inhaling with a vaporizer in the eveningBertero says that while cannabis makes her feel happy and light it does not get in the way of her work measuring cutting and sewing garments Sometimes she even pays the official cost of 38 euros per gram even though it is so much cheaper on the streetWhen I have the money I buy it from the pharmacy Bertero says But since Im not a millionaire I often arrange to buy it for 5 euros a gramEditing by Alessandra Galloni and Peter

it was so advanced that all he could do was to try to live out the remainder of his life in as little pain and discomfort as possible That meant taking about 30 pills a day Mr Fortune said  until his brother tried marijuanaI saw him go from 30 pills a day to almost zero he said It helped his appetite and the nausea He had a way better quality of life at the end than he would have without the cannabis It made me a proponent of the industryIt also gave Mr Fortune the idea for a business With more states legalizing marijuana for medical uses  and in Colorado and Washington recreational ones  Mr Fortune identified one of the industrys challenges packaging The old standby the resealable plastic bag was not sufficiently effective especially for a regulated industry and Mr Fortune already owned OdorNo a company that made odorproof bags for human and animal wasteMr Fortune proposed a new product odorproof and childresistant marijuana bags to OdorNos advisory board He expected the members to laugh him out of the room but they did not Every single one of them told me This is the biggest opportunity on the planet right now Follow thatIn May he licensed out production and distribution of OdorNo and he and his team began building FunkSac in Denver Although FunkSac bags are awaiting government approval Mr Fortune said he had hundreds of thousands of orders from cultivators dispensaries and wholesalers The company plans to begin delivering them this month and estimates it will have firstyear revenue of about 2 millionMr Fortune said he had been contacted by dispensaries in 17 of the 22 states where medical marijuana was legal Right now he said its like drinking from a fire hoseTo many todays cannabis industry resembles a modernday Gold Rush Troy Dayton cofounder and chief executive of the ArcView Group in San Francisco a network of 250 highnetworth investors that backs cannabis startups said more than 30 earlystage companies contact it every week In the last year he said the group sent about 12 million in funding to 14 companiesThe size of the legal cannabis industry in the United States measured by sales of the plant was 15 billion in 2013 according to ArcView which projects it will reach 26 billion in 2014 and 10 billion by 2018  figures that do not include the growing numbers of ancillary businesses The entire industry is dominated by small businesses Mr Dayton said both because it is so new and because marijuanas legality remains murky Banks for example have been reluctant to take deposits or make loans to dispensaries because the drug is still illegal under federal lawYou cant have a national business Mr Dayton said because the laws vary by state Opportunities for small businesses also exist because the stigma associated with the industry has discouraged bigger companies from getting involved You cant find another industry growing at this clip that doesnt have any major players he said That gives the little guy a chance to make a run at thisThat potential has spawned a wide array of cannabis startups  many incorporating novel technologies Potbotics in New York City has raised almost 3 million from friends and family and has three cannabisrelated products in the works including a virtual budtender known as Potbot that it expects to be available for sale next year A budtender is a dispensary worker who is knowledgeable about and sells marijuana Potbot is a robot with a tabletsize monitor that is meant to replace the budtenderThe plan is to place Potbot robots in dispensaries and medical facilities where marijuana patients can ask questions and get information Dispensary budtenders almost always have an agenda  they are trying to sell what they have most in their stock said David Goldstein a founder of the company which was started in October We created a software and technology platform that is able to talk to patients and educate them about what strains are actually best for their ailmentsA San Diego startup Herbalizer makes a small sleek vaporizer with a heating system that took three years and two engineers to develop Its cofounder and chief executive Josh Young previously designed advanced NASA computer systems and military programs Bob Pratt a cofounder and the chief technology officer was a designer of stealth bomber radar systems And yet Mr Young said the technology behind the Herbalizer has been the greatest challenge of our livesThe vaporizer heats up in seconds and uses a 32megahertz processor a 300watt halogen bulb and a temperature sensor to release active compounds in the plant selectively without creating smoke Ninety percent of Herbalizers customers use it for marijuana Mr Young said although drug paraphernalia laws prevent the device from being marketed for that purpose it is sold instead for use with herbs like peppermint and lavender The company expects firstyear revenue of more than 2 millionFundraising has been tricky for Herbalizer and similar companies Traditional investors remain leery said Christian Groh a partner and the chief operations officer at Privateer Holdings a private equity firm in Seattle that invests in cannabis startups In the US marijuana remains a Schedule I narcotic so you still have this outlaw mentality within the community he said I know theres a lot of exuberance now but I dont think were at the point where well see real institutional money or a Fortune 500 company making a play in this space Not yetIn 2011 Privateer bought Leafly a Seattle startup that provides consumer ratings and reviews of marijuana strains dispensaries and recreational shops Most dispensaries carry 20 to 50 strains Mr Groh said and the lack of standardization and consistency is a big issue Leafly has about 80000 reviews in its systemThat information has to come from the community right now because there is no WebMD for marijuana said Cy Scott one of Leaflys founders The company also offers tools for dispensaries that let them manage inventory update menus online and respond to reviews Dispensaries and recreational shops pay a monthly subscription fee of 200 to 2000 a month said Mr Scott who expects revenue this year

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/03/us/03reuters-travel-denver-marijuana.html,DENVER   This version of the Oct 2 story has been corrected to fix airport name to Colorado Springs in paragraph 5 from Denver InternationalDroves of pot tourists have flocked to Denver to sample its legal marijuana since Colorado became the first state in the country to allow recreational weed sales to adults If youre thinking of joining the visitors heading to the Mile High city this year here are a few things to keep in mindWHAT ARE THE RULESFor a start you must be aged 21 or older and be carrying a valid governmentissued photocard identification to prove itResidents with a Colorado state ID can buy up to an ounce 28 grams of marijuana at a time but as an outofstate visitor you will be restricted to purchases of a quarterounceTake note that if youre not a US citizen some pot shops which previously accepted driving licenses to admit foreigners now instead require a full passport to show a customers legal presence in the United StatesSome of the more organized stores will ask you to sign a document saying you agree to abide by Colorados marijuana laws including not providing the drug to minors nor transporting it across state borders Police set up amnesty bins at Colorado Springs Airport for anyone who forgets and try to carry their holiday weed home with themAnd remember to keep your ID handy Wary of state inspections meant to trap vendors hawking weed to minors none have yet been caught many stores will want to check it more than onceWHAT CAN I BUYThe Denver area has about 200 marijuana stores and in all of them visitors will be welcomed by the pungent aroma of green buds They tend to cost about 20 to 30 per gram and come in a huge variety of sativa indica and hybrid strains with names like Blue Dream Sour Diesel and Silverback KushFor the uninitiated or simply lazy most stores sell perfectly coned readyrolled individual joints tooMost shops also offer a wide range marijuanainfused edibles such as chocolates and candies Take care many novices and veterans alike have regretted eating too much in one goThe best advice for visitors echoed in a recent campaign here by pot activists urging responsible consumption is to start low and go slow where edibles are concernedExperts recommend you take no more than 5to10 mg  a minute quantity  total active THC tetrahydrocannabinol the mindaltering component found in pot for your first dose Then wait an hour to 90 minutes before deciding whether to take more The effects can come on slowlyMost stores also

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/opinion/sunday/high-time-the-great-colorado-weed-experiment.html,In January Colorado defied the federal government and stepped with both feet into the world of legal recreational marijuana where no state had gone beforeFor seven months Coloradans have been lawfully smoking joints and inhaling cannabis vapors chewing marijuanalaced candies and chocolates drinking cooking and lotioning with products infused with cannabis oil They are growing their own weed making their own hash oil and stocking up at dispensaries marked with green crosses and words like health wellness and natural remedies Tourists are joining in  gawking sampling and tripping in hotel rooms Business is growing taxes are flowing cannabis entrepreneurs are building investing and cashing inCannabis sales from January through May brought the state about 236 million in revenue from taxes licenses and fees That is not a huge amount in a 24 billion budget but its a lot more than zero and its money that was not pocketed by the black marketThe criminal justice system is righting itself Marijuana prosecutions are way down across the state  The Denver Post found a 77 percent drop in January from the year before Given the immense waste in dollars and young lives of unjust marijuana enforcement that far too often targets black men this may be the most hopeful trend of allThe striking thing to a visitor is how quickly the marijuana industry has receded into normality  cannabis storefronts are plentiful in Denver but not obtrusive certainly not in the way liquor stores often are Marijuanagrowing operations are in unmarked warehouses on the citys industrial edgesThe ominously predicted harms from legalization  like blight violence soaring addiction rates and other ills  remain imaginary worries Burglaries and robberies in Denver in fact are down from a year ago The surge of investment and of jobs in construction tourism and other industries on the other hand is realLegal Safe and Taxed This is what the people of Colorado voted for overwhelmingly in amending the State Constitution in 2012 to regulate marijuana like alcohol a shrewd frame that placed a major social shift firmly in the nobrainer category The promise of Amendment 64 is a flood of tax revenue for education drug abuse prevention and research  with as much as 40 million for school construction every year and 10 million for studying marijuanas therapeutic and medical benefits In a state where medical marijuana has been legal since 2000 doing little evident harm the move to legalize recreational use was seen by most voters as a sensible next stepThough Gov John Hickenlooper opposed Amendment 64 he admits that the debate is over  that this is a goodgovernment issue now and his administration is trying to making legalization work The state government began the year well prepared swiftly erecting a system to regulate the new business and to enforce the web of laws that strictly limit where you can use cannabis who can buy it and how products are made marketed and sold A digital inventory system tracks every plant from seed to sale The law forbids public consumption and selling to those under 21 Stings by state regulators recently found 100 percent of targeted shops in Denver and Pueblo complying with the underage law Police are cracking down on nuisance publicsmoking violations but arent wasting time chasing otherwiselawabiding usersTo keep stoned drivers off the roads the state is expanding to 300 the number of lawenforcement officers trained as drugrecognition experts Combating drugged driving is complicated because there are no instant roadside tests for marijuana and results might be meaningless anyway regular users can have blood concentration levels of THC the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis well over Colorados legal limit of five nanograms per milliliter and drive perfectly well and marijuana can be detectable weeks after a high has worn off Research on the dangers of mixing marijuana and driving is scant but so is evidence that legal cannabis makes the highways more dangerous The Colorado State Patrol reported in April that fatal crashes in the first quarter of 2014 were down 255 percent from the year beforeThe Problem of Edibles  Cannabis advocates were caught off guard in the first months after legalization by complaints about the risks of overdosing on cannabisinfused food and drinks Thanks to highpotency oils a single chocolate bar or bottle of soda can contain enough THC to get several people high An unwitting user may not realize this until an hour or two after eating or drinking too muchA handful of emergencyroom visits by children sickened by edibles prompted the state in May to tighten the labeling laws requiring products to be clearly marked as marijuana Last Thursday it enacted an emergency rule requiring edibles to be divided  or easily dividable  into single servings containing no more than 10 milligrams of THC But how to label single pieces of candy or keep tempting sweets away from children are lingering questionsLegalization opponents have seized on two highly publicized deaths in Colorado possibly linked to edibles  a visiting student ate some cannabis cookies and jumped off a balcony a man is accused of fatally shooting his wife after ingesting marijuana candy and possibly painkillers But these anecdotes fall short of a persuasive argument for renewed prohibition and there is still no evidence that THC even in large amounts is even close to being as lethal as alcohol or tobaccoTo discourage minors from using marijuana the state is spending 17 million on youth prevention and education An ad campaign aimed at 12 to 15yearolds who are seen as more open to persuasion than older teenagers is being unveiled this month It will focus on marijuanas potential risk to growing brains using props like giant rat cages and the slogan Dont be a lab rat The state says its deterrence campaign is honest and scientifically sound Still some critics are skeptical citing a long history of ineffective antidrug campaigns and a century of hysteria and shaky evidence about marijuanas dangersLessons Beyond the Rockies The Colorado model of medicalization and legalization is a model that is designed around continuous input and continuous adjustments said Christian Sederberg a lawyer at a Denver firm dedicated to marijuana law and advocacy Other states will be keeping a close eye on those adjustmentsWashington State which approved legalization by a ballot initiative in 2012 got its first recreational dispensaries in July It is following a different model with far stricter controls on advertising and public displays and a tight licensing process that so far has allowed relatively few marijuana stores to open with limited supplies at very high prices How well legalization will drive out illegal operations in Washington is not yet clear Seattle has such abundant and cheap blackmarket weed pot shops may end up being only a tourist noveltyThirtyfive states and the District of Columbia have laws allowing some form of medical marijuana Alaska and Oregon will put full legalization before the voters this fall Industry lobbyists are hoping to have legalization initiatives on ballots in up to six states in 2016Advocates are trying to make California one of them It was the first state to legalize medical marijuana in 1996 and thus has the longest history with an open cannabis culture Many call it de facto legalization because medical marijuana ID cards are laughably easy to get While Californias experience shows the downsides of ineffectual laws and lax enforcement it has not turned the state into a story of rampant addiction crime or community upheaval Support for full legalization there has grown as dire predictions of disaster made over two decades have not been borne outA similar dissonance exists in the Netherlands which for years has tolerated  though never legalized  recreational marijuana in order to separate users of soft drugs from users of hardcore opiates Its system is an awkward mix of tolerance and criminality The countrys cannabis cafes have to rely on blackmarket weed and as cities have grown weary of pot tourism they have tried in the face of great resistance to restrict use to residentsUruguay meanwhile recently became the first country to regulate marijuana growing and selling nationwide through a system in which the price is statecontrolled and everyone involved  sellers distributors buyers  must be a citizen and licensed by the government The goal is to end the narcotraffickers monopoly and drug violence The success of this approach and applicability to the United States has yet to be shownSo Far So Good  Beyond the challenges of edible cannabis and parental anxiety the problems facing Colorado are mostly prosaic and fixable  or out of its handsAt a cannabis conference in Denver in June some panelists were asked to consider existential threats to their industry like the danger that some future crackdown could send them all to federal prison They ruefully acknowledged that possibility but expressed hope that momentum in the states would soon become unstoppable sweeping even the executive branch and Congress in the right direction For now their experiment remains firmly on the rails and moving along with public opinion toward a future ever further from the failed war on drugsRelated Editorial Observer on the debate in two towns in Colorado

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/opinion/high-time-rules-for-the-marijuana-market.html,As voters and lawmakers in more states decide to legalize marijuana policy makers will have to answer a fresh and difficult question How should governments regulate the production and sale of the drugBeyond keeping marijuana out of the hands of minors a good regulatory system has to limit the increase in drug abuse that is likely to accompany lower prices and greater availability after legalization It should protect consumers from both dangerous and counterfeit products reducing the physical risk from a psychoactive substance And a wellregulated system should undermine and eventually eliminate the black market for marijuana which has done great damage to societyThe experiences of Colorado and Washington where sales of recreational marijuana started this year will prove instructive While there are important differences in their approaches both states have licensed businesses to grow process and sell marijuana while imposing strict rules and high taxes on them Other states that legalize will probably adopt a similar model because it resembles how the federal and state governments regulate tobacco and alcoholA Better Way to Tax Policy makers trying to regulate the drug will face challenges similar to the ones American lawmakers faced at the end of Prohibition in 1933 Like alcohol during Prohibition marijuana is widely available across the United States today But it will become much more accessible after legalization when businesses engaged in its production and sale no longer operate in the black market nor engage in violence The pretax price of the drug could fall by 90 percent after legalization according to Robert MacCoun a law professor at Stanford and fellow researchers Moreover marijuana businesses will have a financial incentive to get a broad population to use the drug regularly A recent report prepared for the Colorado Department of Revenue concluded that nearly 90 percent of the demand for marijuana in the state this year would come from only 30 percent of users those who use the drug 21 to 31 days a monthRegulators will have to design policies that allow licensed businesses to undercut the illegal market but keep prices high enough so dependence on the drug does not increase a lot One important way to curb use is to tax marijuana heavily following the postProhibition template of replacing criminalization with regulation and taxes Colorado and Washington have imposed high tax rates that are based on price much like existing sales taxes But Mark Kleiman a public policy professor at the University of California Los Angeles rightly warns that those taxes will lose their bite when prices inevitably decline as marijuana businesses become more efficient at production A better approach would be to tax the drug based on its potency  which can be measured in various ways including by the amount of the component THC in a batch  and increase the rate over time to keep up with inflationLawmakers should not repeat the mistakes they made on alcohol in recent years taxing it too lightly and allowing the industry to become highly concentrated Just two companies control about 75 percent of the American beer market today Federal excise taxes on alcohol are levied at fixed rates by volume there are different rates for liquor wine and beer For example the tax on a 31gallon barrel of beer is 18 or 5 cents per 12ounce can But those tax rates were last increased in 1991 even though the Consumer Price Index has increased 75 percent since then Most states have also kept their excise taxes steady in recent years in part because of the heavy lobbying and big money of the beverage industry The median state excise tax on beer is 20 cents per gallon or about 2 cents per 12ounce canStates with an existing medical marijuana market will also have to make sure that users are not abusing it to evade taxes In Colorado for example there are more than 111000 people with medical marijuana cards Those users can buy the drug at much lower tax rates than people buying recreational marijuana in Denver cardholders pay combined city and state taxes of 762 percent compared with the 2112 percent in taxes paid by recreational usersThe problem is that almost anyone can get a card on a doctors recommendation Regulators need to tighten access to cards and penalize doctors who churn out recommendations by the hundreds Otherwise tax rates on recreational marijuana will be easily subvertedDont Market to Minors One of the most important lessons from the countrys long battle with the tobacco industry is advertisings outsize role in creating and sustaining an addiction to nicotine particularly among teenagers and young adults Though marijuana is far less addictive than tobacco states that choose to legalize it must impose limits on the promotional activities of marijuana businesses The controls should emulate the restrictions on targeting young people banning outdoor advertising and product placements that the tobacco industry accepted as part of its settlement with state attorneys general in 1998States must require proper labeling and packaging of products that contain mindaltering substances Beau Kilmer a drug policy expert at the RAND Corporation said regulators can restrict the sale of foods like candies beverages and cookies made with marijuana or limit how much of the drugs active ingredients are in each serving The ingredients should also be distributed evenly throughout the product and regulators must test samples for harmful levels of pesticides mold and other impurities often found in illicit cannabisTo discourage the use of marijuana with alcohol states can require that they be sold in different places and ban the use of cannabis at bars and restaurants Experts say using marijuana and alcohol together is much more dangerous than using them separately  One study on the effects of marijuana use on driving published in the American Journal on Addictions in 2009 found that combining the two drugs results in impairment even at doses which would be insignificant were they of either drug aloneGrowers Shouldnt Be Sellers States should keep the production and retail sales of marijuana separate to ensure that the industry does not evolve into a group of politically and financially powerful vertically integrated businesses After Prohibition American lawmakers adopted a threetier system for the alcohol industry to make sure the country did not see the return of tied houses or bars that were either owned or beholden to brewers through loans and other financial arrangements Tied houses had encouraged excessive drinking by their customers which helped to galvanize the temperance movement Colorado initially required growers to also be retailers in the interest of getting the legal market going quickly but has since allowed them to specializeOver time the state should consider dividing production and sales as Washington has done But states should not blindly copyandpaste alcohol regulations onto marijuana either State beer distribution rules for example have unfairly prevented craft brewers from selling their products in many places a situation that shouldnt be replicated in the marijuana businessFor each level of the industry licensing systems ought to discourage the concentration of market power in the hands of a few businesses Its important for regulators to recall the American experience with the tobacco industry which is dominated by a handful of large corporations For decades those big cigarette companies undermined scientific research into the damage their products were causing and blocked sensible regulations If states allow marijuana businesses to become too big they could face corporate juggernauts that may be hard to regulateStates should also monitor each level of the industry closely including tracking how drugs move through the system This should help to keep legal marijuana from being diverted to other states or countries that have not legalized the drugWhatever states decide to do it is important that they stand ready to modify policies as legal marijuana markets evolve Policy makers have little experience regulating a fully commercial market in this drug It makes sense for states to proceed with caution and reserve the right to change course as they learn more,2014-08-05T00:00:00Z,drugs

WashingtonMr McDonald said the deck was stacked in favor of richer corporate players With banks still so leery of lending in the industry he said financing choices for smaller entrepreneurs like him are fewWhats happening is that the only people who are really going to get licenses are the ones who have somehow hidden their illegal money or legitimized it or its big business backing it and thats not how it was supposed to be Mr McDonald saidAaron Varney 38 who directs a nonprofit medical marijuana cooperative in Seattle got a 24thplace slot in the state lottery for the 21 retail marijuana locations up for grabs in his city three people ahead of him would have to wash out of the process for his number to come up He wants the industry to succeed he said but cannot fully silence what he called the selfish voice inside that hopes to get inReal close but not quite there Mr Varney said of his waiting gameDespite marijuanas outlaw reputation and legal status the industry is growing largely because the Obama administration decided last year not to oppose votes in 2012 in Colorado and Washington that legalized marijuana for personal use and laid the groundwork for statewide sales But regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission warned that the loosened laws created new horizons for fraud as small companies with dubious assets and financial disclosures leapt into the

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/fashion/marijuana-wedding-guest-colorado-and-washington-state.html,Earlier this month when Ellen Epstein arrived at the Devils Thumb Ranch in Tabernash Colo for the wedding of her friends Lauren Meisels and Bradley Melshenker she like the other guests found a gift bag waiting for her in her hotel room But rather than a guide to activities in the area or a jar of locally made honey the canvas bag contained a rolled joint a lighter and lip balm infused with mango butter and cannabis along with this note We wanted to show you some of the things we love the bestShe knew then that the wedding of her fellow Boulder residents would be just a little different from the ones she had attended in the pastThe Meisels and Melshenker nuptials looked as if their inspiration had come not from the pages of Martha Stewart Weddings but from High Times All of the floral arrangements including the brides bouquet contained a variety of white flowers mixed with marijuana buds and leaves Mr Melshenker and his groomsmen wore boutonnieres crafted out of twine and marijuana buds and Mr Melshenkers three dogs who were also in attendance wore collars made of cannabis buds eucalyptus leaves and pink ribbonsBefore going into dinner the guests were given a baby marijuana plant in a ceramic pot with their name and table assignment written on a card in green ink in the kind of stylish script you might find on a container of artisanal goat cheese The tables were named after different strains of marijuana like Blue Dream Sour Diesel and Skywalker the grooms favorite strain Ms Epstein who was seated at Skywalker said that everyone at her table where the ages ranged from 40 to 70 passed around a device similar to an electronic cigarette  except that it contained hash oil instead of nicotine It didnt feel weird or bizarre she said It kind of becomes a new cocktailWith the sale of marijuana for recreational use now legal in Colorado and Washington State pot and its various paraphernalia are becoming visible at weddings in those states  as table favors for guests like miniature vaporizers or group activites like a hookah loungeBrides and grooms even ones who say they dont partake often but want to be hospitable are giving guests choices that are much different than the standard merlot or chardonnay Now the choice could be Tangerine Haze or Grape ApeMarijuana use at weddings is out of the closet now said Kelli Bielema of Shindig Events in Seattle I did a wedding recently where they had a little box like a trinket box and it had a bunch of joints in it They just passed it around and said Here enjoy yourselfThe choice to make pot an integral if not central part of their wedding was almost a nobrainer for Mr Melshenker 32 and Ms Meisels 34 who also had an open bar Cannabis had been a major part of the couples relationship from the beginning Ms Meisels who grew up in Manhattan and Mr Melshenker who is from Maryland met in 2007 when they were both living in Los Angeles On their first date they smoked a joint together and Ms Meisels who worked at United Talent Agency at the time told Mr Melshenker she had been searching for a boyfriend who smoked potShe was like Ive been going out partying every night and I need a pothead to slow me down to cook dinners and watch movies instead of this Hollywood night life Mr Melshenker remembered Five years ago they moved together to Boulder and opened the Greenest Green a marijuana dispensary and cultivation center which they recently soldOur whole life for the last five years has been cannabis cannabis cannabis said Mr Melshenker who with Ms Meisels now operates Green Life Consulting an advisory firm for those who want to start marijuanabased businesses and 710 Labs which manufactures concentrates like hash oilMany pot enthusiasts think of alcohol as an oldfashioned oldschool toxin whose overuse can inflame family tensions and cause people to say horrible things especially at weddings In comparison marijuana they contend is more like a tonic that calms people down and makes them like each other more rather than less  perfect for a wedding they saySome of those who have attended weddings where joints bongs vaporizers epens or hookahs are passed around also say it heightens the communitybuilding mood that is inherent at a wedding At Get High Getaways a bedandbreakfast in Denver smoking pot is not only permitted but encouraged said Dale Dyke who runs the place with his wife Chastity Osborn Last March Mr Dyke and Ms Osborn hosted a wedding and reception at their inn featuring joints rolled from various strains of marijuana including Critical Mass Widow Kush and Skunk 1 The bride and groom said they love smoking marijuana but did not want to be interviewed about itEverybody was blazing the whole time said Mr Dyke who believes cannabis is a much more romantic substance than alcohol because it represents exploration rebellion openness and togetherness Marijuana intoxication is full of positive emotion People feel love and connection Every single person cried at the weddingThe rules and regulations about marijuana  particularly regarding where it is legal to use and where it is not  are still being written and constantly changing like springtime weather in the Rockies It is legal to imbibe on private property but not in public however there is endless debate about what constitutes private versus publicHeather Dwight who runs Calluna Events in Boulder and organized the MelshenkerMeisels wedding said it was difficult to find a place that would permit a joint bar or hookah lounge Even the owners of private spaces such as lofts or large houses balked It was possible to openly serve marijuana at the Get High Getaways wedding because BBs are considered private property and Mr Dyke was open to itMany of the most popular places to hold weddings in Colorado like the Denver Botanic Gardens the Denver Museum of Nature and Science and the top of Aspen Mountain forbid marijuana citing the law against consumption in public Tourists complain that marijuana is simple to buy in Colorado dispensaries are almost easier to find than Starbucks cafes but there are very few places where it is clearly legal to consume it So for now Ms Dwight said the easiest place to have a weed wedding is in your own backyardBecause they are smokeless cakes and pies with cannabis baked in are a hardtodetect way of consuming pot in public It is also illegal to do so In Washington State Alison Draisin a baker who creates what she calls medibles  because she intends them for medicinal use  said A restaurant cannot offer medibles on their menu as it stands nowEven diehard marijuana enthusiasts say the high from edibles can be incredibly powerful and longlasting Julie Dooley of Julie  Kate Baked Goods in Denver makes granola that contains THC the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana and describes the experience of ingesting a potinfused edible this way Its not like wine or a joint you might pass around for a fun party atmosphere When you eat an edible you are committed for four hours and mine can last six to 12 hours Its a long experienceAlso most edibles which include caramels lollipops and chocolates look like regular treats which makes them especially tempting for children At a wedding where a tray of pot brownies was served a few weeks ago the hired planner Kerri Butler of A Touch of Bliss in Denver said that the spaces bartenders checked the IDs of guests before handing out the brownies which had been baked by the mother of the brideJake Rosenbarger of Kim  Jakes Cakes in Boulder said he would not make a cannabis cake if asked Marijuana ruins the flavor he said and it can even ruin a wedding It can divide a room as much as pull it together he said It creates a vibe of Are you in the cool kids club or notPenni Ervin a wedding planner in Crested Butte was aghast when asked if she was working on any weddings in which pot was involved Were talking about highly professional people and I just dont see CEOs getting stoned she said Its a family event with grandma and grandpa adding and you dont want them to get shockedBefore Jennifer Beck 27 and Chase Beck 24 were married on May 3 also at the Devils Thumb Ranch they briefly discussed serving THCinfused cupcakes in addition to traditional ones Mr and Mrs Beck who founded Cannabaseio a Denver Internet company that connects customers to marijuanabased businesses ultimately decided not to include the special cupcakes in part because it was springtime the season when the rivers are raging with snowmelt and the bears are coming out of hibernation  not the ideal moment for anyone to be stoned in the mountainsHowever Mr Beck had no qualms about sharing some weed  a strain called Space Cheese to be exact  with his groomsmen after the ceremony at a private cabin he rented nearby The Space Cheese itself lent a giggly buzz to everyone while we rehashed the days events he saidToday there are budtenders think sommeliers only they work with cannabis instead of wine in every dispensary to help couples who are so inclined find the ideal strains for their weddings Bec Koop just opened a business Buds and Blossoms in Alma Colo to advise those who want to include marijuana in their centerpieces dinner salads bouquets and boutonnieres or budtonnieres as she calls themWhen it comes to marijuana she is like a skier bombing down a steep slope far more adventurous than cautious For instance during a recent conversation she suggested placing a tincture containing flavored like peppermint or vanilla THCinfused liquid next to the wedding cake for guests who might want to add a few droplets Like putting syrup on your pancakes she exclaimedMs Koop believes brides and grooms should choose their wedding weed as carefully as they select their music or clothes Certain strains help shy people get up and actually enjoy dancing in front of a crowd she said while others could bring out the carefree bubbly side of even the most ferocious BridezillasIf there are two conflicting families who are not too happy about the wedding she said you might want to find a strain that will make them a bit more euphoricKristen Tsiatsios coowner of Jubilee Event Engineers in Seattle worked on a wedding last summer that had a jazzera theme and included a cigarjoint bar set up outside the reception hallWe just walked around telling people If you go to the cigar bar there are joints underneath the table said Brandon Wagner the bridegroom Prohibition is overAs it turned out the cigar bar was like a strong undertow that drew all the guests outside Nobody was on the dance floor Ms Tsiatsios said Everyone had gone out front to get stoned and there they stayed the whole nightIt is hard to predict if pot will become more or less popular at weddings in the future Mark Buddemeyer a Colorado budtender whose nickname is actually Bud expressed doubts that marijuana would ever become widely acceptable at weddingsWeve got to get to the point where smoking is classier than drinking he said A bride blowing out a big cloud of smoke is not necessarily attractive Of course you do not have to inhale to get high anymore You could drink one of Dixie Elixirs THCinfused sparkling beverages that come in trendy flavors like pomegranate or watermelon creamOthers wonder if its really necessary for a bride and groom to heighten lighten deepen or in any way alter the experience of getting married Isnt promising to spend the rest of your life with someone enough of a high The Becks made a pact not to get stoned or tipsy before their ceremony It does change your energy Mrs Beck said It does change your ability to engage For the wedding youve got to be thereOne thing that can be said about weed weddings is they are likely to generate less waste While many centerpieces boutonnieres or bouquets are typically thrown out ones made out of marijuana buds will probably not be discardedFor the wedding at Get High Getaways Ms Osborn made the brides bouquet which included several buds of SAGE Zeta After the wedding Mr Dyke said the newly married couple hung the bouquet in a closet at home to dry it out and intend to smoke it on their wedding anniversary next year Mr Dyke likened it to the tradition to saving a piece of wedding cake in the freezer and sharing it on the first anniversaryThis practice could be a new way to relive the day As Mr Dyke put it You catch the same buzz you had on your wedding

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/20/world/americas/20reuters-uruguay-marijuana.html,MONTEVIDEO   Uruguay is struggling to roll out the commercial production and sale of marijuana and its groundbreaking experiment could be dropped or watered down if an opposition candidate wins this months presidential electionThe South American country is the worlds first to permit the cultivation distribution and use of marijuana aiming to wrest control of the trade from drug gangs while at the same regulating and even taxing its consumptionThe reform is being followed closely across Latin America where the legalization or decriminalization of some narcotics is increasingly viewed as a better way to end the violence spawned by drug trafficking than the USled war on drugsBut first Uruguay needs to work out how to ensure criminal gangs do not finance producers how to regulate the supply and quality of locally produced marijuana and how to satisfy neighboring states that legally grown dope will not be sold illegally on their streetsThe government has missed its own deadlines in implementing the changes that were passed into law last DecemberWeve been working on this since the very beginning since the first day But I just dont know if well manage it  said one government source familiar with the legalization programSebastian Sabini a lawmaker of the ruling coalition who put forward the law said its implementation required the creation of institutions that existed nowhere elseThe plan to start selling marijuana in pharmacies late this year looks unlikely as the government is still tendering cultivation licenses and identifying where seeds can be purchased fromGiven the delays leftist President Jose Mujica now faces a race against time to push through the changes before the countrys next leader takes office in MarchVoters go to the polls to elect a new president on Oct 26Mujica a 79year old exguerilla is constitutionally barred from running for a second consecutive termThe candidate for the leftwing Frente Amplio Broad Front ruling coalition Tabare Vazquez has endorsed the marijuana law though he is less enthusiastic about it than MujicaVazquezs main opponent in the tight race Luis Lacalle Pou of the centrist National Party endorsed a bill in 2010 that would have allowed personal cultivation of marijuana but he says the current reform is inapplicable in realityI am against the state producing and selling drugs and earning money with this he saidLacalle Pou who is the son of a previous president told TV station Canal 10 the law would be difficult to implement adding it meant the state abandons its role of protecting public health and trying to prevent addictionsIf Lacalle Pou wins and the marijuana law has not been rolled out he could simply shelve the project Otherwise he would have to pass a new bill overturning itEDGY SMOKERSThe Netherlands permits the sale of marijuana in coffee shops Canada allows terminally ill patients to grow and smoke their own marijuana and the US states of Washington and Colorado have legalized its cultivation and consumption but only Uruguay has passed legislation to allow commercial productionUruguay is one of Latin Americas most liberal societies and smoking marijuana has been legal here since 1998Even so opinion polls ahead of the election have shown almost two out of three Uruguayans disapprove of the state playing the role of narcotics regulatorMujicas critics say his liberal policies which also include the legalization of abortion and gay marriage have often been more widely acclaimed abroad than at homeAn opinion poll by consultancy group Factum earlier this month showed Vazquez with the support of 42 percent of voters and Lacalle Pou in second place with 32 percentWith both men projected to fall short of the absolute majority needed for a firstround victory they will likely go to a runoff where polls show them running neckandneckVazquez 74 has been largely silent on the marijuana issue and while Lacalle Pou has reiterated his opposition to the law  it has not flared into a hot campaign issue Voters are more concerned about crime health and educationThe marijuana legislation allows each household to grow up to six plants while registered users may buy up to 40 grams per person a month at pharmaciesOut of an estimated 150000 recreational smokers however only 600 have registered to be allowed to grow cannabis at homeOne of them civil servant Renzo Dodera 49 welcomes the change recalling how police last year destroyed his crop after a neighbor snitched on him But he says the law has left some pot smokers feeling uncomfortableThey feel the register can be a way of keeping track of cannabis users in a system that still discriminates against them said Dodera They are worried it may make it impossible for them to get workPricing has proved to be another headache Uruguay wants to undercut cheap Paraguayan cannabis that is often mixed with dirt and sell top grade marijuana that sells at nearly 4 per gram on the street for just 1At those prices some producers may decide there is not enough profit to make it worthwhile Uruguay received 22 applications for commercial production licenses after there were about 100 initial inquiriesStill some smokers back the governments moves and say they are unfazed by the risk of Mujica failing to see

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/opinion/Legalizing-Marijuana-Pros-and-Cons.html,To the EditorMuch of the country  with The New York Times regrettably in the vanguard  is advocating the reckless addition of a third drug marijuana to two drugs currently legal for adults alcohol and tobacco These two legal drugs are the leading causes of preventable illnessThe legal status of a drug has dramatic impact on its use In the last 30 days 52 percent of Americans 12 and older used alcohol 27 percent used tobacco and only 7 percent used marijuana The dramatically lower level of marijuana use reflects its illegal status not its appeal Why is it in our nations interest to see marijuana use climb Since when is smoking a program that we promoteThe best policy to protect public health is one that reduces not increases marijuana use There are plenty of ways to achieve this goal including a strong public education effort focused on the negative health effects of marijuanaThere are reasons why employers including the United States government prohibit marijuana use in the workplace There are reasons why marijuana emergency room admissions are reported at the rate of 1250 a day and 455000 a year and why highway crashes double for marijuana usersWe cannot ignore the negative effects that legalization would have on underage use and addiction highway safety treatment costs mental health

marijuana prohibition and for taking a courageous position in calling for national legalization I became a mother in 1971 the same year that President Nixon declared the war on drugs Twenty years

marijuana prohibition for the sake of our children and future generationsGRETCHEN BURNS BERGMAN Spring Valley Calif July 28 2014The writer is cofounder and executive director of a New PATH Parents for Addiction Treatment and HealingTo the EditorI am concerned by the editorial boards stance in favor of marijuana legalization It has been only six months since retail marijuana sales began in Colorado and just weeks since the rollout in Washington State A robust objective analysis of outcomes in these two states is the only way to determine the best policy on this issue but for now it is too early to make a sound judgmentWhat we do know is that marijuana is harmful particularly for the stilldeveloping adolescent brain As weve seen with alcohol and tobacco imposing a minimum age will probably not be enough to prevent a spike in teenage use and addictionConsidering this likely consequence not to mention the economic burden of regulating the drug and treating new problematic users we may find that the societal costs of legalization outweigh the benefits However if we make pronouncements before we see the research were jumping the gun Lets let the facts speak for themselvesHOWARD P MEITINER New York July 28 2014The writer is president and chief executive of Phoenix House a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centerTo the EditorAs your July 27 editorial Repeal Prohibition Again says There are legitimate concerns about marijuana on the development of adolescent brains For that reason we advocate the prohibition of sales to people under 21Our concern about legalization is its effect on kids Society may not do much better at enforcing this restriction on sale and marketing of marijuana to kids than we have with alcohol and tobacco Research shows that use of any of these drugs in adolescence  especially early adolescence  significantly heightens risks of substance use disorders in later lifeWe need to provide a much better prevention and treatment infrastructure which expanded access to marijuana and increasing teenage use will require That begins with limiting marijuana marketing that kids will be exposed to and equipping parents with information about the very real health risks of early useThese are not details to be sorted later but vital considerations These are the considerations that matter most to us and to most parents including  research shows  those

engineering major at the University of Puget Sound  Go make history  he said quoting his fatherHis friend Mark Rupprecht 33 standing shirtless with other prospective buyers under a blazing sun in a

Rupprecht a bartenderWashingtons experiment with licensed legal recreational marijuana began tentatively in a handful of places around the state on Tuesday with limited supplies  because licensed growers have not had time to bring in a full crop certified by the state to be Washingtongrown  but with great enthusiasm and hoopla in the places where the sales occurredWhere the experiment will lead after the novelty wears off remains deeply uncertainHardly anyone for example in a sampling of people who had come to wait for the opening of Cannabis City a 620squarefoot shop in an industrial area of south Seattle mentioned anything about actually getting high as a reason for a purchase You dont need a store for that they saidMaybe Ill have it bronzed make a trophy out of it C J Graham 22 a recent graduate in biopsychology at Tufts University who was visiting family said of his packet of potDoug Headley 34 a software engineer said he would probably divide his purchase and give it away as party favors Cannabis City was selling packets of two grams for 40 enough for two to four large cigarettes buyers said or more smaller ones though the law allows sales of up to an ounce or about 283 gramsSouvenirs for the barbecue tonight Mr Headley saidPossessing marijuana in small amounts and consuming it at home has been legal in Washington for almost two years now since voters passed Initiative 502 in 2012 and local law enforcement agencies had mostly backed off enforcing marijuana laws before that It had not however been legal to sell it for recreational purposes until TuesdayThe state issued its first retail licenses on Monday but required a 24hour quarantine period for lastminute inspectionsNonlicensed marijuana which remains illegal and medical marijuana which is still widely available are cheaper and more convenient than the marijuana from retail stores with their high state taxes  25 percent on every purchase  and security cameras many buyers saidMr Robinson for example has been using a business rather like the Avon lady that sends a person to his house with a single phone call with a suitcase of marijuana products to choose from A response time of one hour or less is guaranteedBut the sense of novelty  that opening day only comes around once  was widespread Deb Greene 65 staked out a place in front of Cannabis City on Monday wanting to be first in line

Washington State Liquor Control Board which administers recreational marijuana issued 25 retail licenses around the state on Monday with the first ones going to businesses that were both lucky  in landing a low lottery number in places that were oversubscribed with license applicants  and physically ready to open their doorsStatewide shortages of marijuana constricted things even more since the

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/10/10/business/10reuters-canada-marijuana-investors.html,TORONTOST LOUIS   US investors in Canadas medical marijuana industry are betting they will not fall under the scrutiny of US law enforcement officers  but it is a risky betWith marijuana still illegal on a federal level in the United States American investors in Canadian medical marijuana can be seen as violating the Controlled Substances Act according to some US experts And the use of the banking system to transfer the proceeds of such investments could be seen as money launderingThe US Drug Enforcement Administration has already been tracking investments made in statesanctioned marijuana business in the United States When asked by Reuters about the DEAs view of US investments in Canadian marijuana DEA spokesman Rusty Payne said the agency is most interested in those types of activitiesAfter the Reuters report shares in Canadian medical marijuana companies fell sharply at the open before recovering some ground OrganiGram Holdings Inc dropped 69 percent in early trading Bedrocan Cannabis Corp fell 42 percent and Tweed Marijuana Inc declined  28 percentUS investors have been increasingly drawn to the raft of public listings by producers that has sprung up since Canada overhauled its laws this year making it legal to buy marijuana from licensed producers with a doctors prescriptionCanadas medical marijuana market which is expected to grow more than tenfold to C13 billion in a decade has matured more rapidly than its peers While US investors have several European markets where medical marijuana is legal on their radar  Canada has been the biggest beneficiary of fund flows from US investorsWe really like the Canada model which is really unlike any other in the world said Christian Groh a cofounder of Seattlebased private equity firm Privateer Holdings one of the largest players in the medical marijuana sector What were doing here does not violate local state and federal law in CanadaPrivateer created a Canadian subsidiary as its foothold in the market Other investors however have jumped straight in from their US basesTimothy White national risk specialist for Bankers Toolbox Inc a firm that helps banks detect and report money laundering said US investors in Canadian marijuana firms could be violating drug trafficking and money laundering lawsThat is two violations of US federal law I dont see there is any way around that White saidA former DEA official who asked not to be named said that at best the investments are an extremely reckless thing to do Investors could face money laundering charges and any return on investment would have the taint of drug proceeds the former official saidIf they sought legal advice on this they were grossly underserved the former official saidThere have been no prosecutions by US authorities of investors in Canada according to legal experts who have been closely following the marketPayne the DEA spokesman said the US agency has limited investigatory resources to pursue investors and is most interested in targeting those with deep pockets who pour large sums into the industryHIGH HOPESIt is a risk many US investors eyeing healthy returns are willing to take They are counting on shifting attitudes toward marijuana in the United States and they see scant chances of prosecution under the Obama administrationThere are so many companies investing in the Canadian side and this moneylaundering risk is just not something that is coming up as an issue said one US investor in the Canadian medical marijuana market who spoke on condition of anonymityYou can invest in pharmaceutical companies whose drugs are not approved in the United States This is just another medicineCanadian producer OrganiGram has nearly doubled in value since listing on Aug 25 Meanwhile Bedrocan was the secondmost actively traded stock on the TSX venture exchange on its market debut on the same dayRoughly 30 percent of OrganiGrams shares are held by US investors Other producers also reported high levels of US investment in their shares and capital raisingTorontobased PharmaCan Capital one of the most active investors in the Canadian market and likely to go public itself said it raised about 35 percent of its capital outside CanadaSo far only relatively small US investors have been active in Canadas marijuana sector Deeppocketed institutional investors in the United States are yet to be swayed partly because of the legal risks and because the investments available are generally too small to interest them Then there is the stigma associated with the industryCanadian and US investors also have to grapple with the risk of betting in a nascent unproven market that is still finding its way Securities regulators on both sides of the border have warned investors to stay clear of speculatorsThe larger institutions have a lot to lose and face a lot of scrutiny because of everything else they do said Brian Vicente a partner at Vicente Sederberg in Denver They are not interested in taking that risk at this moment and that opens up space and opportunities for smaller firmsHopes that more US states will follow the lead of Washington and Colorado and approve ballot initiatives that make marijuana legal for adult use have boosted the ranks of investors looking at early stage marijuanarelated companies Twentythree US states have legalized medical marijuanaSome investors look at this and think Im getting in on the ground floor Im going to be part of the next Facebook of

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/29/opinion/high-time-the-injustice-of-marijuana-arrests.html,Americas fourdecade war on drugs is responsible for many casualties but the criminalization of marijuana has been perhaps the most destructive part of that war The toll can be measured in dollars  billions of which are thrown away each year in the aggressive enforcement of pointless laws It can be measured in years  whether wasted behind bars or stolen from a child who grows up fatherless And it can be measured in lives  those damaged if not destroyed by the shockingly harsh consequences that can follow even the most minor offensesIn October 2010 Bernard Noble a 45yearold trucker and father of seven with two previous nonviolent offenses was stopped on a New Orleans street with a small amount of marijuana in his pocket His sentence more than 13 yearsAt least he will be released Jeff Mizanskey a Missouri man was arrested in December 1993 for participating unknowingly he said in the purchase of a fivepound brick of marijuana Because he had two prior nonviolent marijuana convictions he was sentenced to life without paroleOutrageously long sentences are only part of the story The hundreds of thousands of people who are arrested each year but do not go to jail also suffer their arrests stay on their records for years crippling their prospects for jobs loans housing and benefits These are disproportionately people of color with marijuana criminalization hitting black communities the hardestMeanwhile police departments that presumably have far more important things to do waste an enormous amount of time and taxpayer money chasing a drug that two states have already legalized and that a majority of Americans believe should be legal everywhereA Costly Futile Strategy The absurdity starts on the street with a cop and a pair of handcuffs As the war on drugs escalated through the 1980s and 1990s so did the focus on common lowlevel offenses  what became known as broken windows policing In New York City where the strategy was introduced and remains popular today the police made fewer than 800 marijuana arrests in 1991 In 2010 they made more than 59000Nationwide the numbers are hardly better From 2001 to 2010 the police made more than 82 million marijuana arrests almost nine in 10 were for possession alone In 2011 there were more arrests for marijuana possession than for all violent crimes put togetherThe costs of this national obsession in both money and time are astonishing Each year enforcing laws on possession costs more than 36 billion according to the American Civil Liberties Union It can take a police officer many hours to arrest and book a suspect That person will often spend a night or more in the local jail and be in court multiple times to resolve the case The publicsafety payoff for all this effort is meager at best According to a 2012 Human Rights Watch report that tracked 30000 New Yorkers with no prior convictions when they were arrested for marijuana possession 90 percent had no subsequent felony convictions Only 31 percent committed a violent offenseThe strategy is also largely futile After three decades criminalization has not affected general usage about 30 million Americans use marijuana every year Meanwhile police forces across the country are strapped for cash and the more resources they devote to enforcing marijuana laws the less they have to go after serious violent crime According to FBI data more than half of all violent crimes nationwide and four in five property crimes went unsolved in 2012The Racial Disparity The sheer volume of law enforcement resources devoted to marijuana is bad enough What makes the situation far worse is racial disparity Whites and blacks use marijuana at roughly the same rates on average however blacks are 37 times more likely than whites to be arrested for possession according to a comprehensive 2013 report by the ACLUIn Iowa blacks are 83 times more likely to be arrested and in the worstoffending counties in the country they are up to 30 times more likely to be arrested The war on drugs aims its firepower overwhelmingly at AfricanAmericans on the street while white users smoke safely behind closed doorsOnly about 6 percent of marijuana cases lead to a felony conviction the rest are often treated as misdemeanors resulting in fines or probation if the charges arent dismissed completely Even so every arrest ends up on a persons record whether or not it leads to prosecution and conviction Particularly in poorer minority neighborhoods where young men are more likely to be outside and repeatedly targeted by law enforcement these arrests accumulate Before long a person can have an extensive criminal history that consists only of marijuana misdemeanors and dismissed cases That criminal history can then influence the severity of punishment for a future offense however insignificantWhile the number of people behind bars solely for possessing or selling marijuana seems relatively small  20000 to 30000 by the most recent estimates or roughly 1 percent of Americas 24 million inmates  that means nothing to people like Jeff Mizanskey who are serving breathtakingly long terms because their records contained minor previous offenses Nor does it mean anything to the vast majority of these inmates who have no history of violence about nine in 10 according to a 2006 study And as with arrests the racial disparity is vast Blacks are more than 10 times as likely as whites to go to prison for drug offenses For those on probation or parole for any offense a failed drug test on its own can lead to prison time  which means again that people can be put behind bars for smoking marijuanaEven if a person never goes to prison the conviction itself is the tip of the iceberg In a majority of states marijuana convictions  including those resulting from guilty pleas  can have lifelong consequences for employment education immigration status and family lifeA misdemeanor conviction can lead to among many other things the revocation of a professional license the suspension of a drivers license the inability to get insurance a mortgage or other bank loans the denial of access to public housing and the loss of student financial aidIn some states a felony conviction can result in a lifetime ban on voting jury service or eligibility for public benefits like food stamps People can be fired from their jobs because of a marijuana arrest Even if a judge eventually throws the case out the arrest record is often available online for a year free for any employer to look upCorrecting an Old Inequity As recently as the mid1970s politicians and the public generally agreed that marijuana abuse was handled better by treatment than by prosecution and incarceration Jimmy Carter ran for president and won while supporting decriminalization But that view lost out as the war on drugs broadened and intensified sweeping marijuana along with itIn recent years public acceptance of marijuana has grown significantly Thirtyfive states and the District of Columbia now permit some form of medical marijuana and Colorado and Washington fully legalized it for recreational use in 2012 And yet even as ganjapreneurs scramble to take economic advantage thousands of people remain behind bars or burdened by countless collateral punishments that prevent them from full and active membership in societyIn a March interview Michelle Alexander a law professor whose book The New Jim Crow articulated the drug wars deeper costs to black men in particular noted the cruel paradox at play in Colorado and Washington She pointed to 40 years of impoverished black kids getting prison time for selling weed and their families and futures destroyed and said Now white men are planning to get rich doing precisely the same thingAs pioneers in legalization those two states should set a further example by providing relief to people convicted of crimes that are no longer crimes including overturning convictions A recent ruling by a Colorado appeals court overturned two 2011 convictions because of the changed law and the states Legislature has enacted laws in the last two years to give courts more power to seal records of drug convictions and to make it easier for defendants to get jobs and housing after a conviction These are both important steps into an uncharted future,2014-07-29T00:00:00Z,drugs

towering marijuana plants checking the buds for the telltale spots of white that indicate they are ready for harvestMuch of the crop had been picked and left to dry on the roofs of stoneandwood huts that dot the valley the heart Moroccos potgrowing region Benabdallah says he openly grows the crop while understanding the risk We are regularly subject to blackmail by the gendarmes he said as he scythed through stalks and wrapped them into a bundleMoroccos marijuana farmers live in a strange limbo in which the brilliant green fields are left alone while the growers themselves face constant police harassment A new draft law may bring some reprieve It aims to legalize marijuana growing for medical and industrial uses a radical idea for a Muslim nation It could alleviate poverty and social unrest but the proposal faces stiff opposition in this conservative country as well as the suspicions of farmers themselves who think politicians can do nothing help themMorocco is joining many other countries in the world as well as some US states in reexamining drug policies and looking to some degree of legalization Moroccos situation is unusual however in that Islamic traditions create deep taboos against drugs despite the centuriesold tradition of growing marijuana in the northThere are some 80000 families in the northern Rif mountains of Morocco who make their living from growing pot according to UN estimates the region supplies nearly all of Europes hashish and is the worlds top supplier along with Afghanistan The World Customs Authority reported that in 2013 65 percent of hashish seized at customs worldwide came from Morocco Estimates vary wildly for how much the business is worth but legalization would certainly provide a substantial boost to farmers and to Moroccos anemic economy which is forecast to grow by just 25 percent this yearFor now the profits go to the buyers and smugglers who pay the farmers little for their crop and reap huge profits in Europe  where consumption in places like Amsterdams famed coffee shops has been decriminalized The trade has brought little wealth to the region with farmers saying a kilogram of kif as the plant is known locally sells for 8 and they make an average of just 3000 to 4000 a yearThey say they are completely neglected by the state  except for its police forceGrowers say that neighbors with scores to settle file anonymous complaints with authorities resulting in a visit from the paramilitary gendarmes confiscation of the crop and months or years in prison  unless a bribe can be paid Nourredine Mediane a lawmaker from the region said some 15000 people from the area are currently in detention and another 30000 are wanted by authoritiesClutching his widebrimmed straw hat one deeply lined farmer described how he learned he was wanted by police when he went to renew his national ID card in a nearby town Since then he has not left his mountainside village and relies on family members to pick up suppliesI am scared to even go to the doctor he said asking that his name not be used for fear of arrest I dont even have the national identity card and Im stuck in the villageDespite fear of arrest many locals have no choice but to grow pot The valleys rocky soil is poor and the only crop that seems to thrive is marijuana which was legal to grow under royal mandate in certain regions of the Rif until 1974 when the government passed a blanket ban on the cultivation and consumption of all drugsThe marijuana ban was passed just as European visitors to the marijuana growing regions taught the farmers to produce hashish for export to feed rising demand across the Mediterranean The ban also brought Morocco in line with the 1961 UN convention against drugs it had signedThe securitycentered approach to the problem has failed argued Mehdi Bensaid a lawmaker with the opposition Party of Authenticity and Modernity that was founded by a close associate of the king The partys draft law would keep pot consumption  widespread among young Moroccans in parts of the country  illegal but legalize productionUnder the legislation the entire crop would go to a state agency that would use it to produce new cannabisbased medications that have been developed to aid cancer and multiple sclerosis patients and eventually for industrial uses such as textiles paper and fiberboard as well Under the UN drug conventions marijuana can be legally be grown for industrial and medical uses Factories would be set up in the region to process the plant and provide jobs The statedriven industry would prevent cannabis from being turned into hash and going to the smugglersBensaid added that he has already been contacted by European and American pharmaceutical companies interested in investing in the venture if the law passes It is not clear however if there is sufficient demand for medical purposes to meet the vast supply coming from Moroccos fields And UN conventions would prevent the statesanctioned crop to be sold abroad for recreational purposesStill Bensaid sees legalization as a potential economic saviorIf Morocco has a crop that could produce these medicines that could be sold today in the US Canada and France it is an employment opportunity for citizens living in a miserable situation Bensaid told The Associated Press Its a winwin for the state because there is tax for the citizens because they are in an illegal situation and for the sick who get their medicineBensaids party is backed in its effort by Moroccos oldest political party the Istiqlal or Independence Party The two have presented a draft law to both the upper and lower houses of parliament It is unclear however if the draft is on the schedule to be debated when parliament reopens this monthThe laws have received some highprofile backing including the ministers of health and higher education who have supported the idea of using marijuana for scientific researchHowever the Islamistled government and the powerful palace have remained silent with few wanting to break a deeprooted taboo against illegal drugs While not specifically banned in Islam marijuanas effects are likened by most imams to alcohol which is banned by the religionMustapha Khalfi Moroccos government spokesman and communications minister refused to discuss the draft law pointing only to government efforts to combat drug smuggling and reduce the amount of land under cultivationMembers of the Islamist Party for Justice and Development have accused those behind the law of merely looking to boost their standing in the Rif Valley region ahead of key local elections next yearThese people are not just trying to get votes from the poor peasants in these regions but are also looking for the sympathy and money from the drug barons ahead of the 2015 elections said Abdelaziz Aftati a leading member of the Islamist partyThe growers themselves express suspicion about the plans concocted by politicians in Rabat Farmers worry that legalization would mean a fall in the already low price for their crop and competition from wealthy estates with vast acreage and the latest agricultural technologyIf legalization happened for all of Morocco we could never compete with the other farmers that have lots of land and the price of cannabis wouldnt be any different than that of carrots  wed make nothing said local activist Mohammed BenabdallahMore than any other region in Morocco the wild Rif mountains have seen little government investment in no small part due to a history of rebellions and the marijuana cultivation itselfThe locals are mostly Berbers North Africas original inhabitants rather than Arabs In the 1920s the region threw off Spanish rule and declared an independent republic that was subdued only after years of attacks by French and Spanish soldiersThe Rif revolted again in 1958 soon after Moroccos independence In the aftermath it was left poor and undeveloped with bad roads and few schools and hospitals Locals say the police dont dare to destroy all the marijuana fields for fear of provoking another uprisingSo instead the economy remains firmly anchored to marijuana Every year with the approach of the cold autumn months villagers take their dried bundles of kif place them over fine mesh and rhythmically beat them with sticks to extract a powder which is then rolled into bricks of hash Pot is still smoked by the older generation in longstemmed pipes called sebsisBy November the sheer walls of this valley will resound with the sound of tapping It is a like music said Benabdallah a festival of hashishThe government has repeatedly tried to persuade farmers to grow other crops but efforts have failed By 2010 most alternative crop programs had been suspendedWalking along terraces of rocky earth 63yearold Mohammed Fathi said he tried to grow other crops not least to fend off 32 police complaints against him He was part of a cooperative that grew olives figs and almonds but it failed due to lack of rain  and he turned back to growing potMarijuana he said resists the drought that kills other plants,2014-10-07T02:27:07Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/opinion/sunday/high-time-let-states-decide-on-marijuana.html,In 1970 at the height of his whitehot war on crime President Richard Nixon demanded that Congress pass the Controlled Substances Act to crack down on drug abuse During the debate Senator Thomas Dodd of Connecticut held up a package wrapped in lightgreen paper that he said contained 3000 worth of marijuana This substance he said caused such dreadful hallucinations in an Army sergeant in Vietnam that he called down a mortar strike on his own troops A few minutes later the Senate unanimously passed the billThat law so antique that it uses the spelling marihuana is still on the books and is the principal reason that possessing the substance in Senator Dodds package is considered illegal by the United States government Changing it wouldnt even require an act of Congress  the attorney general or the secretary of Health and Human Services could each do so  although the law should be changed to make sure that future administrations could not reimpose the banRepealing it would allow the states to decide whether to permit marijuana use and under what conditions Nearly threefourths of them have already begun to do so liberalizing their laws in defiance of the federal ban Two have legalized recreational use outright and if the federal government also recognized the growing public sentiment to legalize and regulate marijuana that would almost certainly prompt more states to follow alongThe increasing absurdity of the federal governments position is evident in the text of the Nixonera law Marihuana is listed in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act alongside some of the most dangerous and mindaltering drugs on earth ranked as high as heroin LSD and bufotenine a highly toxic and hallucinogenic toad venom that can cause cardiac arrest By contrast cocaine and methamphetamine are a notch down on the governments rankings listed in Schedule IIThat illogical distinction shows why many states have begun to disregard the federal governments archaic rules Schedule II drugs while carrying a high potential for abuse have a legitimate medical use Even meth is sold in prescription form for weight loss But according to the language of the law marijuana and the other Schedule I drugs have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United StatesStates Take the Lead No medical use That would come as news to the millions of people who have found that marijuana helped them through the pain of AIDS or the nausea and vomiting of chemotherapy or the seizures of epilepsy As of this month 35 states and the District of Columbia permit some form of marijuana consumption for medical purposes New York is one of the latest states to defy the tired edict of the Controlled Substances ActIts hard for the public to take seriously a law that says marijuana and heroin have exactly the same high potential for abuse since that ignores the vastly more addictive power of narcotics which have destroyed the lives of millions of people around the world There are no documented deaths from a marijuana overdose The 44year refusal of Congress and eight administrations to alter marijuanas place on Schedule I has made the law a laughingstock one that states are openly floutingIn addition to the medical exceptions 18 states and the District of Columbia have decriminalized marijuana generally meaning that possession of small amounts is treated like a traffic ticket or ignored Two states Colorado and Washington have gone even further and legalized it for recreational purposes two others Alaska and Oregon will decide whether to do the same later this yearThe states are taking the lead because theyre weary of locking up thousands of their own citizens for possessing a substance that has less potential for abuse and destructive behavior than alcohol A decision about what kinds of substances to permit and under what conditions belongs in the purview of the states as alcohol is handledConsuming marijuana is not a fundamental right that should be imposed on the states by the federal government in the manner of abortion rights health insurance or the freedom to marry a partner of either sex Its a choice that states should be allowed to make based on their culture and their values and its not surprising that the early adopters would be socially liberal states like Colorado and Washington while others hang back to gauge the resultsPreempted by Washington Many states are unwilling to legalize marijuana as long as possessing or growing it remains a federal crime Colorado for instance allows its largest stores to cultivate up to 10200 cannabis plants at a time But the federal penalty for growing more than 1000 plants is a minimum of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to 10 million That has created a state of confusion in which lawabiding growers in Colorado can face federal penaltiesLast August the Justice Department issued a memo saying it would not interfere with the legalization plans of Colorado and Washington as long as they met several conditions keeping marijuana out of the hands of minors or criminal gangs prohibiting its transport out of the state and enforcing prohibitions against drugged driving violence and other illegal drugs The government has also said banks can do business with marijuana sellers easing a huge problem for a growing industry But the Justice Department guidance is loose aggressive federal prosecutors can ignore it if state enforcement efforts are not sufficiently robust the memo saysThats a shaky foundation on which to build confidence in a states legalization plan More important it applies only to this moment in this presidential administration President Obamas Justice Department could change its policy at any time and so of course could the next administrationHow to End the Federal Ban Allowing states to make their own decisions on marijuana  just as they did with alcohol after the end of Prohibition in 1933  requires unambiguous federal action The most comprehensive plan to do so is a bill introduced last year by Representative Jared Polis Democrat of Colorado known as the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act It would eliminate marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act require a federal permit for growing and distributing it and have it regulated just as alcohol is now by the Food and Drug Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives An alternative bill which would not be as effective was introduced by Representative Dana Rohrabacher Republican of California as the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act It would not remove marijuana from Schedule I but would eliminate enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act against anyone acting in compliance with a state marijuana lawCongress is clearly not ready to pass either bill but there are signs that sentiments are changing A promising alliance is growing on the subject between liberal Democrats and libertarian Republicans In a surprise move in May the House voted 219 to 189 to prohibit the Drug Enforcement Administration from prosecuting people who use medical marijuana if a state has made it legal It was the first time the House had voted to liberalize a marijuana law similar measures had repeatedly failed in previous years The measures fate is uncertain in the SenateWhile waiting for Congress to evolve President Obama once a regular recreational marijuana smoker could practice some evolution of his own He could order the attorney general to conduct the study necessary to support removal of marijuana from Schedule I Earlier this year he told The New Yorker that he considered marijuana less dangerous than alcohol in its impact on individuals and made it clear that he was troubled by the disproportionate number of arrests of AfricanAmericans and Latinos on charges of possession For that reason he said he supported the Colorado and Washington experimentsIts important for it to go forward he said referring to the state legalizations because its important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punishedBut a few weeks later he told CNN that the decision on whether to change

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/opinion/high-time-times-readers-online-make-their-own-cases-for-legalizing-marijuana.html,WE learned something about New York Times online commenters recently They are far far more supportive of marijuana legalization than the average AmericanOver the last 10 days The Timess Editorial Board published a series calling for an end to the federal ban on marijuana This stance we realized was hardly avantgarde As we noted in an essay on public views a majority of Americans now favor legalizing use of the drug But this majority is not especially large 54 percent to 42 percent according to the Pew Research Centers latest pollIn the comments section of the High Time series we asked readers to state their preference for legalization against it or unsure Obviously combing through Internet comments wont yield results that are publishable in a scientific journal Still the lopsided response seems to indicate that Times readers  at least readers of the online edition  overwhelmingly believe that prohibition is pointlessAs of Tuesday afternoon roughly 15000 comments were published online on seven editorials 12658 were for 982 against and 254 unsure Not everyone chose a category And letters to the editor by contrast were far more mixedBy and large readers seem to support legalization for the same reasons the editorial writers do They are convinced marijuana is less dangerous than alcohol and tobacco and believe that the criminalization of marijuana is more likely to ruin lives than marijuana itself Arrest and incarceration for possession of a relatively harmless substance is to many readers unacceptableMark Hanna of Virginia summed up the consensus view Like many wars the war on drugs has caused too much carnage Lets responsibly legalize marijuanaKyle of Oklahoma made the same point in more detail No matter how bad you think marijuana is for kids teens or adults the fact is that arrest incarceration and the ruin they bring is worse The question is not whether marijuana is OK It is how to effectively deal with it Illegality and moral censure are and should remain separate tools  I think many people are worried about losing control of their kids but I dont think a single one of them wants to see their kid locked upAnd Justine a nurse in Portland Ore wrote from personal experience I have yet to see one patient come through our doors suffering the longterm consequence of pot use Not one Alcohol I cant even begin to count And when they do it is very ugly Patients in the ER because someone smoked a couple of joints and got violent Not so muchNot surprisingly commenters did advance arguments that the Editorial Board overlooked or touched upon only in passing Some including Daniel of Alabama supported legalization on ideological libertarian grounds I reject the federal governments right to decide what I put in my body Even if it was bad for you so what We dont ban skydiving driving in cars hunting professional backyard wrestling traveling to 3rd world countries sugary foods and beverages standing outside during thunderstorms with a metal pole swimming after eating caffeine ibuprofen alcohol cigarettes or prescription drugs all of which are statistically more likely to harm youOther readers endorsed legalization as a way to reduce the power of drug cartels Pedro a reader in Mexico City explained In Mexico we have a bloody war against drugs  This prohibition has done nothing but destroy people by putting them in jail Drug dealers killing each other for territory etc There are more cartels than there were when the prohibition started This prohibition has only empowered drug dealers I say let cannabis be free Stop benefiting the cartelsInstead of allowing gangs to profit from marijuana some readers suggested that local governments could patch up their budgets by taxing the drug In this era of dwindling coffers wrote Kelli Dunaway of St Louis it seems that the regulation sale and taxation of marijuana offers some badly needed fiscal relief In my state that may be the only argument with any impactALTHOUGH the vast majority of readers wrote in support of legalization there was of course some dissent There were readers who considered the series downright reckless and who questioned our prioritiesRobert Jackson of Denver said we need to put the needs of Americas youth ahead of the needs of people who want to get stoned He dismissed the notion that pot is a safe and harmless drug as the product of a wellfunded blitzkrieg propaganda campaign and called the argument that alcohol is more dangerous than marijuana a propaganda tactic of distraction Sam Coulter of New York was more blunt Arguing marijuana should be legal just because alcohol is legal is just plain stupidWe expected some readers to make the slipperyslope case against legalizing marijuana and they did Keval Parekh of New Jersey wrote sarcastically Sure Democrats lets fully legalize marijuana  And while were at it how about cocaine meth heroin and LSD But he also took a rather surprising position He called on Republicans to end their hypocritical stance on alcohol and tobacco  They should come out as against ALL types of drugs including alcohol and tobaccoMr Parekh was not the only reader to recommend doublingdown on prohibition Susan of Boston identified herself as someone who thinks tobacco smoking should be outlawedSomehow we dont anticipate repeal the 21st amendment ban tobacco working as a slogan on the campaign trail certainly any candidate who suggested blanket prohibition would lose The Timess readership In fact many readers argued that legalization  rather than continued or broader prohibition  was the political winner They noticed the nearunanimity in the comments section and perhaps getting a little carried away imagined hopeandchange emanating from the White HouseChris of Virginia had some advice for President Obama He should use executive authority to legalize marijuana on a national level and let each state decide their own laws This could be an opportunity for Pres Obama to cement his legacy and give the nation what it clearly desiresThe president would at least be giving a majority of Times commenters what they clearly desire,2014-08-06T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/opinion/what-science-says-about-marijuana.html,For Michele Leonhart the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration there is no difference between the health effects of marijuana and those of any other illegal drug All illegal drugs are bad for people she told Congress in 2012 refusing to say whether crack methamphetamines or prescription painkillers are more addictive or physically harmful than marijuanaHer testimony neatly illustrates the vast gap between antiquated federal law enforcement policies and the clear consensus of science that marijuana is far less harmful to human health than most other banned drugs and is less dangerous than the highly addictive but perfectly legal substances known as alcohol and tobacco Marijuana cannot lead to a fatal overdose There is little evidence that it causes cancer Its addictive properties while present are low and the myth that it leads users to more powerful drugs has long since been disprovedThat doesnt mean marijuana is harmless in fact the potency of current strains may shock those who havent tried it for decades particularly when ingested as food It can produce a serious dependency and constant use would interfere with job and school performance It needs to be kept out of the hands of minors But on balance its downsides are not reasons to impose criminal penalties on its possession particularly not in a society that permits nicotine use and celebrates drinkingMarijuanas negative health effects are arguments for the same strong regulation that has been effective in curbing abuse of legal substances Science and government have learned a great deal for example about how to keep alcohol out of the hands of minors Mandatory underage drinking laws and effective marketing campaigns have reduced underage alcohol use to 248 percent in 2011 compared with 334 percent in 1991 Cigarette use among high school students is at its lowest point ever largely thanks to tobacco taxes and growing municipal smoking limits There is already some early evidence that regulation would also help combat teen marijuana use which fell after Colorado began broadly regulating medical marijuana in 2010Comparing the Dangers As with other recreational substances marijuanas health effects depend on the frequency of use the potency and amount of marijuana consumed and the age of the consumer Casual use by adults poses little or no risk for healthy people Its effects are mostly euphoric and mild whereas alcohol turns some drinkers into barroom brawlers domestic abusers or maniacs behind the wheelAn independent scientific committee in Britain compared 20 drugs in 2010 for the harms they caused to individual users and to society as a whole through crime family breakdown absenteeism and other social ills Adding up all the damage the panel estimated that alcohol was the most harmful drug followed by heroin and crack cocaine Marijuana ranked eighth having slightly more than onefourth the harm of alcoholFederal scientists say that the damage caused by alcohol and tobacco is higher because they are legally available if marijuana were legally and easily obtainable they say the number of people suffering harm would rise However a 1995 study for the World Health Organization concluded that even if usage of marijuana increased to the levels of alcohol and tobacco it would be unlikely to produce public health effects approaching those of alcohol and tobacco in Western societiesMost of the risks of marijuana use are small to moderate in size the study said In aggregate they are unlikely to produce public health problems comparable in scale to those currently produced by alcohol and tobaccoWhile tobacco causes cancer and alcohol abuse can lead to cirrhosis no clear causal connection between marijuana and a deadly disease has been made Experts at the National Institute on Drug Abuse the scientific arm of the federal antidrug campaign published a review of the adverse health effects of marijuana in June that pointed to a few disease risks but was remarkably frank in acknowledging widespread uncertainties Though the authors believed that legalization would expose more people to health hazards they said the link to lung cancer is unclear and that it is lower than the risk of smoking tobaccoThe very heaviest users can experience symptoms of bronchitis such as wheezing and coughing but moderate smoking poses little risk A 2012 study found that smoking a joint a day for seven years was not associated with adverse effects on pulmonary function Experts say that marijuana increases the heart rate and the volume of blood pumped by the heart but that poses a risk mostly to older users who already have cardiac or other health problemsHow Addictive Is Marijuana Marijuana isnt addictive in the same sense as heroin from which withdrawal is an agonizing physical ordeal But it can interact with pleasure centers in the brain and can create a strong sense of psychological dependence that addiction experts say can be very difficult to break Heavy users may find they need to take larger and larger doses to get the effects they want When they try to stop some get withdrawal symptoms such as irritability sleeping difficulties and anxiety that are usually described as relatively mildThe American Society of Addiction Medicine the largest association of physicians specializing in addiction issued a white paper in 2012 opposing legalization because marijuana is not a safe and harmless substance and marijuana addiction is a significant health problemNonetheless that health problem is far less significant than for other substances legal and illegal The Institute of Medicine the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences said in a 1999 study that 32 percent of tobacco users become dependent as do 23 percent of heroin users 17 percent of cocaine users and 15 percent of alcohol drinkers But only 9 percent of marijuana users develop a dependenceAlthough few marijuana users develop dependence some do according to the study But they appear to be less likely to do so than users of other drugs including alcohol and nicotine and marijuana dependence appears to be less severe than dependence on other drugsTheres no need to ban a substance that has less than a third of the addictive potential of cigarettes but state governments can discourage heavy use through taxes and education campaigns and help provide treatment for those who wish to quitImpact on Young People One of the favorite arguments of legalization opponents is that marijuana is the pathway to more dangerous drugs But a wide variety of researchers have found no causal factor pushing users up the ladder of harm While 111 million Americans have tried marijuana only a third of that number have tried cocaine and only 4 percent heroin People who try marijuana are more likely than the general population to try other drugs but that doesnt mean marijuana prompted them to do soMarijuana does not appear to be a gateway drug to the extent that it is the cause or even that it is the most significant predictor of serious drug abuse the Institute of Medicine study said The real gateway drugs are tobacco and alcohol which young people turn to first before trying marijuanaIts clear though that marijuana is now far too easy for minors to obtain which remains a significant problem The brain undergoes active development until about age 21 and there is evidence that young people are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of marijuanaA longterm study based in New Zealand published in 2012 found that people who began smoking heavily in their teens and continued into adulthood lost an average of eight IQ points by age 38 that could not be fully restored A Canadian study published in 2002 also found an IQ loss among heavy schoolage users who smoked at least five joints a weekThe case is not completely settled The New Zealand study was challenged by a Norwegian researcher who said socioeconomic factors may have played a role in the IQ loss But the recent review by experts at the National Institute on Drug Abuse concluded that adults who smoked heavily in adolescence had impaired neural connections that interfered with the functioning of their brains Early and frequent marijuana use has also been associated with poor grades apathy and dropping out of school but it is unclear whether consumption triggered the poor gradesRestricting marijuana to adults is more important now that Colorado merchants are selling THC the drugs active ingredient in candy bars cookies and other edible forms likely to appeal to minors Experience in Colorado has shown that people can quickly ingest large amounts of THC that way which can produce frightening hallucinationsAlthough marijuana use had been declining among high school students for more than a decade in recent years it has started to climb in contrast to continuing declines in cigarette smoking and alcohol use Marijuana was found  alone or in combination with other drugs  in more than 455000 patients visiting emergency rooms in 2011 Nearly 70 percent of the teenagers in residential substanceabuse programs run by Phoenix House which operates drug and alcohol treatment centers in 10 states listed marijuana as their primary problemThose are challenges for regulators in any state that chooses to legalize marijuana But they are familiar challenges and they will become easier for governments to deal with once more of them bring legal marijuana under tight regulation,2014-07-31T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/opinion/high-time-federal-marijuana-ban-is-rooted-in-myth.html,The federal law that makes possession of marijuana a crime has its origins in legislation that was passed in an atmosphere of hysteria during the 1930s and that was firmly rooted in prejudices against Mexican immigrants and AfricanAmericans who were associated with marijuana use at the time This racially freighted history lives on in current federal policy which is so driven by myth and propaganda that it is almost impervious to reasonThe cannabis plant also known as hemp was widely grown in the United States for use in fabric during the mid19th century The practice of smoking it appeared in Texas border towns around 1900 brought by Mexican immigrants who cultivated cannabis as an intoxicant and for medicinal purposes as they had done at homeWithin 15 years or so it was plentiful along the Texas border and was advertised openly at grocery markets and drugstores some of which shipped small packets by mail to customers in other statesThe law enforcement view of marijuana was indelibly shaped by the fact that it was initially connected to brown people from Mexico and subsequently with black and poor communities in this country Police in Texas border towns demonized the plant in racial terms as the drug of immoral populations who were promptly labeled fiendsAs the legal scholars Richard Bonnie and Charles Whitebread explain in their authoritative history The Marihuana Conviction the drugs popularity among minorities and other groups practically ensured that it would be classified as a narcotic attributed with addictive qualities it did not have and set alongside far more dangerous drugs like heroin and morphineBy the early 1930s more than 30 states had prohibited the use of marijuana for nonmedical purposes The federal push was yet to comeThe stage for federal suppression of marijuana was set in New Orleans where a prominent doctor blamed muggleheads  as pot smokers were called  for an outbreak of robberies The city was awash in sensationalistic newspaper articles that depicted pushers hovering by the schoolhouse door turning children into addicts These stories popularized spurious notions about the drug that lingered for decades Law enforcement officials too trafficked in the assassin theory under in which killers were said to have smoked cannabis to ready themselves for murder and mayhemIn 1930 Congress consolidated the drug control effort in the Federal Bureau of Narcotics led by the endlessly resourceful commissioner Harry Jacob Anslinger who became the architect of national prohibition His case rested on two fantastical assertions that the drug caused insanity that it pushed people toward horrendous acts of criminality Others at the time argued that it was fiercely addictiveHe may not have actually believed his propaganda but he fed it by giving lurid stories to the press as a way of making a case for federal intervention This narrative had a great effect at Congressional hearings that led to the enactment of The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 which tried to eradicate the use and sale of the drug through heavy taxationMr Bonnie and Mr Whitebread report that the witness list for those hearings contained not a single person who had done significant research into the effects of cannabis Mr Anslinger testified that even a single marijuana cigarette could induce a homicidal mania prompting people to want to kill those they loved The bill passed handily President Franklin Roosevelt signed it into lawIt was not until 1951 when Congress again took up the issue that a reputable researcher was called to testify Dr Harris Isbell director of research at the Public Health Service Hospital in Lexington Ky disputed the insanity crime and addiction theories telling Congress that smoking marijuana has no unpleasant aftereffects no dependence is developed on the drug and the practice can easily be stopped at any timeDespite Dr Isbells testimony Congress ratcheted up penalties on users The states followed the federal example Louisiana for instance created sentences ranging from five to 99 years without parole or probation for sale possession or administration of narcotic drugs The rationale was not that marijuana itself was addictive  that argument was suddenly relinquished  but that it was a steppingstone to heroin addiction This passed largely without comment at the timeThe country accepted a senselessly punitive approach to sentencing as long as minorities and the poor paid the price But by the late 1960s weed had been taken up by white college students from the middle and upper classes Seeing white lives ruined by marijuana laws altered public attitudes about harsh sentencing and in 1972 the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse released a report challenging the approachThe commission concluded that criminalization was too harsh a tool to apply to personal possession even in the effort to discourage use and that the actual and potential harm of use of the drug is not great enough to justify intrusion by the criminal law into private behavior a step which our society takes only with the greatest reluctance The Nixon administration dismissed these ideasDuring the mid1970s virtually all states softened penalties for marijuana possession Thirtyfive states and the District of Columbia have made medical use of some form of the drug legal The Justice Departments recent decision not to sue states that legalize marijuana  as long as they have strong enforcement rules  eases the tension between state and federal laws only slightly but leaves a great many legal problems unresolvedThe federal government has taken a small step back from irrational enforcement But it clings to a policy that has its origins in racism and xenophobia and whose principal effect has been to ruin the lives of generations of people,2014-07-30T00:00:00Z,drugs

want to exploit itIts a gray market industry thats just how it is says Kayvan Khalatbari who owns a marijuana dispensary and a chain of pizza restaurants in DenverThe big issue the nation hasnt decided whether marijuana is a dangerous illegal drug or not much worse than tobacco or alcohol According to federal law it is an illegal narcotic like heroin with no currently accepted medical use But recent legalization pushes have made it legal  for medical use  in 23 states and Washington DC In Colorado and Washington State it can be bought just for funEntrepreneurs and investors have to navigate laws that are different from state to state and sometimes from county to county That has given rise to a bumper crop of consultants promising to show the way to success while shady public companies spin visions of fat profits Consumers now have an array of new potrelated products to choose from many of far higher quality than whats offered on the corner But they must also discern truth from hope in the many claims about all the supposedly wonderful things pot can doENTREPRENEURSKhalatbari started his first pizza restaurant with a small business loan from a bank To raise money to build a marijuanagrowing facility a bank loan wasnt an optionAlmost all banks avoid working with pot businesses because pot is illegal federally and banks want to avoid running afoul of antitrafficking laws Also residency restrictions in Colorado prevent raising money from outofstate investors in exchange for a share of the company which is exactly what most investors wantSo to build a 40000 squarefoot growing facility Khalatbari teamed with an outofstate investor who paid for construction while trying to establish residency in Colorado When that comes through the investor could get an ownership stake in the facilityKhalatbari says theres plenty of investor money sloshing around looking to fund marijuana businesses but the terms are expensive because of the risk and the restrictionsIts almost impossible not to get funding he says but its not going to be on the terms you wantOnce up and running entrepreneurs face more twists Khalatbari kept his bank account in the name of a management company instead of his marijuana dispensary called Denver Relief He was careful not to pay potrelated vendors out of the account instead using cash which is common in the pot business And he didnt make cash deposits over 10000 in order to avoid triggering suspicious activity inquiries Still three successive banks dropped him after learning the management company had ties to potWe cant be honest and open about where we can put our legal money he says They are pushing us undergroundHe has recently found an unidentified bank that will work with him and a few other pot businessesKhalatbari cant write off certain expenses the way most businesses can The Internal Revenue Service prohibits deductions for expenses incurred while selling what the federal government considers to be an illegal drug That makes his profit lower than it otherwise would be It also encourages him and other sellers to designate for tax purposes only a small portion of their stores as having anything to do with selling potThese conditions can help a business flourish once its open however Wouldbe competitors face the same hurdles to getting started  local zoning rules state regulations financing complexity or a slow bureaucracy  so it can often be some time before the established business faces a real challengeCalifornia rules are relatively lax and there are believed to be at least 500 dispensaries just in Los Angeles But Connecticut has approved only six dispensaries The first opened last month  without pot  two years after getting approval Illinois growing facilities must put up a 2 million surety bond to get approval Washington has awarded 43 licenses to sell marijuana for recreational use  and just one in Seattle called Cannabis CityKhalatbari has plenty of competition but the profit margin at his marijuana dispensary is 60 percent higher than at the pizza restaurants Even after the legal headaches its easier to make a profit selling the bud of

diseases that cannabis can treat including Alzheimers cancer and diabetesSome of the chemicals in marijuana have been tested thoroughly and found to effectively treat some conditions such as reducing

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/us/politics/medical-marijuana-research-hits-the-wall-of-federal-law.html,Nearly four years ago Dr Sue Sisley a psychiatrist at the University of Arizona sought federal approval to study marijuanas effectiveness in treating military veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder She had no idea how difficult it would beThe proposal which has the support of veterans groups was hung up at several regulatory stages requiring the researchs private sponsor to resubmit multiple times After the proposed study received final approval in March from federal health officials the lone federal supplier of research marijuana said it did not have the strains the study needed and would have to grow more  potentially delaying the project until at least early next yearThen in June the university fired Dr Sisley later citing funding and reorganization issues But Dr Sisley is convinced the real reason was her outspoken support for marijuana researchThey could never get comfortable with the idea of this controversial highprofile research happening on campus she saidDr Sisleys case is an extreme example of the obstacles and frustrations scientists face in trying to study the medical uses of marijuana Dating back to 1999 the Department of Health and Human Services has indicated it does not see much potential for developing marijuana in smoked form into an approved prescription drug In guidelines issued that year for research on medical marijuana the agency quoted from an accompanying report that stated If there is any future for marijuana as a medicine it lies in its isolated components the cannabinoids and their synthetic derivativesScientists say this position has had a chilling effect on marijuana researchThough more than one million people are thought to use the drug to treat ailments ranging from cancer to seizures to hepatitis C and chronic pain there are few rigorous studies showing whether the drug is a fruitful treatment for those or any other conditionsA major reason is this The federal government categorizes marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug the most restrictive of five groups established by the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 Drugs in this category  including heroin LSD peyote and Ecstasy  are considered to have no accepted medical use in the United States and a high potential for abuse and are subject to tight restrictions on scientific studyIn the case of marijuana those restrictions are even greater than for other controlled substances Marijuana remains illegal under federal law though nearly half the states and the District of Columbia allow its medical use and two Colorado and Washington have legalized its recreational useTo obtain the drug legally researchers like Dr Sisley must apply to the Food and Drug Administration the Drug Enforcement Administration and the National Institute on Drug Abuse  which citing a 1961 treaty obligation administers the only legal source of the drug for federally sanctioned research at the University of Mississippi Dr Sisleys proposed study also had to undergo an additional layer of review from the Public Health Service that is not required for other controlled substances in such researchThe process is so cumbersome that a growing number of elected state officials medical experts and members of Congress have started calling for loosening the restrictions In June a letter signed by 30 members of Congress including four Republicans called the extra scrutiny of marijuana projects unnecessary saying that research has often been hampered by federal barriersIt defies logic in this day and age that marijuana is still in Schedule 1 alongside heroin and LSD when there is so much testimony to what relief medical marijuana can bring Gov Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island said in an interview In late 2011 he and the governor of Washington at the time Christine O Gregoire filed a petition asking the federal government to place the drug in a lower category The petition is still pending with the DEADespite the mounting push there is little evidence that either Congress or the Obama administration will change marijuanas status soon In public statements DEA officials have made their displeasure known about states legalizing medical and recreational marijuanaThe agencys position seems at odds with that of President Obama whose Justice Department has allowed states to legalize either medical or recreational marijuana as long as they follow certain federal priorities such as not allowing sales to juveniles Mr Obama has also said that he believes marijuana is no more dangerous than alcohol and that he is bothered by the disproportionate number of minorities incarcerated for possession of the drugAsked if there was an inconsistency between the presidents stance and that of the Drug Enforcement Administration a White House spokesman Matt Lehrich said The administrations policy continues to be that while the prosecution of drug traffickers remains an important priority targeting individual marijuana users is not the best allocation of federal law enforcement resources The DEA is carrying out that policyThere are signs though of a possible shift in attitude within the federal government In May the DEA issued new rules to increase the governments production of marijuana for research this year to 650000 grams from 21000 gramsAnd at the National Institute on Drug Abuse for instance records show that at the beginning of this year there were 28 active grants for research into the possible medical benefits of marijuana in six disease categoriesMost of the studies focus on the potential therapeutic uses of individual cannabinoid chemicals from marijuana or synthetic versions and not the plant itself Furthermore a dozen or so of those studies are being conducted with animals and not humansAdditionally other National Institutes of Health entities have been supporting marijuana research As for independently funded marijuana research the federal government has cleared 16 projects since 1999 13 of them at the University of California San DiegoMoving the drug to a less restrictive category could do more than reduce some obstacles to research proponents say It would be a significant step toward allowing doctors around the country to prescribe the drug Federal lawmakers say it could also permit medical marijuana operations that are legal at the state level to take business deductions on their federal taxesDr Sisleys predicament shows that even in states like Arizona where medical marijuana is legal the matter remains politically volatile Last month Arizona authorized the use of marijuana for patients undergoing conventional treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder Dr Sisleys study is supposed to use five different strains of marijuana that would be smoked or vaporized by 70 veterans The goal is to develop a marijuana drug in plant form that would be smoked or vaporized approved by the Food and Drug AdministrationHer firing seemed to stem from a fight over money In March the Arizona House passed a Republicansponsored bill designed to provide her project with some funding from fees collected in the states medical marijuana program But the measure died when State Senator Kimberly Yee a Republican who is the chairwoman of the Education Committee refused to put the legislation on the panels agenda Ms Yee said at the time that she preferred the funds be used for antidrug educationAngry about her opposition to the bill a group of veterans began a recall effort against Ms Yee Some of those veterans had been treated by Dr Sisley in the past and Senate leaders concluded that Dr Sisley herself was involved in the campaignThe State Senate president Andrew Biggs called the universitys chief lobbyist Tim Bee to complain that Dr Sisley seemed to be lobbying too aggressively and inappropriately Tim said he would call me back after he found out more Mr Biggs said in an interview And then he did and told me This will not be a problem going forwardIn April a university vice president who said he was calling on behalf of the president Ann Weaver Hart told Dr Sisley that Mr Biggs thought she should resign Dr Sisley recounted In June she received a letter from the university saying her annual employment contract would not be renewed as of Sept 26Dr Sisley denied participating in the recall effort She acknowledged talking to senators and their aides about funding but as a member of the Arizona Medical Association The university could not take the political heat from the hyperconservative legislators and fired me and deserted all these veterans who have been fighting alongside me for years she saidA university spokesman Chris W Sigurdson said that while university policy prevented him from discussing specifics about Dr Sisleys case the school had not been pressured to fire her Mr Biggs also denied trying to get her fired He added that the university had proposed that another faculty member take over the project as lead investigatorLate last month the university notified Dr Sisley that it had denied her appeal for reinstatement Rick Doblin founder and executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies which is sponsoring Dr Sisleys research said he would now try to persuade the Arizona Board of Regents to allow the study to continue at another state institute with Dr Sisley as the lead investigatorMr Doblin said he was committed to staying with her as the lead investigator and would help her look for an alternate research location A switch to a new study location would require further regulatory review for the proposed research which still needs another approval from the DEA Mr Doblin

Vincent C Gray urged district residents to boycott the beaches and resort towns of Marylands Eastern Shore after its congressman moved to block the citys marijuanafriendly law claiming more teenagers will take up drug useHe is interfering with democracy in this city and we want people to understand how we feel about it the mayor said in an interview He pointed out that Maryland like the district decriminalized marijuana this year and if the congressman Representative Andy Harris had been in the legislature he would have been outvotedMarijuana has potent political symbolism in this city with a large black population because the vast majority of arrests here for possession is of blacks But at issue is more than marijuana Infringements on Washingtons home rule hits an eversensitive nerve setting off howls of hypocrisy and tyranny in a city whose license plates read Taxation Without RepresentationA city of liberal voters the district has long had prickly relations with conservative members of Congress who set up parttime housekeeping here and thanks to the Constitution get a big say in local affairsThese are things people cant even do in their own home states and they use the District of Columbia to make an example out of us Mr Gray saidCity officials accuse federal lawmakers of grandstanding for voters back home or nationallyTheres a long tradition of people trying to score points off of us said David Catania a District of Columbia council memberIn recent years conservative Republicans have stopped the city from implementing a needle exchange program to slow the spread of HIV a registry of gay domestic partners and medical marijuana All eventually went forward sometimes after a decade of obstructionMr Catania accused Mr Harris of seeking to enhance his bona fides in a campaign for leadership of the Republican Study Committee a group that seeks to pull the House further right The chairmanship opened in a House leadership shuffle after the primary defeat of Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia who resigned as majority leader Mr Harris who is a physician won his seat in 2010 after a State Senate career in which he was known for opposing lateterm abortions as well as Xrated movies at the University of MarylandHe denied a political motive in opposing marijuana decriminalization If I were looking to advance my position among the broad spectrum of Republicans this is probably not the way to do it he saidHis objection to the districts law is because it reduces the penalty for possession of up to one ounce of marijuana to a 25 civil fine  a trivial sum in his view which he predicted would entice more teenagers to drug use One ounce can be almost 100 joints he said That is not a small amountSociety has some responsibility for protecting minors he added I think the DC law protects them in no way shape or formThe law passed in a 101 council vote in March Supporters cited a study showing a racial disparity in enforcing marijuana laws 90 percent of Washingtonians arrested on charges of possession were black in a city where blacks are 50 percent of the populationMr Harriss effort to block the law came in the form of an amendment to a spending bill which passed the House Appropriations Committee The rider would stop the district from using its tax revenues to enforce decriminalization The measure must survive a full House vote and in an unlikely scenario a joint conference with the Democratcontrolled SenateAttaching budget riders is a backdoor way for lawmakers to block local laws an authority granted to Congress in Article 1 of the Constitution The more straightforward and rarely successful path is a joint resolution of Congress overturning a district law Because Congress has not moved to do that within the required window of 60 legislative days the law is scheduled to take effect this weekIf Mr Harriss rider later becomes law it would make the citys decriminalization a brief interludeDistrict officials while acknowledging the constitutional authority of Congress denounced its interference as undemocraticShouldnt the people of the District of Columbia in a democracy be permitted to make decisions Mr Gray said We have more people in the District of Columbia than in the whole state of Wyoming or in Vermont I cant imagine Representative Harris feels he ought to interfere in the business of those two statesMichael K Fauntroy a political scientist at Howard University who has written extensively on Washington home rule said Congress has not stepped in as often in recent years as during a volatile period in the citys management before 2000But its still a tinderbox and it wouldnt take much to get Congress back involved he saidOne possible spark The citys move to go beyond marijuana decriminalization to full legalization This week activists presented signatures to qualify a referendum for the November ballot that would legalize possession of up to two ounces of pot for personal use and the right to grow three marijuana plants at homePassage of the measure Initiative 71 would put the city in the vanguard of promarijuana jurisdictions including two Western states Colorado and Washington where legal retailers selling recreational marijuana opened this yearThe District of Columbias referendum would not allow sales But the prospect of marijuana plants bending to the sun in the windows of Capitol Hill rowhouses might prove too great a provocation to many lawmakersI think Congress would step in to overturn it Mr Fauntroy said Especially if Republicans take control of the SenateHowever in the face of a sweltering summer it does not appear that many residents have heeded the mayors call to skip their traditional visits to the Eastern Shore beaches and bay towns in Mr

in peaceEven as Amsterdam has wrestled with drug tourism in recent years reducing the number of coffee shops where it is legal to buy and smoke marijuana and hashish about 300 new cannabis clubs have opened in Barcelona and the surrounding Catalan region a result at least in part of enterprising Spaniards looking for new ways to earn a living experts sayIt is not that Barcelona officials have given their blessing to this new phenomenon The clubs are operating under decadesold Spanish laws that allow anyone to grow and smoke marijuana in private or to band together with others to form a cannabis club as long as it is a nonprofit organization for members only something like a chess or a cooking clubBut in the last three years new clubs have opened particularly in tourist areas like La Rambla in many cases circumventing the spirit if not the letter of the law While some clubs refuse walkin customers like the German college students many of them offer membership about 20 euros or about 27 over the Internet or by phoneThe clubs vary enormously from basement rooms equipped with foosball tables and huge television sets to more elegant settings with designer chandeliers and fresh fruit drink bars Some give marijuana away to those who use it for medical purposes and see a business in this area Others cater only to recreational users Few of the clubs are noticeable from the streetThe Rambla Dragon Club for instance which opened last year is on the ground floor of an apartment building Only a small sign over the doorbell as well as the constant presence of young people squinting to read it indicates its presence It has the feel of a Starbucks without windows its high ceilings and a mighty ventilation system keeping the air fresh Some of the smokers sit at tables with their laptops open Others sit in on sofas watching movies on a giant screenSome cannabis advocates say the clubs are a bright spot in the economy Though they are nonprofits advocates say the clubs are generating thousands of jobs and tax revenues for the state In addition to selling a wide array of cannabis products and hashish many of the clubs also sell food and drinks and offer extras to their members like live music nights and Pilates classesAlbert Ti the president of Fedcac an association of cannabis clubs in the region of Catalonia that includes Barcelona said the clubs now had 165000 members up from virtually none five years ago His association was formed in 2011 with only a handful of clubs in existence he saidOne reason for the growth he said was that young people saw the clubs as a way to make a living Another factor he said was Barcelonas new antismoking laws which went into effect in bars and restaurants in January 2011 and sent cannabis smokers who are often also tobacco smokers looking for new places to congregateThe reality is this Mr Ti said Consumers think this is better than buying drugs on the streetRegional officials say that many of the clubs do cater mostly to Spaniards including one club in which all the members are women in their 80s But Barcelona officials are so concerned about the rapid increase in such establishments and this citys growing reputation as a place to get a legal high that they decided in June to put a oneyear moratorium on new licenses while they consider issues such as proximity to schoolsYes its a problem said Joan Delort the head of prevention security and mobility for Barcelona In a very few years you have a huge registration of cannabis users It is very hard to determine what is really going on But in 18 months you have clubs that are in a very small location that have registered 4000 members Its just impossible that they could have that manySome of the biggest names in the marijuana world are here The Strain Hunters for instance a Dutch group that makes documentaries about the hunt for native strains of marijuana around the world opened a club here in March on a charming side street not far from La RamblaWith oneway windows that give the space an open and airy feel but prevents passersby from looking in it has the look and the feel of an upscale bar For those who want to get an early start coffee and fresh croissants are available for breakfast and members can opt for rarer cannabis products such as pure cannabis resin in the shape of a butterflyWebsites that review the clubs such as MarijuanaGamesorg and WeBeHighorg are giving Barcelona clubs high marks for both the quality and the variety of cannabis products they sell as well as for offering a far more pleasant atmosphere than most Amsterdam coffee shops which they say usually offer stale marijuanaOn a recent morning Olivier Vervaet a 21yearold nightclub worker was at the Strain Hunters Club looking over the cannabis menu while having a coffee I joined because this was just a great place to relax he said I can sit down and someone will bring me a drink and a joint and I dont have to worry about the policeA few times a month the police have stepped in taking action against clubs caught leafleting on the street for instance But Edward Sallent the inspector general of community policing for the Catalan regional police said it was difficult to move against the clubs Its a complex situation because a lot of the acts and behaviors are not forbidden he said Selling and trafficking are illegal but consumption noMany advocates say they believe the clubs are cutting down on street sales But Mr Sallent says he doubts that He says the clubs are too new to know exactly what impact they will have There may be all kinds of costs he said Maybe it will affect the value of property Who knowsSome of those involved in managing the clubs in Barcelona hope that Spain will go further in legalizing marijuana soon Though the clubs are run as nonprofit entities some clearly represent big investments One such club RMD has set up an area for members who use marijuana to soothe the effects of chemotherapy or for other medical purposesIt even hired a doctor to discuss their marijuana use and to help them with any issues that might arise Tony Levi who coordinates this aspect of the club said he became interested in the medical benefits of cannabis when his father had cancerHe says he believes that eventually Spain will recognize cannabis for medical use and that the services the club is providing will be covered by insurance I do see a business model here he said,2014-07-11T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/07/us/07potshop.html,VANCOUVER Wash   John Larson a recently retired high school science and math teacher hopes to be in the first wave of legal recreational marijuana salespeople opening shop here in Washington State this weekMr Larson 67 who was talked into the venture by his children said he had never tried marijuana and in fact voted against legalizing it in 2012 But as a business idea  well thats differentIf people were dumb enough to vote it in Im all for it he said over a cup of coffee near his shop here in southern Washington just across the Columbia River from Portland Ore Theres a demand and I have a productAfter nearly two years of anticipation excitement and dread by stilldivided Washington residents the first licenses for legal sale of recreational marijuana will be issued Monday state officials said Sales are to start about 24 hours laterBut the rollout is not unfolding as anyone quite expected it to from the seemingly unlikely businesspeople like Mr Larson who are leading the charge to the downright odd pattern of where the first shops will openSeattle for example with a population of 652000 the states largest city and perhaps most marijuanafriendly will have only a single store initially and a tiny one at that 620 square feet called Cannabis City But Vancouver about onefourth Seattles size in a largely conservative county that has tried to slow or stop marijuana businesses with strict landuse rules could have three shops Tacoma also in a county that has tried to block marijuana businesses may have fourThe pattern came down to chance and circumstance said Mikhail Carpenter a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board which wrote the regulations and administers the system With multiple inspections and requirements to meet a lot of people werent ready Mr Carpenter saidOnly about 20 licenses out of 334 authorized by the regulations will be granted in this first wave Mr Carpenter said with many wouldbe operators slowed by financing troubles inspection questions or other issues Mr Larson for example applied for three licenses in three cities and two were denied in each case because state inspectors said the boundary line was too close to a licensed day care centerHe disagreed but quickly gave up You cant argue with the stateAnd even the shops that open will not have that much to sell because marijuana growers got their licenses only in March not enough time to produce a big crop Mr Larson expects to have perhaps two pounds which he expects could be gone in hours and no edible products at all since no statelicensed marijuana food producers are up and runningSome retailers said they planned to ration supplies in the early days allowing customers to buy only a small fraction of the ounce that the law allows for adults over 21Low supply in turn means high prices at least at first with an ounce  should anyone even be able to buy one  expected to cost at least 400 That is much more than a buyer would typically pay on the black market here in Washington according to The Price of Weed a website that surveys marijuana prices by stateBut in some ways people like Mr Larson put the most distinctive stamp on Washingtons halting first steps Voters in Colorado approved marijuana legalization at the same time that Washington did in 2012 but then went down a much different regulatory path that pushed things faster with stores open since JanuaryColorado also created the first recreational marijuana shops from the medical marijuana dispensaries that were already in business which meant that many of the first wave of operators were already in the marijuana tradeWashington by contrast started from scratch throwing open the application process and giving medical marijuana dispensary operators no edge in the competition for licensesIn the little town of Prosser population 5800 in south central Washington for example two chiropractors formed a partnership and hope to open this week In Seattle a former restaurant and bar owner is expected to get the first licenseRamsey Hamide a manager of Main Street Marijuana a shop here in downtown Vancouver that plans to open Wednesday came into the business from the concert ticket industry He and the other manager Chris Stipe are setting up shop in a former jewelry store after visiting more than 20 shops in Colorado to look for ideasWe saw what to do  and also what not to do Mr Hamide said Anything that felt confining in particular  security doors and waiting areas for access into the product displays a common setup for medical dispensaries  was rejected he saidKeep it light open and friendly he said of their design planAnd while many of the new business operators are brimming with optimism about the new market others say the road ahead might be harder than people want to believe Protesters in Prosser for example have been regularly picketing the chiropractic office of Tim Thompson a coowner of the towns marijuana shop Altitude carrying signs with slogans like God Judges SinInitiative 502 which legalized recreational marijuana passed with 55 percent of the vote statewide but lost in much of central and eastern WashingtonThey camp out in front of my office every day Mr Thompson said in a telephone interviewMr Larson who said his son had also gone into the business as a grower is also braced for a legal fight even as sales begin His shop has a Vancouver address and the city has been accepting marijuana businesses he said but the shop is on the boundary with an unincorporated area of Clark County where different rules apply So Mr Larson said he planned to be ready go to court on the opening day of business to fend off any efforts to close him downWhatever happens though he said will certainly make for an interesting adventure and after 35 years of teaching he said he was readyMy retirement date is when they close the lid on my coffin he said,2014-07-07T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/13/us/politics/ap-us-rethinking-pot-nations-capital.html,WASHINGTON   A debate over legalizing marijuana in the nations capital is focusing on the outsized number of arrests of African Americans on minor drug chargesPot legalization supporters in Colorado and Washington state also spoke about racial justice but their voters are mostly white and their campaigns focused more on other issues The race factor hits closer to many more homes in the District where nearly half the population is blackAnd that means this referendum could change how the nation talks about marijuana some drugpolicy experts sayI think DC is going to probably set off a chain of events in which communities of color generally and cities in particular take on the issue of legalization as a racial justice social justice issue in a much stronger way than they have so far said Bill Piper director of national affairs at the Drug Policy AllianceThere are many other differences between the District and states that have legalized pot The city is a patchwork of local and federal land and there will be no lighting up in front of the White House or at the Jefferson Memorial Also Washington remains under the thumb of Congress which could thwart the will of the voters as it has on other matters where liberal District tendencies clash with conservative priorities on Capitol HillNonetheless the District is on track to join Colorado and Washington state in legalizing marijuana A poll last month showed nearly 2 of every 3 voters favor the initiative which will be on Novembers ballot Voters in Alaska and Oregon also decide this fall whether to legalize potRoughly half of the Districts 646000 residents are black The American Civil Liberties Union found that in 2010 blacks were eight times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession in the District and 91 percent of those arrested that year were blackIt would alleviate a lot of problems said Kenneth Agee 46 a heating and air conditioning mechanic who plans to vote for legalization There may be less violence on the streets associated with marijuana trafficking and salesThe DC Council tried earlier this year to address racial disparities by decriminalizing marijuana as 17 states have done Possession of up to one ounce of pot in the District is now subject to a 25 fine among the lowest in the nation The law took effect in July despite an attempt by Rep Andy Harris a Maryland Republican to block the measureLegalization advocates say decriminalization hasnt done enough citing police statistics that show most of the 25 tickets are being handed out in predominantly black neighborhoodsWe can tell the police Guess what Its not even a crime You dont have to write a ticket said Adam Eidinger chairman of the DC Cannabis Campaign the group that crafted the initiative and got it on the ballotThe initiative also is notable for what it lacks Because ballot initiatives in the District cant affect the budget it does not provide for the legal sale of marijuana or set up a system to tax and regulate it That would be up to the mayor and the council Voters will also be choosing a new mayor in November to replace Vincent Gray and both leading candidates have said they support legalizationIn Colorado and Washington state the federal government said legal pot must be kept off federal property such as parks and other huge swaths of US land That could be more complicated in the District where the situation can change from block to block The parkland the federal government owns in the District for instance includes 59 innercity squares and trianglesBecause Congress has authority over lawmaking in the District the initiative wouldnt take effect until a congressional review period that could last several months The triedandtrue tactic for members of Congress who want to undo local laws in the District is to attach an amendment to a crucial piece of legislation such as a spending bill that funds the federal government Thats how Congress banned medical marijuana in the city for more than a decade after voters approved it Medical marijuana is now availableHarris said in a statement that he would consider using all resources available to a member of Congress to stop legalization If he attaches an amendment to a major bill its fate could depend on negotiations between the House Senate and White House The District hasnt always been the winner in such deals even during President Barack Obamas tenureSome voters remain skeptical of legalization out of concern that marijuana is harmful to young people Leaders of an antilegalization group known as Two Is Enough DC argue that District residents already suffer too much from drinking and smoking and dont need another legal drugWhere are the liquor stores in DC Theyre in the poorer communities theyre in the communities of color Theres more cigarette tobacco advertising in our community said Will Jones III the groups lead organizer Marijuana has been used to unfairly target our community Nevertheless to say that if we have it legal thats going to deal with the problem I dont understand that logic___,2014-10-13T14:20:19Z,drugs

challenge that their predecessors in Colorado and Washington state didnt face two years ago  increasing turnout of young voters in a midterm electionYoung voters who as a generation are more likely to support recreational marijuana usually turn out during presidential years like 2012 but stay home during midterms when the electorate skews older and more conservativeIf young people 18 to 29 years

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/25/business/international/when-cannabis-goes-corporate.html,Hershey stopped producing chocolate in Smiths Falls Ontario six years ago The work went to Mexico but the factory remains along with reminders of the glory days A sign that once directed school buses delivering children for tours A fading themeparkstyle entrance that marks what used to be the big attraction  a Chocolate Shoppe that sold about 4 million of broken candy and bulk bars a yearThe once everpresent sweet smell of chocolate is gone too In the highceilinged warehouse where stacks of Hersheys bars and Reeses Peanut Butter Cups once awaited shipment the nose now picks up a different odor the woody herbal aroma of 50000 marijuana plantsClinical climatecontrolled rooms with artificial sunlight house rows upon rows of plants at various stages of growth In the mother room horticulturalists use cuttings to start new plants The flowering rooms are flooded with intense light 12 hours a day to nurture nearly grown plants in strains with vaguely aristocratic names like Argyle Houndstooth and TwillingThe new owner of this factory at 1 Hershey Drive is Tweed Marijuana It is one of about 20 companies officially licensed to grow medical marijuana in CanadaA court ordered the government to make marijuana available for medicinal purposes in 2000 but the first system for doing so created havoc The government sold directly to approved consumers but individuals were also permitted to grow for their own purposes or to turn over their growing to small operations The freeforall approach prompted a flood of complaints from police and local governmentsSo the Canadian government decided to create an extensive heavily regulated system for growing and selling marijuana The new rules allow users with prescriptions to buy only from one of the approved largescale profitseeking producers like Tweed a move intended to shut down the thousands of informal growing operations scattered across the countryThe requirements which went into effect in April are giving rise to what many are betting will be a lucrative new industry of legitimate producers The government which will collect taxes on the sales estimates that the business could generate more than 31 billion Canadian dollars a year in sales within the next decadeIts just so rare that you have an industry thats growing but which has a huge established market said Chuck Rifici Tweeds chief executive A year ago if you asked me if Id be working while looking at thousands of pot plants I would never have thought that would be the case Before deciding to focus on the marijuana business he worked as a financial consultant to technology startup companies in Ottawa less than an hours drive to the northCanada is not unique in transforming onceforbidden cannabis into a legal or at least tolerated proposition The Netherlands has long allowed personal possession and cultivation of small quantities while allowing commercial sales through licensed cafes Spain permits growing for personal use Portugal has decriminalized possession of small quantities of all drugsIn the United States 20 states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana both Washington State and Colorado have legalized recreational use with conditionsBut marijuana remains illegal under federal law creating uncertainty the federal government for example recently banned statelegal marijuana growers from using federal water on their cropsCanadas acrosstheboard law by contrast provides a cohesive set of regulations laying the groundwork for a group of companies to set up operationsThat was really important for us as investors said Brendan Kennedy chief executive of Privateer Holdings a marijuana private equity fund based in Seattle that started Tilray one of Canadas new legal growers People talk about the Colorado model people talk about the Washington model I think someday theyll talk about the Canada model By creating a tightly regulated federal system by creating a federal license by making it difficult to navigate in and capitalintensive Canada has attracted a different kind of player into this industryWhy Not Smiths FallsFor most of its recent history Smiths Falls population 9000 was defined by two things the 19thcentury canal that passes through its center and the chocolatescented air The Hershey plant which had about 800 employees at its peak was a vital part of the economy Until a recent repainting the towns water tower featured the Hersheys logo and declared Smiths Falls the Chocolate Capital of OntarioIt was a huge tourist attraction for the town Dennis W Staples the towns mayor said of the Hersheys factory which lured about 400000 visitors a year They were without a doubt an excellent corporate citizen The company sponsored sports teams and hockey tournaments and helped underwrite a chocolate and railway festival each summerThe relationship seemed so fixed  the factory had been there for more than 40 years  that Mr Staples was a bit puzzled in February 2007 when reporters called asking for comment on Hersheys plan to leave town No one had told Mr Staples Probably not the best way to communicate to the mayor he saidHershey shut down its conveyor belts in 2008 But that was just the beginning of the bad news for Smiths Falls A year later the province of Ontario closed a nearby home for up to 2650 developmentally disabled adults Stanley Tools an industrial company left as did two other American manufacturers And a portion of the Canadian Pacific Railways old transcontinental line for which Smiths Falls was a regional hub was ripped up In all about 1700 jobs vanished according to Mr StaplesAt first Hershey promised to help the town find a new business to take over the plant A flavoredwater company expressed interest but couldnt get the money together In 2012 Hershey sold the plant to a holding company controlled by the Omnicom Group the adagency giant The new owner inquired about demolition permits last summerAround the same time Mr Rifici who lives in Ottawa showed up in Smiths FallsMr Staples and the town council were supportive They believed that Tweed would help stem even if just a little the outflow of jobs and investmentIf its going to happen somewhere in Canada why not Smiths Falls Mr Staples said Its an opportunity to be part of an industry thats sanctioned by the federal government he said Its going to create 100 jobsThe mayor also had a personal reason When his younger brother was dying from colon cancer 11 years ago marijuana was the only way he found relief from his painDespite the warm welcome Tweed has had to overcome the stigma of a onceillicit business Mr Rifici said the factory owner wouldnt lease the plant to a startup focused on marijuana So Mr Rifici and his business partner Bruce Linton had to form a small investment pool to buy the plant for an undisclosed amountEven once in the building Mr Rifici said it was impossible to get a bank loan to buy equipment Initially Tweed raised money from private investors More recently the company has tapped the public markets for 15 million Canadian dollars by issuing stockOther licensed marijuanagrowing operations have faced similar impediments When Privateer decided to start Tilray for example Mr Kennedy crisscrossed Canada to find the right spot It was apparent he said that Privateer would hit resistance in many areas Illegal growing operations had attracted widespread negative publicity for destroying rental houses with mold and creating fire hazards with their lighting systemsIn Nanaimo British Columbia Mr Kennedy found economic development officials who eagerly courted Tilray The city was looking for new businesses to offset a gradual decline of the forestry and fishing industries the regions historical economic base The officials introduced local zoning bylaws that made it easier for the medical marijuana industry to operateTilray has since bought a building for 35 million and spent 17 million to renovate it The company employs 65 people with plans to increase that number to 100 One hundred new jobs in a community of less than 100000 thats a big deal Mr Kennedy saidStill he said it took a while to find a bank that would deal with a marijuana grower The Royal Bank of Canada eventually agreed to take Tilrays account and to process its credit card transactionsNor has Tweed won over everyone in Smiths Falls Like many small bluecollar towns in rural North America it has an illegaldrug problem mainly crack cocaine and marijuanaDarlene Kantor 50 works as a building manager and she says she is thrilled that Tweed came to town with its jobs and millions of dollars of investment But my main concern is Is it going to make the illegal drugs more rampant she saidSome are more skeptical about whether Tweed will be able to provide many jobs They were talking about creating jobs and such and its not going to its not going to do anything said Andrew Brinkworth 18 outside the downtown Tim Hortons A lot of people here have criminal records and theyre not going to be able to get a job at the plant if they have a recordA 300Page ApplicationDressed in a casual shirt and slacks Mr Rifici 39 is built from an entrepreneurial mold His fast speech and seemingly inexhaustible enthusiasm appear to be byproducts of pitching startup ideas to investors or anyone who will listen for two decadesHis early interest in the Internet came from playing simple textbased games Slaying virtual dragons with someone from Australia from my computer in my parents basement in 199192 was eyeopening to how the Internet would fundamentally alter how we lived he said So I had to get involved in some wayIn 1995 during his third year of computer engineering studies at the University of Ottawa he decided to start an Internet service provider He sold the business in 2003 for 11 million Canadian dollars 1 million to a larger competitor Cybersurf where he became chief financial officer Over the next two decades he helped start a dozen tech companiesHis interest in politics indirectly inspired his marijuana business Mr Rifici who volunteers as chief financial officer of the Liberal Party of Canada one of the three main national parties closely tracked the evolution of marijuana lawsIn October 2012 Health Canada the federal agency responsible for drug controls published a long technical list of proposed reforms One thing caught his eye Under the new approach customers could buy only online or through call centers types of systems that his Internet businesses had operatedBut his background didnt prepare him for the regulatory strictures of the medical marijuana business Accustomed to developing startups on the fly with little capital Mr Rifici and Mr Linton another Ottawa entrepreneur who is Tweeds chairman underestimated the money they would need by a factor of three largely because of the governments regulatory demands The application ran 300 pages not including attachments And before they could even submit applications Tweed and other growers had to secure sites for their operations and obtain all local permissions Applicants who passed the initial vetting then had to pass a final twoday inspectionThe requirements are significant Growers must have sophisticated carbon filtration systems to prevent the smell of marijuana from wafting outside They must maintain highsecurity measures like biometric thumbprint readers Employees need to pass rigorous security checks conducted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police which take four to six monthsIf I knew how much regulatory overhead there would be from the beginning I would have probably been just as excited about the industry Mr Rifici said But I might have thought that I might not be able to get thereNothing like a bit of ignorance to allow you to move aheadThe red tape was part of an effort to reform Canadas initial approach to medical marijuana In court filings the government suggested that the old system had become little more than a legal veneer for recreational growers with a significant amount of marijuana making its way to illegal operations Health Canada said users on average grew enough marijuana to roll 54 to 90 cigarettes a day far beyond what they needed for personal useThere was big big diversion going on Brent Zettl the chief executive of Prairie Plant Systems the company that grew and distributed the governmentsupplied marijuana under the old system The company is now among the newly approved growers They ducked behind legitimate patients and used them he saidTrying to Convince DoctorsWalking the vast 425000squarefoot factory Mr Rifici talks animatedly about Tweeds next steps Just behind the new entrance of glass and shiny stainless steel he has carved out space for a gift shop He also hopes to lure a craft brewer into the unused portion of the factory He wants to make 1 Hershey Drive a destination for tourists againTweed is taking a subdued almost artisanal approach to its branding avoiding the CheechandChong vibe of some rivals Many of its marijuana strains are named after fusty fabrics like tweed as well as people and places associated with such clothes The Herringbone strain is supposed to help with depression Bakerstreet is used to treat anxiety Donegal is promoted as a pain relieverBut the industry faces an uphill battle as prominent doctors researchers and even the Canadian Medical Association are advising against prescribing marijuana at all Marijuana they say has not been through the testing and approval process required for other pharmaceuticalsDr MaryAnn Fitzcharles a rheumatologist and professor of medicine at McGill University in Montreal was the lead author of a widely publicized paper recommending that without clinical evidence marijuana should not be prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis About 65 percent of users in Canada under the old system said they suffered from that condition She compares the medical claims for marijuana to those once made for tobaccoI dont think any physician today would say I suggest you take up smoking cigarettes to deal with your anxiety Dr Fitzcharles saidSo Tilray Prairie Plant and Tweed are creating sales teams to persuade doctors to prescribe marijuana Tweeds chief medical adviser Dr John Gillis an emergencyroom and chronicpain doctor in Dartmouth Nova Scotia is working to develop best practices for prescribing marijuana Christopher Murray who worked with a Canadian agency that evaluates new drugs and medical technology leads a medical education and outreach group for TweedA Fine Legal LineWhen Tweed shipped its first two orders directly to customers on May 5 about half of the companys management watched partly for ceremonial reasons but mostly to make sure that its elaborate governmentmandated inventorytracking system worked Employees weighed the total inventory before doling out the shipments onto smaller scales calibrated to 001 gram The marijuana was dropped into boxes bearing Tweeds logo and then to meet government requirements vacuumpacked into odorblocking bags Then came a final check on the scales before the two parcels left in standard courier pouches that did not bear Tweeds nameAs with many in the new industry Tweed repeatedly cites a Health Canada forecast suggesting that the user base will grow to more than 400000 from about 40000 But some analysts wonder how the industry will reach such levels Mr Zettl is one of the few players who acknowledges that many buyers will probably be recreational users with sham prescriptionsLike most people in the medical marijuana trade Mr Rifici rejected suggestions that the industry was ultimately counting on the introduction of an open legalized market But there is such a possibility Justin Trudeau the leader of the Liberal Party has vowed to legalize marijuana if he takes power in elections scheduled for next year and polls suggest that the idea has widespread supportMr Rifici speaking over the drone of dehumidifiers in the production facility said that the difference between medical marijuana and nonmedical marijuana is one of legislationAnd at the end of the day he added our product is essentially highquality marijuana under a medical

retrieved a handgun from a safe and killed his wife while she was on the phone with an emergency dispatcherAs Jack Healy reported in The Times on Sunday Colorado hospital officials are treating growing numbers of children and adults sickened by potent doses of edible marijuana and neighboring states are seeing more stoned driversWe realized there was a problem because were watching everything with the urgency of the first people to regulate in this area said Andrew Freedman the states director of marijuana coordination There are way too many stories of people not understanding how much theyre eating With liquor people understand what theyre getting themselves into But that doesnt exist right now for edibles for new users in the market It would behoove the industry to create a more pleasant experience for peopleThe whole industry was set up for people who smoked frequently It needs to learn how to educate new users in the market We have to create a culture of responsibility around edibles so people know what to expect to feelGov John Hickenlooper and the Legislature recently created a task force to come up with packaging that clearly differentiates pot cookies and candy and gummy bears from normal sweets  with an eye toward protecting children  and directed the Department of Revenue to restrict the amount of edibles that can be sold at one time to one person The governor also signed legislation mandating that there be a stamp on edibles possibly a marijuana leaf Or maybe a stoned skull and bonesThe state plans to start testing to make sure the weed is spread evenly throughout the product The task force is discussing having budtenders give better warnings to customers and moving toward demarcating a singleserving size of 10 milligrams Industry representatives objected to the expense of wrapping bites of candy individuallyMy kids put rocks and batteries in their mouths said Bob Eschino the owner of Incredibles which makes candy and serves up chocolate and strawberry fountains If I put a marijuana leaf on a piece of chocolate theyll still put it in their mouthsHe argues that since pot goodies leave the dispensary in childproof packages it is the parents responsibility to make sure their kids dont get hold of itSomebody suggested we just make everything look like a gray square so it doesnt look appealing Why should the whole industry suffer just because less than 5 percent of people are having problems with the correct dosingDoes he sound a little paranoid,2014-06-04T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/health/politicians-prescriptions-for-marijuana-defy-doctors-and-data.html,New York moved last week to join 22 states in legalizing medical marijuana for patients with a diverse array of debilitating ailments encompassing epilepsy and cancer Crohns disease and Parkinsons Yet there is no rigorous scientific evidence that marijuana effectively treats the symptoms of many of the illnesses for which states have authorized its useInstead experts say lawmakers and the authors of public referendums have acted largely on the basis of animal studies and heartwrenching anecdotes The results have sometimes confounded doctors and researchersThe lists of conditions qualifying patients for marijuana treatment vary considerably from state to state Like most others New Yorks includes cancer HIVAIDS and multiple sclerosis Studies have shown that marijuana can relieve nausea improve appetite and ease painful spasms in those patientsBut New Yorks  list also includes Parkinsons disease Lou Gehrigs disease and epilepsy conditions for which there are no highquality trials indicating marijuana is useful In Illinois more than three dozen conditions qualify for treatment with marijuana including Alzheimers disease lupus Sjogrens syndrome Tourettes syndrome ArnoldChiari malformation and nailpatella syndromeI just dont think the evidence is there for these long lists said Dr Molly Cooke a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco who helped research a position paper on cannabis for the American College of Physicians Its been so hard to study marijuana Policy makers are responding to thin dataEven some advocates of medical marijuana acknowledge that the state laws legalizing it did not result from careful reviews of the medical literatureI wish it were that rational said Mitch Earleywine chairman of the executive board of directors for Norml a national marijuana advocacy group Dr Earleywine said state lawmakers more often ask themselves What disease does the person in a wheelchair in my office haveResearch into marijuanas effects is thin not because of a lack of scientific interest but chiefly because the federal government has long classified it as a Schedule 1 drug with no currently accepted medical use Scientists who want to conduct studies must register with the Drug Enforcement Administration submit an investigational new drug application to the Food and Drug Administration for human trials and win approval from the Department of Health and Human Services or one of the National Institutes of Health The National Institute on Drug Abuse is the only supplier of legal researchgrade marijuanaThe legal and administrative hoops make it hard for investigators to start the randomized placebocontrolled trials that are the gold standard of medical research and the basis for determining which drugs are effective at what doses and in which patientsIts one thing to say we need to have more research and its another thing to obstruct the research said Dr Steven A Jenison former medical director of New Mexicos medical cannabis programThe dearth of data has not prevented legislators and voters across the nation from endorsing marijuana for more than 40 conditions Patients with rheumatoid arthritis for instance qualify for marijuana treatment in at least three statesYet there are no published trials of smoked marijuana in rheumatoid arthritis patients said Dr MaryAnn Fitzcharles a rheumatologist at McGill University who reviewed the evidence of the drugs efficacy in treating rheumatic diseases When we look at herbal cannabis we have zero evidence for efficacy she said Unfortunately this is being driven by regulatory authorities not by sound clinical judgmentNew York considered including the chronic inflammatory disease on its list a development that astonished Dr Mary K Crow an arthritis expert at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan People with rheumatoid arthritis have higher rates of certain respiratory problems she notedInhaling into your lungs is not a great idea with rheumatoid arthritis given the substantial number of patients who have lung disease Dr Crow said The final version of New Yorks law prohibits smoking marijuana and did not end up including rheumatoid arthritisIn Arizona and Rhode Island among other states people with Alzheimers disease may receive medical marijuana to help quell nighttime agitation But Dr Gary Small director of the division of geriatric psychiatry at the University of California Los Angeles said he does not recommend cannabis to Alzheimers patients Agitation and increased confusion are possible side effectsStill he said he would not discourage a caregiver from providing it if it calmed a family member with dementiaParents of children with intractable epilepsy have lobbied hard in several states including New York for inclusion in medical marijuana legislation They want access to an oil called Charlottes Web that is rich in CBD a nonpsychoactive ingredient of marijuana that they say reduces the number of seizuresThis month Gov Rick Scott of Florida a conservative Republican signed a law allowing epilepsy patients access to the oil calling it the best treatment availableScientists have begun randomized placebocontrolled research to determine whether CBD effectively treats severe forms of childhood epilepsy But at the moment highquality research showing that marijuana is a safe or effective treatment for epilepsy does not exist experts sayAs far as data out there there are great animal models and very provoking anecdotes said Dr Orrin Devinsky director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at NYU Langone Medical Center The human data is not there right nowPsoriasis was included in the New York legislation after representatives of Gaia PlantBased Medicine a Colorado company operating dispensaries met with State Senator Diane J Savino and suggested that cannabis lotions helped people with those red raised skin plaques It was dropped from the measure after questions were raised about the lack of supporting evidence  as were other conditions like diabetes and lupusMedical marijuana advocates contend that suffering people should not have to wait for scientific research to catch up to patients needs And why limit marijuana use to only certain conditions they ask when doctors routinely prescribe drugs offlabel for anything they feel likeAmanda Hoffman 35 an information technology specialist in Basking Ridge NJ struggles with ulcerative colitis an inflammatory bowel disease She has tried steroids and Remicade an intravenous infusion but no drug has given her as much relief from frequent daily diarrhea and abdominal pain as her homemade cannabis caramelsOn a recent Sunday Ms Hoffman used a green buttery sludge made with marijuana she bought for 500 an ounce from Garden State Dispensary to make a new batch She is grateful that the state legalized marijuana for patients like her whatever the scientific evidenceCannabis to a lot of people is a punch line but it can also be a lifesaver she saidEven if strong medical research regarding marijuana did exist it is not clear that state lawmakers would be swayedIt would be possible to take case studies or anecdotal information from patients or research done from a university put it in front of a legislator and say We need to include this disease  said State Representative Lou Lang sponsor of the medical marijuana law in IllinoisBut the legislative mind be it in DC or in Springfield Illinois doesnt always go to public policy Mr Lang said The default position is politicsOften state legislators have been motivated not just by constituents in distress but also by the desire to restrict access to limited patient populations so that legal marijuana does not become widely available as a recreational drug in their statesFor example while there is research suggesting that marijuana alleviates certain kinds of chronic pain Mr Lang noted legislators in Illinois were reluctant to legalize its use in such a broad patient population The states list of qualifying conditions is lengthy partly because lawmakers tried instead to specify a number of diagnoses that result in pain some quite rareIll bet there are hundreds of conditions that cause pain and now 30 are listed Karen OKeefe director of state policies at the Marijuana Policy Project said of Illinoiss legislationMedical experts rarely included in these statehouse discussions have often been caught off guard by the sudden passage of laws permitting patients to ask them for marijuanaSince at least 2009 for instance the American Glaucoma Society has said publicly that marijuana is an impractical way to treat glaucoma While it does lower intraocular eye pressure it works only for up to four hours so patients would need to take it even in the middle of the night to achieve consistent reductions in pressure Onceaday eye drops work more predictablyYet glaucoma qualifies for treatment with medical marijuana in more than a dozen states and is included in pending legislation in Ohio and Pennsylvania At one point it appeared in New Yorks legislation tooDr Paul N Orloff the legislative chairman for the New York State Ophthalmological Society reached out to Richard N Gottfried a Manhattan Democrat and sponsor of the Assembly bill and succeeded in getting glaucoma removedIts very illogical to prescribe a medication where its not standardized Dr Orloff said adding None of my 60yearold patients are interested in being stoned to treat their glaucoma,2014-06-27T00:00:00Z,drugs

did a foolish thing in Denver  failing to realize that consuming a single square about a quarter of a pot candy bar was dicey for an edibles virgin  many in the pot industry upbraided me for doing a foolish thingBut some in Mary Jane world have contacted me to say that my dysphoria ie bummer is happening more and more in ColoradoJustin Hartfield is the California founder of Marijuanacom and Weedmapscom a sort of Yelp for pot and an entrepreneur involved in some of the nations top marijuanatechnology companies As The Wall Street Journal noted in a profile last March the 30yearold former high school pot dealer wants to be the Philip Morris of potYour experience points out a significant need for standardized dosing testing and labeling he told me recalling a similar vertiginous paranoia spiral when he and his wife split a pot brownie in Amsterdam in 2008On Friday Marijuanacom launched an ongoing guide to the best practices towards both consumption and sale of edibles It urged every dispensary in Colorado and throughout America to follow Amsterdams lead and put up signs warning about the dangers of oversampling psychotropic treats Other websites from Vice to Vox also weighed in with helpful safety tips on ediblesHartfield said Weedmaps is providing pamphlets posters and video to dispensaries and users including an Edibles Education pamphlet with headings like Start Small Wait because edibles take two hours or longer to take effect Dont Mix with alcohol or other substances and keep Out of Reach of childrenEdibles are not the best delivery device in general for marijuana because its notoriously hard to control the titration in your stomach Hartfield said When you smoke its so easy You have a hit it affects you immediately Then you can decide to take another if you want to get higher With edibles it hits your stomach all at once and holy NellySome Colorado pols are nervous about stories like that of the Longmont mother who found her 2yearold daughter eating a pot cookie in front of their apartment building and the two 10yearolds in Greeley who were caught selling and swapping pot purloined from relatives Not to mention the new British study suggesting there may be a correlation between smoking cannabis and a temporary change in the size and shape of spermIts kind of shocking in a way that the states that approved it have not had more oversight and consumer information said Dr Jerome Groopman of Harvard Medical School who favors legalization The horse is out of the barn so to speak and theres a responsibility to consumers and particularly young people THC is a serious substance It has increased by 5 to 15 times in todays plants compared to the 1960s Its a long time since Upton Sinclair Now consumers have to know Is it pure What is the concentration What are the hazardsOn Wednesday the state task force met to forge a rule denoting 10 milligrams as a serving so that the dosage is clearly demarcated And on Friday Gov John Hickenlooper signed legislation proposing a banking solution for the mainly cash pot business but the Federal Reserve will need to sign off on itBecause the Colorado law was approved by referendum its like a Wild West statute where things are getting filled in underneath with a haphazard application of the regulatory processOne major reason I got involved in the movement was so that consumers could have basic access to information about the products theyre consuming which was totally impossible under the prohibition that created the black market said Tom Angell the founder and chairman of Marijuana Majority So its particularly disappointing to see that some companies in the legal marijuana industry  which our years of advocacy allowed to exist  are falling short of those principles It seems basic labeling and consumer information hasnt been a chief priority but hopefully now its starting to changeHe wants budtenders behind the counter to be trained so they can give customized guidance to customers of varying tolerance levelsAs the black market comes into the light the hangloose community can be uptight about any moves to regulate or put contours around the sale of pot to better protect neophytes teenagers and children Perhaps because they have spent so much time fighting to move past the old Reefer Madness caricature the reefer crowd gets mad at the suggestion of any regulation no matter how small or helpful The clubby community that long existed in the shadows can have a countercultural reaction to rulesAlso as one Colorado political aide pointed out Theres so much money involved This is a group of people who probably never thought about money and now a lot of people just have dollar signs in their eyesLaughing he noted The weirdest thing in the world is to

State are preparing to open next month Cash registers are standing by and the first crops are almost ready for harvesting But not every part of the state is joining the partyThe state attorney general in a nonbinding legal opinion has said local governments can regulate marijuana under the statute legalizing its recreational use and at least 10 cities and counties in Washington have gone even further banning marijuana businesses outright An additional 69 municipalities and 12 counties have voted for moratoriums on such businesses according to the Municipal Research and Services Center a nonprofit group in Seattle that works with local governments on multiple issuesNow a lawsuit brought by a man who was denied a license to sell marijuana in Wenatchee in central Washingtons applegrowing country is challenging the rights of local governments to ban marijuana businesses  and also raising the possibility that the states marijuana law will come under sharp legal scrutinyThe plaintiff Shaun Preder has been told by the city that he will not get a local business license to sell marijuana because the drug remains illegal under federal law  and that all Wenatchee businesses must comply with federal lawMr Preder who runs an office furniture store in Woodinville near Seattle said he spent about 12000 in rent for a 3000 squarefoot shop in Wenatchee that he had hoped to open for marijuana sales But uncertainty about a license has kept him from spending more to get the place readyWenatchees City Council is scheduled to meet on Thursday to decide whether to respond to the suit which was filed in Chelan County Superior Court A resolve to fight  especially if the city takes the position that federal law preempts state law  could ultimately take the suit to the United States Supreme Court where the conflicts between federal and state laws on marijuana have never been addressed legal experts saidWashingtons marijuana law could be affirmed by the courts or struck down And what unfolds in Wenatchee a city of about 33000 that was closely divided from the start about the wisdom of legal marijuana  with a narrow majority in the county supporting it in 2012  could set the stage Backers of legalization say it is a fight they are eager for asserting that the statute will be affirmedWe need clarity said Alison Holcomb the criminal justice director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington State and primary author of the Initiative 502 statuteMs Holcomb said the ACLU would seek to intervene in the case only if Wenatchee specifically claims federal protection for its position The federal preemption issue hasnt been resolved she saidBut a will to fight is not the only consideration Wenatchees mayor Frank Kuntz who does not have a vote on the sevenmember City Council has said the city cannot afford hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal billsMr Kuntz urged the Council last fall to drop the word federal from the licensing code and to grant the marijuana licenses that might be pending but the Council affirmed the language instead by a 4to3 voteMr Preders lawyer Hilary Bricken said that no matter what the Council decides on Thursday

places where the local authorities are not trying to bar the door She said she would seek an emergency court order holding the citys ban in abeyance if the suit goes forwardAnother legal expert who studies marijuana law said that uncertainty at least for now is the only certainty  in Washington and any other state considering legalizationAs long as marijuana remains illegal under federal law you will have a certain amount of grayness in the system said Douglas A Berman a law professor at Ohio State University and editor of the online legal forum Marijuana Law Policy and ReformProfessor Berman said the strains of a system without uniformity  legal under one legal code illegal under another  echo the cracks that emerged near the end of alcohol prohibition when some states in the 1920s began to back off enforcement of the Volstead Act banning alcohol even as federal enforcement continuedIn marijuana regulation and enforcement he added Unintended legal consequences are inevitable because

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/opinion/mandatory-sentencing-for-medical-marijuana.html,How did the United States land of the free become the worlds top jailer Its a question asked by visitors from other democracies and the American citizen who wakes from a stupor to find that our prisons are stuffed with people serving interminable sentences for nonviolent crimesFor the answer you need look no further than the real America the sparsely settled ruggedly beautiful financially struggling eastern third of Washington State There 70yearold Larry Harvey his wife two family members and a friend are facing mandatory 10year prison terms for growing medical marijuana  openly and they thought legally  on their farm near the little town of Kettle FallsTo get a sense of the tragic absurdity of this federal prosecution reaching all the way to the desk of Attorney General Eric H Holder Jr consider what will happen next month Pot stores will open in Washington selling legal marijuana for the recreational user  per a vote of the people A few weeks later the Feds will try to put away the socalled Kettle Falls Five for growing weed on their land to ease their medical maladies Federal sentencing guidelines which trump state law call for mandatory prison termsHarvey is a former longhaul truck driver with a bad knee spasms of gout and high blood pressure He says he has no criminal record and spends much of his time in a wheelchair His wife Rhonda FirestackHarvey is a retired hairdresser with arthritis and osteoporosis Mr Harvey says he takes his wifes homebaked marijuana confections when the pain in his knee starts to flare The Harveys thought they were in the clear growing 68 marijuana plants on their acreage in northeast Washington one of 22 states allowing legal medical marijuana Federal authorities say they are several plants over the limitTheir pot garden was a coop among the four family members and one friend the marijuana was not for sale or distribution Mr Harvey says I think these patients were legitimate Dr Greg Carter who reviewed medical records after the arrest told The SpokesmanReview of Spokane They are pretty normal people Were not talking about thugsBut the authorities using all the military tools at their disposal in the exhausted drug war treated them as bigtime narco threats First a helicopter spotted the garden from the air Brilliant except Harvey himself had painted a huge medical marijuana sign on a plywood board so that his garden in fact could be identified as a medical pot plot from the airThis was followed by two raids One from eight agents in Kevlar vests The other from Drug Enforcement Agency officers They searched the house confiscating guns and a little cash in a drawer The guns are no surprise Finding someone who does not own a firearm in the Selkirk Mountain country is like finding a Seattleite who doesnt recycle Still the guns were enough to add additional federal charges to an indictment that the family was growing more than the legal limit of plantsNow lets step back The Harveys live in the congressional district of Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers who is part of the House Republican leadership She loves freedom You know she loves freedom because she always says so most recently in a press release touting her efforts to take away peoples health care coverage Americans must be protected from out of control government she statedWell maybe Unless that government is trying to take away the freedom of a retired couple growing pot to ease their bodily pains That freedom is not so good Astonishingly in our current toxic political atmosphere Republicans and Democrats joined together last month to vote by 219 to 189 to block spending for federal prosecution of medical marijuana in states that allow itYaayyy for freedom There was one dissent from Washington States delegation Yes Cathy McMorris Rodgers standing firm for an out of control government instead of defending one of her freedomloving constituentsLets go further up the government ranks As a candidate Barack Obama promised to immediately review these sentences  mandatory minimums  to see how we can be smarter on crime and reduce the ineffective warehousing of nonviolent drug offendersHe kept that promise in ordering a review And his Justice Department also issued new guidelines saying the Feds would try to avoid prosecution of medical marijuana operations so long as they dont do things like funnel money to interstate drug operations or sell to children The Harveys say they meet the guidelinesWhy the federal prosecution then Attorney General Holder was in Spokane last week meeting with his subordinates But he said nothing about the case Trial is set for July 28 and the Harveys cant use legal medical marijuana as a defense a judge has ruled All the government has to prove is that the Harvey family was growing marijuana  a federal crimeIf they go to prison for a decade as the mindless statutes that grew out of the crackcocaine scare stipulate they would become part of a federal system where fully half of all inmates are behind bars for drug offenses And one in four of those crimes involves marijuanaSo remember the Kettle Falls Five when all the legal pot stores and their already legal growing facilities open for business in Washington State next month There will be silly features about cookies and candy bars laced with pot and discussions about etiquette dos and donts The press will cite polls showing that a majority of Americans favor legalizing marijuana and more than 80 percent feel that way about medical cannabis But in the eyes of the federal government these state laws are meaninglessIf Larry Harvey at the age of 70 with his gout and high blood pressure and bum knee gets the mandatory 10year term hes likely to die in prison certainly not the last casualty of the assault on our citizens known as the War on Drugs For him freedom is just another word his congresswoman likes to throw around on the Fourth of July,2014-06-27T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/us/after-5-months-of-sales-colorado-sees-the-downside-of-a-legal-high.html,DENVER  Five months after Colorado became the first state to allow recreational marijuana sales the battle over legalization is still ragingLaw enforcement officers in Colorado and neighboring states emergency room doctors and legalization opponents increasingly are highlighting a series of recent problems as cautionary lessons for other states flirting with loosening marijuana lawsThere is the Denver man who hours after buying a package of marijuanainfused Karma Kandy from one of Colorados new recreational marijuana shops began raving about the end of the world and then pulled a handgun from the family safe and killed his wife the authorities say Some hospital officials say they are treating growing numbers of children and adults sickened by potent doses of edible marijuana Sheriffs in neighboring states complain about stoned drivers streaming out of Colorado and through their townsI think by any measure the experience of Colorado has not been a good one unless youre in the marijuana business said Kevin A Sabet executive director of Smart Approaches to Marijuana which opposes legalization Weve seen lives damaged Weve seen deaths directly attributed to marijuana legalization Weve seen marijuana slipping through Colorados borders Weve seen marijuana getting into the hands of kidsDespite such anecdotes there is scant hard data Because of the lag in reporting many health statistics it may take years to know legal marijuanas effect  if any  on teenage drug use school expulsions or the number of fatal car crashesIt was only in January for example that the Colorado State Patrol began tracking the number of people pulled over for driving while stoned Since then marijuanaimpaired drivers have made up about 125 percent of all citations for driving under the influence of drugs or alcoholProponents of legalization argue that the critics are cherrypicking anecdotes to tarnish a young industry that has been flourishing under intense scrutinyThe vast majority of the states medical and recreational marijuana stores are living up to stringent state rules they say The stores have sold marijuana to hundreds of thousands of customers without incident The industry has generated 126 million in taxes and fees so far though the revenues have not matched some early projectionsMarijuana supporters note that violent crimes in Denver  where the bulk of Colorados pot retailers are  are down so far this year The number of robberies from January through April fell by 48 percent from the same time in 2013 and assaults were down by 37 percent Over all crime in Denver is down by about 10 percent though it is impossible to say whether changes to marijuana laws played any role in that declineEvery major institution said this would be horrible and lead to violence and blood in the streets said Brian Vicente one of the authors of Amendment 64 which legalized marijuana in Colorado None of thats happened The sky did not fallThe argument is being waged with fervor because both sides say Colorados successes and failures with regulating marijuana will shape perceptions of legalization for voters considering similar measures in other states and for leery federal law enforcement officials After the 2012 legalization votes in Colorado and Washington State  where recreational sales are expected to begin this summer  Justice Department officials gave the states a cautious green light But they warned that they might intervene if marijuana ended up fueling violence or drug trafficking or flowing across state lines or into the hands of childrenMarijuana opponents like Thomas J Gorman of the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program which helps law enforcement say Colorado is already falling short of those standardsIn any other state if they were making as much money and growing as much dope theyd be taken out by the feds Mr Gorman saidFew agree on how much legally purchased marijuana is being secreted out of Colorado Michele Leonhart the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration told a Senate panel in April that officials in Kansas had tallied a 61 percent increase in seizures of marijuana that could be traced to Colorado But according to the Kansas Highway Patrol total marijuana seizures fell to 1090 pounds from 2790 pounds during the first four months of the year a 61 percent declineSome sheriffs and police chiefs along Colorados borders say they have noticed little change But in Colby Kan which sits along an interstate highway running west to Colorado Police Chief Ron Alexander said charges for sale distribution or possession related to marijuana were rising fast This year he tallied 20 such cases through May 23 Two years ago there were six during that same time periodSheriff Adam Hayward of Deuel County Neb said he was locking up more people for marijuanarelated offenses Its kind of a freeforall he said The state or the federal government needs to step up and do somethingCriminal marijuana cases in Colorado plunged by 65 percent in 2013 the first full year of legalization for personal recreational use but the police in some areas have been writing dozens of tickets to crack down on public marijuana smokers Police and fire officials across the state have been contending with a sharp rise in home explosions as people use flammable butane to make hashish oil And despite a galaxy of legal regulated marijuana stores across the state prosecutors say a dangerous illicit market persistsIn February for example in the Denver suburb of Aurora a 17yearold planning to rob an outofstate marijuana buyer instead accidentally shot and killed his girlfriend law enforcement officials saidWhy break into a house to steal a TV or a computer that you have to fence when you can steal mounds of cash or marijuana which is like liquid said George Brauchler the district attorney who oversees Aurora Thats the kind of stuff were starting to become more aware ofMany of Colorados starkest problems with legal marijuana stem from potinfused cookies chocolates and other surprisingly potent edible treats that are especially popular with tourists and casual marijuana usersOn Colorados northern plains for example a fourth grader showed up on the playground one day in April and sold some of his grandmothers marijuana to three classmates The next day one of those students returned the favor by bringing in a marijuana edible he had swiped from his own grandmotherThis was kind of an unintended consequence of Colorados new law said John Gates the districts director of school safety and security For crying out loud secure your weed If you can legally possess it thats fine But it has no place in an elementary schoolSo far this year nine children have ended up at Childrens Hospital Colorado in Aurora after consuming marijuana six of whom got critically sick In all of 2013 the hospital treated only eight such casesIn March the state logged what appeared to be its first death directly tied to legal recreational marijuana when a 19yearold African exchange student Levy Thamba Pongi plunged to his death in Denver He and three other students had driven from their college in Wyoming to sample Colorados newly legal wares Mr Pongi ate marijuanainfused cookies began acting wildly and leapt from a hotel balcony officials said the medical examiners office said marijuana intoxication had made a significant contribution to the accidentIn April the shooting death of Kristine Kirk raised even more concerns about regulating edible marijuana Minutes before she was killed Ms Kirk called 911 to say her husband Richard was talking like it was the end of the world and had consumed marijuana and possibly prescription medication for back pain according to a police affidavit Police later confirmed that Mr Kirk had bought the Karma Kandy and a prerolled joint from a licensed marijuana shop that eveningThose two deaths combined with reports of groggy nauseated children visiting emergency rooms forced the state to tighten its labeling and packaging rules for edible marijuana Regulators are also considering whether to set lower limits on the amount of THC the psychoactive component of marijuana that can be packed into one cookie or chocolate bonbonEven supporters of legalization such as Mr Vicente say Colorado needs to pass stricter rules about edible marijuana He said the state was racing up a sharp learning curveMarijuana was illegal for 80 years Mr Vicente said Now its legal and everyones just trying to figure out how to approach these new issues,2014-06-01T00:00:00Z,drugs

some groups formed numerous corporations to apply myriad times  significantly boosting their lottery odds and prompting complaints they gamed the systemOthers say they were kicked out of the lottery because inaccurate measurements placed them within 1000 feet of a protected area because board staff misread their criminal history or because they supposedly failed to turn in complete applicationsSimmons says anyone who believes mistakes were made in their removal from the lottery should appeal and 127 people have done so But its unclear what the state will do for them if they

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/upshot/state-initiatives-from-the-important-to-the-ho-hum.html,Next Tuesday American voters will face a lot of important questions Should marijuana be legal Should legalized gambling be expanded And should Montanas state auditor who does not audit the state instead be called the Commissioner of Securities and InsuranceVoters will decide 147 statewide questions in all ranging from the profound to the mundane Here are a few key themes to watch for on election nightMinimum wage The federal minimum wage is 725 per hour Four states Alaska Arkansas Nebraska and South Dakota will consider proposals to raise it to levels ranging from 8 to 975 Illinois will vote on a nonbinding advisory question about whether the minimum wage should be 10 Michigan voters however will not vote on a minimumwage increase because lawmakers there enacted one in May under pressure from groups collecting signatures to pass a larger increase by initiativeDrugs and alcohol Colorado and Washington legalized recreational marijuana by ballot initiative in 2012 this year Alaska the District of Columbia and Oregon will consider doing the same Florida will vote on legalizing marijuana for medical use Arkansas will consider a proposal to legalize alcohol sales statewide currently about half the states counties are dryGambling Eight states will vote on proposals to expand legal gambling In two the question is whether legislatively approved expansions should be ratified in Massachusetts voters will decide whether to go ahead with three casinos that the legislature authorized while Californians will consider rejecting a state law that authorizes the North Fork band of Mono Indians to open a casino in the Central Valley on a site 36 miles away from the actual tribal settlement Another tribe that operates a nearby casino has led the opposition to offreservation gamblingColorado Rhode Island and South Dakota will decide whether to legalize more kinds of gambling games at existing facilities For example blackjack is currently legal in Deadwood SD but craps and roulette are not Kansas South Carolina and Tennessee will vote on allowing raffles or lotteries as nonprofit fundraising vehiclesHunting Alabama and Mississippi voters will decide whether to establish a constitutional right to hunt Maine voters will decide whether to ban bearbaiting and using dogs to hunt bears And the only statewide ballot questions in Michigan are two nearly identical proposals to reject state laws authorizing wolf hunting  but it doesnt really matter how people vote on them since the states legislature enacted a new law to ensure that its authorization of a wolf hunt would stand even if voters reject the other two lawsTransportation funding Several states are considering how much money to dedicate to transportation Texas will vote on a constitutional amendment to divert certain oil and gas extraction taxes to shore up its transportation fund Maryland and Wisconsin may amend their constitutions to prevent legislators from raiding transportation funds to pay for other parts of government Massachusetts legislators have indexed the states gasoline tax to inflation so that transportation revenues would keep up with inflation voters are now being asked to repeal indexationVoting Montana will decide whether to abolish sameday voter registration Missouri will consider amending its constitution to allow early voting but only during business hours on six weekdays before the election Earlyvoting advocates had hoped for a more expansive early voting periodBaitandswitch questions Arkansass Issue 3 is titled The Arkansas Elected Officials Ethics Transparency and Financial Reform Amendment of 2014 Its most important effect however would be to lengthen term limits in the states legislature from a maximum of 8 years to 16Californias Proposition 46 is called Drug and Alcohol Testing of Doctors Medical Negligence Lawsuits Proponents advertisements have focused on the aspect of the law that would require doctors to submit to random drug and alcohol tests But the core of the dispute over Prop 46 is whether the cap on pain and suffering damages in medical negligence lawsuits should be raised to 11 million from 250000 As Adam Nagourney reported for The Times in AugustBaseactivating measures Illinois voters will consider three questions on hotbutton issues for the left raising the minimum wage requiring prescription drug plans to cover contraception and imposing a tax on millionaires to fund education However all three questions are purely advisory and will have no force of law Republicans in Illinois have criticized the questions as using the referendum process to drive turnout rather than for lawmakingOf course using referendums for base activation isnt a strategy unique to the left Republicans sought to put proposals against samesex marriage on ballots in 2004 in part to increase turnout among social conservatives And this year there are some largely symbolic questions coming from the right including those righttohunt measures in the South and a state constitutional amendment to ban the use of Sharia law in Alabama a similar proposal adopted by Oklahoma voters in 2010 was thrown out by federal courtsAre we really voting on this In general state constitutions can be amended only by popular vote and the overinclusiveness of those constitutions can lead to voters being asked to weigh in on some very mundane questionsFor example New York voters will decide whether to allow the state legislature to distribute proposed legislation to its members electronically Currently a paper copy of every proposed bill must be placed on every members desk three days before voting leading to the use of 19 million sheets of paper in every twoyear session The paperbills requirement is in the constitution so the legislature cant stop the printing without voters permissionWyoming voters will decide whether nonresidents of the state may sit on the University of Wyoming board of trustees Again yes thats a matter in the state constitution that the legislature couldnt change without voter approvalAnd then theres the issue of the Montana state auditor Despite her title the state auditors job is regulating the securities and insurance industries State Auditor Monica Lindeen thinks that confuses the public and shes already started using the title Commissioner of Securities and Insurance Making that change official requires amending the constitution which legislators voted to do last year now voter approval is requiredBut this is not the first time Montanans have weighed in on what the auditor should be called In 2006 when the legislature put a question on the ballot asking whether to rename the office as Insurance Commissioner 64 percent of voters rejected the proposal Perhaps this time will be different,2014-10-31T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/13/world/americas/ap-cb-jamaica-rasta-rights.html,KINGSTON Jamaica   Taking a deep draw on a pipe that glows with burning marijuana reggae luminary Bunny Wailer gives a satisfied grin through a haze of aromatic smoke in his concrete yard painted in the red green gold and black colors identified with his Rastafarian faithThese days the baritone singer from the legendary Wailers the group he formed in 1963 with late superstars Bob Marley and Peter Tosh has reason to feel good  There is unprecedented traction building in Jamaica to decriminalize pot meaning the dreadlocked Wailer and other adherents of Rastafari  a homegrown spiritual movement that considers the drug divine  may soon be able to smoke without fear of arrestRastas have treated marijuana as something legal all along even though we have been sent to prison for using the herb in our prayer But this is the time for all these pressures to stop The world is catching up now the 67yearold threetime Grammy winner said at his modest Kingston homeJamaica is known internationally for its marijuana The hardy plant grows easily on the tropical Caribbean island where its use is culturally entrenched despite being legally banned for 100 years Cultivation is kept hidden with small patches tucked into mountainsides in swamps and between rows of other crops Wailer himself was convicted of possession in 1967 and did more than a year of hard laborPrevious moves to decriminalize the drug failed to advance mainly because officials feared they would violate international treaties and bring sanctions from Washington But now with a number of US states relaxing their marijuana laws  Colorado and Washington even allow recreational use  Jamaica is rethinking its positionJustice Minister Mark Golding says Jamaicas Cabinet has approved a plan to decriminalize marijuana including for religious purposes and legislators are expected to authorize it before the end of the yearFreedom to use marijuana for religious worship is one of various amendments to Jamaicas Dangerous Drugs Act supported by Prime Minister Portia Simpson Millers administration Her ministers also have proposed unclogging courts by decriminalizing small amounts of weed for personal use making possession of 2 ounces or less a ticketable offense The main hope is that a regulated medical marijuana and scientific research sector could help draw investments to the cashstrapped island which is laboring under its latest loan program with the International Monetary FundGanja as marijuana is known locally has a long history on the island It was introduced to Jamaica in the 19th century by Indian indentured servants and it gained popularity as a medicinal herb Use spread among the poor in the 1930s with the founding of Rastafari a spiritual movement that melds Old Testament teachings and PanAfricanism and whose followers worship the late Ethiopian Emperor Haile SelassieRasta adherents say use of the holy herb induces a meditative state that brings them closer to the divine The faithful smoke it as a sacrament in chalice pipes or cigarettes called spliffs add it to vegetarian stews and place it in fires as a burnt offeringFor years Rastafarians were treated as secondclass citizens and looked down upon by many Jamaicans as oddball even dangerous drugaddled cultists Police shooting ranges once had images of dreadlocked Rastas as targets The spiritual movement attracts only a small percentage of the countrys mostly Christian population of 27 millionIt wasnt until the 1970s when the Wailers and other Rasta musicians popularized the Rastafarian culture among betteroff Jamaicans that marijuanas popularity began to filter through the islands rigid class structure and gain a wider acceptance Marleys worldwide popularity has made him Jamaicas most famous and revered sonWhile Rastafari followers tend to disdain government initiatives for many Jamaicas decriminalization plans signal a crucial victory after decades of struggleThe momentum building presents a major step forward for the recognition of the religious rights and expression of Rastafari said Anta Anthony Merritt a Rastafarian priest who is a faculty member at San Diego State UniversityEven if the current proposals fall short of the full legalization Rastas long have sought they are welcomed by many said Priest Dermot Fagan leader of a small sect in an isolated commune in the Blue Mountains that tower over KingstonWe are thankful for the coming changes and yes some of the pressures will be eased But we cant forget the destruction the mayhem that has been caused by the persecution of this divine herb said Fagan waving his hands for emphasis on a balcony overlooking the School of Vision retreat a place where Rasta mysticism brushes against the realities of modern lifeResearchers who study the movement are curious about how decriminalization for Rastafari will play out For now there are a lot of unanswered questions Ennis Edmonds an associate professor of religious studies at Ohios Kenyon College whose publications focus on Rastafari said determining what is religious use in Jamaica will not be easy Theres essentially no formal church organized conversion process and few places of communal gathering An individual Rastas personal relationship with Jah or God is considered central to the faithMost ritual smoking does not take place in official places of worship but in peoples yards and on street corners Can a single Rasta smoking a spliff in any location claim religious use privileges Edmonds askedBut for Wailer the time is clearly ripe for change in Babylon the unflattering Rasta term for the Western worldRastas have gone through a lot of hassles for years getting criminalized and locked up for using the herb But things are changing because ganja is what the world needs now Wailer said before taking another appreciative toke from his

the current ban on marijuana inflictinggreat harm on society just to prohibit a substance far less dangerous than alcoholThe reactions on Twitter were robustThe New York Times is right the war on

marijuana legalization wasnt already a major political issue its about to get much bigger httptcoNfaoibx3ZD Rebecca Berg rebeccagberg 26 Jul 14The Times is the largest newspaper in the United States to come out in support of pot legalization  though not the first The Seattle Times published an editorial in February 2011 urging the Washington State Legislature to lift a state ban on the drug Marijuana should be legalized regulated and taxed The push to repeal federal prohibition should come from the states and it should begin with the state of Washington Initiative 502  a statewide measure legalizing marijuana use  passed in November 2012Colorado also passed a legalization ballot initiative that year and although an editorial in The Denver Postsaid that possession and use of marijuana should be legal Amendment 64 a state constitutional amendment was considered an inappropriate route If the federal government continues to resist concessions to growing sentiment in the favor of a truce in the war on marijuana the editorial said individual states may have to defy Washington in the same way many have with medical marijuana But were not prepared to welcome such a step by Colorado now or the clash that would ensue between the federal government and this state For that matter if Colorado becomes an island with legal marijuana whats to prevent it from also becoming a magnet nationally for marijuana users and distributorsLast year after leaders in the District of Columbia endorsed aplan to make smalltime marijuana possessiona civil rather than criminal offenseThe Washington Post which has not always been amenable to legalization efforts published an editorial supporting a similar plan to slap smalltime users with a civil fine which is a measured way to send a message that the government does not condone or tolerate marijuana useAttitudes about marijuana are changing and quickly The Post conceded Of all the official reactions to changing mores on marijuana decriminalization is the bestOther major newspapers to have endorsed decriminalization of marijuana at the federal or state level or bothinclude The StarLedger New Jersey The Las Vegas ReviewJournal The Indianapolis Star The Orange County RegisterandThe Baltimore SunOthers remain hesitant if not outright opposedThe editors of The Oregonian for example were concerned about Initiative 502 Washington voters have changed the question Oregonians will answer in November when they cast their ballots for or against legalization To a significant degree the question of availability has been settled Credit  or blame  rests with both Oregonians who approved a wideopen medical marijuana system and Washingtonians who will now be peddling pot legally to thousands of OregoniansOregon will vote on legalization this November and The Oregonian advises marijuana opponents who resent being maneuvered into an uncomfortable position by Washington voters to think of Novembers vote as an opportunity to fight backThe fact that legal pot has growing momentum doesnt mean its a good idea a 2012 editorial in USA Todaysaid Modern marijuana can be very powerful potent enough to make it dangerous to drive or operate other machinery under the influence Backers of legal pot wisely advocate tough penalties for driving while stoned but do we really want to add another widely available drug to roads where alcohol already causes mayhem And do we want to worry more than we already do that pilots or train engineers or others are high when they come to work That would be more likely if pot were legalIn an editorial published earlier this year The Wall Street Journal was similarly skeptical Marijuana politics are changing especially in California the West and New England but the consequences of legalization are unknowable in advance Perhaps the gains will be everything the stoners claim though bonginspired visions tend to be defeated by realityOther major newspapers to express antilegalization views even in medical cases include The Los Angeles Timesin 2010 The Arizona Republic2013 The Deseret News2012 The Oklahoman2014 and The Christian Science

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/27/us/ap-fbn-browns-gordon-suspended.html,CLEVELAND   Josh Gordons wait is over and so is his 2014 season Now the star wide receivers career is in perilThe Browns learned Wednesday that Gordons indefinite suspension by the NFL has been upheld and he will miss at least 16 games for another violation of the leagues substance abuse policy A repeat drug offender Gordon had appealed the penalty hoping it would be reduced so he could play this seasonThe NFL though came down hard on Gordon who must now pay the price for stepping out of boundsThe league announced that arbitrator Harold Henderson supported Gordons yearlong suspension for marijuana use The Pro Bowler who was subject to more frequent testing will begin serving his suspension immediately and the league said in its statement that his eligibility for reinstatement will be determined following the 2014 seasonIn the meantime Gordon is not allowed to practice with the team attend meetings or other club functionsBrowns general manager Ray Farmer expressed some disappointment at the decision but said the team has no choice but to move ahead without GordonWhile we may have strong feelings on the timing and the process of this decision we have also consistently communicated that we will focus on what we can control in our day to day approach Farmer said in a statement Right now that is preparing our team for the 2014 season and at the same time supporting Josh however we are able under NFL guidelines during his suspensionThe Browns had feared for months this would be the outcome and now that its official the club will have to somehow make up for the leagueleading 1646 yards 189 yards per catch and nine touchdowns Gordon produced last seasonId like to apologize to my teammates coaches the Cleveland Browns organization and our fans Gordon said in a statement I am very disappointed that the NFL and its hearing office didnt exercise better discretion and judgment in my case I would like to sincerely thank the people who have been incredibly supportive of me during this challenging time including my family my agent my union my legal team and the Cleveland Browns staffWhile hes out Gordon who served a twogame suspension for a drug violation last season will need to pass drug tests comply with treatment and apply for reinstatement with Commissioner Roger Goodell before he plays again Gordon could possibly return inside a year if he stays cleanGordon met with league officials in New York on Aug 4 to appeal his suspension As the days past there was growing speculation he might not be punished to the letter of the collective bargaining agreement But Henderson sided with the leagues initial ruling after an exhaustive processThe Browns have known Gordon could be banished for some time and theyve been eager for a resolution to his case which hung over their training camp He continued to practice and played in Clevelands first three exhibition gamesGordon fought the suspension by hiring attorney Maurice Suh to represent him at the appeal hearing Suh who had successfully gotten a suspension reduced for Seattle cornerback Richard Sherman argued that Gordon tested positive for marijuana due to secondhand smoke Gordons representatives also said test results of his samples were inconsistent and should be thrown outThere was speculation the league might go softer on Gordon following the public outcry after Baltimore running back Ray Rice was suspended for two games on a domestic violence charge Instead the league put Gordon on the sideline for all 16 games and will wait to see how he behaves before deciding whether to let him backGordon didnt help his cause with two legal issues as his case dragged on He was charged with drunken driving after his arrest in Raleigh North Carolina on July 5 In May he was stopped for speeding in Strongsville Ohio and one of the passengers in his car was cited for marijuana possessionThe talented 23yearold led the league with 1646 yards receiving last season despite being banned from the first two games for a failed drug test  It was his second known violation as a pro and Gordon said he had inadvertently taken codeine contained in a prescription cough syrupGordons loss is a crippling blow to Clevelands offense depriving the Browns of their best bigplay threat Pro Bowl tight end Jordan Cameron is now the teams primary target and he may find himself doubleteamed and without open spaces to run routes now that Gordon is missingThe Browns took a risk in selecting Gordon in the 2012 supplemental draft forfeiting a secondround pick to take the speedy 6foot3 225pounder who failed at least three drug tests in college for marijuana abuseThe team has vowed to do all it can to help and support Gordon During training camp owner Jimmy Haslam said the team never considered cutting himAs he awaited word from the league Gordon was noticeably different He dropped passes and seemed detached during an exhibition game in Washington Recently he posted a photo on Instagram of himself on the practice field catching a pass from rookie quarterback Johnny Manziel Gordon captioned the photo Only place I can find peaceIts been taken awayGordons on his own___OnlineAP NFL website wwwpro32aporg and wwwtwittercomAP_NFL,2014-08-27T13:11:55Z,drugs

and legalized marijuana But the closing days of its tight governors race are coming down to an oldfashioned issue crimeRepublican gubernatorial candidate Bob Beauprez is slamming Gov John Hickenloopers record on public safety hoping a debate over crime and punishment will help him knock off a Democratic incumbent whos overseen an improving state economyBeauprez and GOP allies have criticized Hickenlooper for state prison and parole policies for a law making it harder to charge juveniles as adults and for Colorado Democrats failure to pass tougher penalties for repeat DUI offendersAnd two starkly personal issues continue to command attention in the races closing days Hickenloopers indefinite stay of execution for multiplemurderer Nathan Dunlap and the slaying of Tom Clements the governors prisons chief Clements was killed at his doorstep last year by a former inmate released after spending much of his sentence in solitary confinementWith Colorado voters already casting ballots Beauprezs campaign last week unveiled what essentially is part of its closing argument  a television ad summing up Republicans public safety indictment of Hickenlooper The ad cites reporting from The Denver Post that found prisoners who completed their terms were released even though they threatened to commit violenceIn its original form the ad referenced the case of Evan Ebel who authorities say was responsible for the deaths of Clements and Nathan Leon who was working a second job delivering pizzas to support his familyThe ad closes with the line With John Hickenlooper as governor  is your family safeBeauprezs strategy of painting Hickenlooper as soft on crime is not without riskIt strikes me as a contrived and manufactured issue and voters  have an intuitive sense about what fears are real and what fears are manufactured said Colorado independent political analyst Eric SondermannAfter the ad launched it got an immediate rebuke from Clements widowLisa Clements accused Beauprez of attempting to use our familys tragic loss for your personal and political gain and asked him to stop Beauprez quickly removed the reference to ClementsIts very disappointing to see the death of a public servant and friend used to try and score political points Hickenlooper campaign spokesman Eddie Stern saidHe also noted Hickenlooper has no legal authority to prevent a prisoner from being released from prison after serving their courtordered sentenceClements death exposed several problems in the department including whether parolees were being monitored properly and whether correction officials were overusing solitary confinement  a question Clements was working to addressBeauprez said he didnt mean to offend Clements widow but hes remained steadfast in his latest round of criticism of Hickenloopers administrationThe reference to Clements death was replaced with the mention of a policy to grant deathrow inmates four hours of leisure time The governors office says the policy has been mischaracterized saying it was a staffsafety measure aimed at lessening interaction between prison employees and deathrow inmatesI think we need leadership that is willing to recognize that evil does exist Beauprez said last week flanked by two prosecutors and GOP lawmakers at a news conference Beauprez planned another rally based on publicsafety Thursday with US Republican Senate hopeful Cory Gardner and New Jersey Gov Chris ChristieWe need a governor that starts to care about public safety said Jefferson County District Attorney Pete Weir a Republican who served as the public safety director for former Democratic Gov Bill Ritter The last four years I can say without hesitation or equivocation have been the most offenderfriendly years in my entire careerHickenloopers administration said Republicans are using hyperboleThats partisan nonsense and the kind of thing you hear in an election year but you dont hear in the regular course of business said Alan Salazar one of Hickenloopers top advisersThe bill making it harder to charge juveniles as adults had GOP support And legislation in recent years to reduce penalties for drugpossession offenses had bipartisan backingThis year Hickenlooper also signed a Republicansponsored bill that would make parolees subject to immediate warrantless arrest if they tamper with their electronic monitoring deviceEbel had removed his anklemonitoring bracelet but it was days before authorities found outHowever a bill to remove earned time for inmates who misbehave failed in the Democratcontrolled Senate after passing with bipartisan support in the HouseEbel received 115 days of earned time  which could not be revoked  even though he was cited 28 times for offenses that included fighting and assault during his nearly eight years in prisonHickenloopers campaign said the governor would like to see the issue addressed again next year He also supports tougher DUI penalties but his party has expressed concern about the implementation costs___,2014-10-29T14:54:19Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/us/politics/surveys-of-voters-signal-dismay-with-both-parties.html,Politically divided Americans were in dour agreement about much as they voted in this years midterm elections  broadly distrustful of government overwhelmingly disapproving of Congress convinced that the nations economic system favors the wealthy and doubtful that the next generation will inherit a better economic futureRepublicans went into the contest heavily favored to make significant gains typically the presidents party is on the defensive in midterm elections and most of this years battles for Senate seats were in conservative states But voters surveyed after casting their ballots both at the polls on Tuesday and by phone for those who voted early signaled deep dismay with both parties and were at least as negative about Republican congressional leaders as about President ObamaMr Obama was at the center of the campaign debate if not on the ballot as Republicans sought to exploit his unpopularity by tying Democratic candidates to him especially in the fight for control of the Senate A majority of voters said they disapproved of how the president was doing his job and about eight in 10 of those who disapproved supported RepublicansAs bleak as Democrats prospects were the party succeeded to some degree in its strategy of focusing on female voters especially minorities and single women by attacking Republicans for their legislative actions to limit access to abortion and birth controlDemocrats won a majority of women a traditionally supportive group but one that sided with Republicans by a single percentage point in 2010 the previous midterm election year That setback four years ago was a big factor in enabling Republicans to win control of the House and of many state legislatures and governorshipsOn Tuesday single women supported Democrats over Republicans by more than 20 points In Senate battlegrounds like Colorado Georgia Iowa and North Carolina Democratic candidates also won a majority of women But it was not enough to avert losses given the overwhelming support male voters provided for the RepublicansYet political independents  a group that six years ago helped propel Mr Obama to the presidency  once again supported Republicans though by a smaller margin than in 2010 Democrats also failed again in other ways to rebuild Mr Obamas broad coalition of 2008 losing among middleaged voters suburbanites and Catholics though not as badly as in 2010Democrats did hold onto groups that form their base union households gays blacks Hispanics Asians younger voters lowerincome Americans political moderates Northeasterners city dwellers Jewish voters and both those without high school educations and those with graduate degreesThe surveys of voters showed that Republicans also won their core supporters whites men older voters Southerners white Protestants veterans higherincome people weekly churchgoers white evangelical Christians and rural residents Edison Research conducted the surveys for a consortium of news media organizationsAs was true in polls throughout the year the economy was the top issue on most voters minds Nearly half selected this issue as their top concern  nearly double the number that picked health care the next most pressing issue Fewer than one in five voters named foreign policy or immigration as their primary concernDespite a range of good economic news of late including a declining unemployment rate many voters are not believersMore than threequarters said they were worried about where the economy is headed in the next year a majority of those supported Republicans Voters split evenly on whether the economy is getting better worsening or staying the same those who see it getting better backed Democrats by a threetoone margin while those who foresee conditions getting worse similarly supported RepublicansBut perhaps the most telling sign of Americans downbeat state of mind was the measure of their confidence  or lack of it  in the American dream About half the voters said they expect that the next generation will not enjoy a better life than Americans today That was a significant increase from 2010 The pessimistic voters backed Republicans two to one while the half of Americans who believe the next generation will enjoy the same or better lives voted by a similar margin for DemocratsOver all more than half of voters expressed negative feelings toward both the Democratic and Republican parties In a cautionary note for Republicans about reading too much into their victories onequarter of the voters who supported the partys candidates did so despite harboring bad feelings about the party Among voters who backed Democrats a significantly smaller share was negative toward that partyVoters stances on a number of issues emphasized the stark differences between Democrats and Republicans and suggested why it has been years since many Americans claimed they saw no difference between the partiesVoters closely split on whether samesex marriage or marijuana should be legal for example with those in favor overwhelmingly supporting Democrats and those opposed supporting Republicans by similar marginsOn several issues majorities expressed views in sync with Democrats A slim majority said abortion should remain legal supporters favored Democrats and opponents Republicans A larger majority agreed that climate change is a serious problem and those who did overwhelmingly supported Democrats while those who disagreed backed Republicans And most voters favored allowing immigrants here illegally to have a chance to seek legal status  a position at odds with Republican opposition that hardened in the course of the years campaignsVoters remain evenly divided over Mr Obamas signature Affordable Care Act which Republicans sought for a third election cycle to make an albatross around Democrats necks On that issue too voters who support the law or say it should have gone farther overwhelmingly went for Democrats while opponents chose Republicans,2014-11-05T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/01/world/americas/ap-lt-uruguay-pot-plan-in-peril.html,MONTEVIDEO Uruguay   Uruguays plan to create the worlds first national governmentregulated marketplace for legal pot may be going up in smokeDelays in implementing the plan are putting it at risk as polls point to opposition gains in Octobers election and say most Uruguayans oppose a legal pot marketplace Opposition politicians have said they will seek to repeal or modify the legislation which gives the national government power to oversee the production sales and consumption of marijuanaI am convinced that the current project is never going to be applied the principal opposition presidential candidate Luis Lacalle Pou told The Associated Press The entire project is not workable The pharmacies dont want to sell the drug and nobody is going to register as a user as the law obligesThe legislation which went into effect in May allows for the growing of pot by licensed individuals the formation of growers and users clubs the sale by pharmacies of 40 grams of pot a month to registered users and the tracking of legally grown marijuana through a system of genetic markers of authorized plantsPresident Jose Mujica and his Broad Front movement have promoted the plan as a way to deal with rising homicide and crime rates associated with drug trafficking and the increasing use of crack cocaine In the last 13 years the homicide rate in Uruguay has increased by 21 percent and the rate of violent robbery by 250 percent Officials say a legal pot market could provide an alternative to crack and reduce the power of drug gangsThe appearance of drug trafficking signified a brutal cultural change in the world of crime and a nearly absolute disregard for the value of life Mujica told the AP in May So we decided to try to snatch away a part of that marketIt wasnt until Friday almost three months after the pot law went into effect that the government made its first call for applications from those interested in growing pot for the legal market It said after registration closes Aug 18 bidders will be winnowed to a short list of candidates from which up to five will be chosen to get a license for legal cultivationOfficials have given conflicting dates for when the drug might reach pharmacies ranging from late this year to sometime in 2015Experts say the delays are due to the fact that no other country has attempted such a plan and that authorities still lack detailed plans and rules for creating the market Disagreements within the government over basic aspects of the proposal are also holding things backOpposition Colorado Party presidential candidate Pedro Bordaberry said The entire project is one big improvisationThe man in charge of the program Julio Calzada has dismissed concerns insisting the bids to select growers will be a success and the project will go forwardWhile Mujicas marijuana plan was widely applauded globally and seen as going beyond marijuana legislation in the US states of Colorado and Washington most Uruguayans oppose it The most recent poll said only 27 percent of Uruguayans surveyed approve of the law and 64 percent oppose it Sixtytwo percent said they want the law repealed The survey by the polling firm Cifra questioned 1001 people between July 4 and 15 and had an error margin of three percentage pointsPeople are against drugs and dont distinguish between them said Adriana Raga director of Cifra For a small educated sector  very small  marijuana is something special But for the great majority of Uruguayans all drugs are bad and marijuana is another bad drug the same as base cocaine pasteWith elections nearing politicians are paying heed to public opinion The top opposition candidates are supporting repeal or modification of the lawPolls indicate a tight race in October congressional and presidential elections between the Broad Front and the opposition None of the seven presidential candidates appears capable of getting enough votes to win outright in the first round That would set up a runoff on the last Sunday in November between the two top votegettersFor the law to be out of peril the Broad Front has to win both the presidency and a majority in congress which it currently barely controlsThe data that we now have does not show this is happening said Raga of Cifra There are still three months of campaigning to go but as of today it is not our hypothesisUruguays main polling companies say around 40 percent of Uruguayans intend to vote for the leftist governing coalition

were thwarting the democratic willIf Republican leaders are unwilling to keep up the fight the issue could lose much of its potency on the right And conservative activists will see it as one more reason to feel alienatedPerhaps the biggest question is how the issue will factor in the 2016 presidential race None of the prospective presidential candidates including Mr Walker favor broadly extending marriage rights to gay and lesbian couples Doing so would almost certainly be politically fatal in the primaries but could help in the general electionSo there was Senator Ted Cruz of Texas

at the forefront of efforts to reclaim it as a mainstream cropResearchers and farmers are producing the first legal hemp crop in generations in Kentucky where hemp has turned into a political cause decades after it was banned by the federal government Republican US Sens Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul advocate for it as does state Agriculture Commissioner James Comer a Republican who is running for governor next yearThe comeback is strictly small scale Experimental hemp plots more closely resemble the size of large family gardensStatewide plantings totaled about 15 acres from the Appalachian foothills in eastern Kentucky to the broad stretches of farmland in the far west said Adam Watson the Kentucky Agriculture Departments hemp program coordinatorThe crops reintroduction was delayed in the spring when imported hemp seeds were detained by US customs officials The states Agriculture Department sued the federal government but dropped the case Friday after reaching an agreement on importing the seeds into Kentucky The seeds were released after federal drug officials approved a permitSince then test plots have shown the crop to be hardy and fast growing  and a potential moneymaker with a remarkable range of traditional uses including clothing mulch hemp milk cooking oil soap and lotionsWhat weve learned is it will grow well in Kentucky Comer said It yields a lot per acre All the things that we predictedAt Murray State University about 180 miles southwest of Louisville plants have sprouted to at least 8 feet tall turning a shade of green and yellow as they reach maturity Harvest is approachingIts had a good growth period said Murray State agriculture dean Tony L Brannon It appeared to tolerate the extremes in weather from extremely wet to extremely dry pretty wellHemps roots in Kentucky date back to pioneer days and the towering stalks were once a staple at many farmsWeve got an excellent climate for it excellent soils for it Watson said Its a good fit for Kentucky producers The ultimate question is going to come down to economics Is there a market and can Kentucky capture thatGrowing hemp without a federal permit was banned in 1970 due to its classification as a controlled substance related to marijuana Hemp and marijuana are the same species Cannabis sativa but hemp has a negligible amount of THC the psychoactive compound that gives marijuana users a highLegal production of the crop has been gone for so long that it was a virtual blank slate in modern Kentucky agricultureTeams of researchers and farmers are studying which seed varieties and soil types are best suited and how much moisture or fertilizer are neededThere are a lot of unknowns Watson said Its those sorts of answers that producers are going to need before they can turn it into an economically viable crop on their farmsFor now growing hemp is strictly limited The federal farm bill enacted this year restricts hemp production to research projects designated by agriculture departments in states that allow the crop to be grown But commercial uses are also emergingFifteen states have removed barriers to hemp production according to Vote Hemp a group that advocates for the plants legal cultivationLicensed growers were able to secure seeds in three states  Kentucky Colorado and Vermont  the group said but  difficulties in obtaining seeds limited production  According to Eric Steenstra president of Vote Hemp the biggest obstacle was gaining approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration to import hemp seeds for plantingIn Vermont about 12 farms registered to grow hemp said Alison Kosakowski a spokeswoman for the states Agency of Agriculture Food and Markets The agency doesnt know how many producers ended up planting a hemp cropThe intentions were much bigger in Colorado There were 56 registrations for commercial hemp production and 76 more for research and development according to Ron Carleton the states deputy agriculture commissionerUnavailability of seed likely kept a fairly significant number of applicants from getting hemp in the ground he said Some farmers able to produce a crop this year may harvest the seeds to grow next years crop he saidIn Kentucky the crop is being studied by researchers at a halfdozen universitiesEastern Kentucky University researchers recently harvested their small hemp plot Those plants reached 7 feet tallIt seems to be fairly easy to grow said EKU agriculture professor Bruce Pratt The plants got established so quickly that they shaded out the weedsA 2013 report by the Congressional Research Service pegged hemp imports at 115 million in 2011 a tiny sum relative to other imported cropsIf widespread US production is someday allowed states able to attract processors close to where the crop is grown will be the winners said University of Kentucky agricultural economist Will SnellIts a small niche market but its growing he said We can grow it The problem is other

but have been meeting with clergy community leaders and students in hopes of building relationships that could ease tensions on the streetsI know theres a lot of anxiety theres a lot of fear anticipation about that announcement said Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt Ron Johnson who was put in charge of security in Ferguson in the days after Brown was killed and is now part of a coordinated command with local police But I have a lot of hopeLaw enforcement officers expect to receive at least a days notice before a grand jury announcement That should provide time for them to execute security plans but may also allow demonstrators to prepareThe moment I learn that there is in fact a nonindictment then theres going to be an organized protest said Eric Vickers a black St Louis attorney and civil rights activistBrown was unarmed when Wilson encountered him walking in the street with a friend A scuffle ensued and Brown was shot multiple times Witness accounts of what happened varied with some people saying they saw Brown raise his hands as if in surrenderWilson told investigators he felt threatened while fighting with Brown from inside a police SUV where an initial gunshot was fired according to information provided to several news outlets by people described as familiar with the investigation but not otherwise identified After Brown fled the vehicle Wilson said Brown turned around in a threatening manner prompting the officer to fire the fatal shots according to those accounts of his testimonyWilsons description of events was leaked recently as was an autopsy report that showed Brown had marijuana in his system and was shot in the hand at close range Wilson has alleged Brown was trying to grab his gun in the SUVIt appears that it may be calculated to soften the blow if there is no indictment said Peter Joy a law professor at Washington University in St Louis who directs the schools Criminal Justice ClinicBut he said its conceivable that if the leaks are from law enforcement that perhaps there may be an indictment and this is calculated to garner public sympathy for officer WilsonWilsons attorneys have denied being the source of the reportsThe shooting stoked longsimmering racial tensions in Ferguson a predominantly black community with an overwhelmingly white police force Protests have continued for two months in the St Louis area often peaceful but sometimes devolving into clashes between police firing tear gas and demonstrators lobbing rocks and bottlesLaw enforcement agencies have declined to say whether they will proactively line the streets with more officers as the grand jury announcement is made or position them in strategic locations to react as neededSt Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said hes learned it works better to let sergeants and lieutenants retain their normal place in the chain of command instead of supplanting them with higherranking officersWeve also learned we have to have a dialogue with our demonstrators so they know what to expect from us and we know what to expect from them Belmar saidAmnesty International on Thursday released a report documenting what it described as human rights abuses by police during the protests following Browns death The report accuses police of violating citizens rights by intimidating protesters using riot gear aiming highpowered weapons at people using tear gas firing rubber bullets and flashbangs and setting curfewsPolice are attempting to better document events and handle widespread arrests more efficiently To ensure the state Highway Patrol is at full strength it is limiting trooper vacations around the time of a potential decision and local police may be put on longer shiftsAfter the initial clashes with protesters the state Highway Patrol purchased more shields and equipment for its officers St Louis city police recently spent 325000 upgrading helmets sticks and other civil disobedience equipment said Police Chief Sam DotsonMore than 350 St Louis officers now have been trained in civil disobedience tactics St Louis County police and state troopers also have undergone training focused largely on ensuring they understand protesters constitutional rightsBelmar Johnson and other law officers have been meeting frequently with clergy students and community leaders Pastors in turn have been preaching messages of nonviolenceEarlier this week Democratic state Sen Jamilah Nasheed of St Louis intentionally got arrested for refusing to leave the street in front of the Ferguson Police Department Even that was an

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/13/arts/in-pay-any-price-james-risen-examines-the-war-on-terror.html,In Pay Any Price Greed Power and Endless War James Risen a Pulitzer Prizewinning investigative reporter for The New York Times sets out to portray the many seamy sides of the war on terror during the past 13 yearsThose willing to overlook his occasionally lumpy prose will be rewarded with a memorable chronicle of the longrange consequences of the panicky reaction of top American officials to the Sept 11 attacks from lost billions in taxpayer dollars to the lost life of a former torturer and the smashed dreams of an intelligence whistleblowerWe are plunged into an unsettled noirish world in which scam artists and thieves swarm government agencies peddling phony software and other novel tools for the war against terror The Bush administration was throwing money at the terrorist problem and plenty of people were willing to catch a few bundles Mr Risen begins by following about 2 billion from the United States to Baghdad which was then stolen with much of it ending up in a bunker in Lebanon in what may be one of the largest robberies in modern historyIn this world it is often unclear who is the handler and who is the stooge Dennis Montgomery was just another overweight gambler in the casinos of Reno Nev until he claimed to have developed a technology that could decode secret messages embedded in the videotapes of Osama bin Laden that were broadcast on the Al Jazeera news network On the basis of that claim he won millions of dollars in government contracts Mr Risen says that around Christmas of 2003 Mr Montgomery influenced the Bush administration to seriously consider shooting down civilian airliners After French government investigators concluded that Mr Montgomerys operation was a hoax Mr Risen reports the CIA quietly dropped him Mr Montgomery then moved on to the United States Special Operations Command which paid his company 96 million for a facial recognition technology that supposedly could identify terrorists observed by cameras attached to drones Mr Montgomerys company eventually collapsed in a welter of debts and legal claimsMr Risen also delves into the human wreckage left behind by the war on terror portraying the hellish postArmy life of Damien M Corsetti a soldier who by Mr Risens account engaged in torture at the Abu Ghraib prison west of Baghdad He illustrates what the United States Army should have known before going into Iraq that torture has two victims the one who suffers it and the one who inflicts it Mr Corsetti is shown living in Savannah Ga having kicked an addiction to heroin but living in a cloud of marijuana smoke with posttraumatic stress disorder He is one of the first veterans known to have been given full disability based on PTSD suffered while conducting harsh interrogations in the war on terror Mr Risen writesThe best section of the book is probably the last about the trespasses against the United States Constitution committed by the National Security Agency Here Mr Risens style becomes clearer and his narrative surer The tale of Diane Roark who worked on the staff of the House Intelligence Committee is both hairraising and representative of the postSept 11 era in which accountability and transparency in government basic elements of a functioning democracy were badly eroded When she realized that the NSA was collecting data on American citizens she tried to find out more and then to warn people She assumed that she had stumbled across a rogue operation She asked members of Congress about it and got nowhere She then contacted a federal judge who oversaw intelligence matters only to have the judge report her to the Justice Department She went to officials she knew at the CIA and the White HouseMs Roark eventually realized that all these people had known about the NSA program and effectively approved of it She retired from her Congressional job and moved to Oregon only to wake up one morning in July 2007 to find FBI agents with a search warrant and a sealed affidavit that allowed them to go through her house apparently to look for evidence that she leaked data about the NSA to newspaper reporters Mr Risen notes that others who discussed their concerns about the NSAs constitutional transgressions received similarly harsh handling one reason that Edward J Snowden fled overseas when he leaked documents about United States intelligence agencies surveillance of American citizensTo follow Mr Risen on this journey the reader must hack through some undergrowth For example is it really necessary to write twice that crazy became the new normal in the war on terrorMr Risen also sometimes overreaches He states flatly that Every general in the military hoped to cash out by going to work for a major defense contractor as soon as he or she retired from active duty This is true of too many retired generals and admirals but hardly all Large numbers go into nonprofit work or academia For example off the top of my head I know of a Marine general who joined a drug addiction rehabilitation charity and an Army lieutenant general who just finished a doctoral dissertation at Johns Hopkins University on just war theory in ancient Greek philosophyMr Risen also discloses the ethically questionable move of misrepresenting himself in an effort to interview two people involved in a front company established for the Special Operations Command I did not identify myself as a journalist or author instead I simply told them I was an investor interested in what they were doing This was a firing offense at the last newspaper where I worked I am assured by an editor at The Times that this did not occur in the course of reporting for the newspaperStill his core message resonates We have scared the hell out of ourselves he quotes an expert on terrorism as saying That conclusion is a fitting epitaph for the first decade of the current century Mr Risen certainly makes the case in this book that America has lost much in its lashing out against terrorism and that Congress and the people need to wake up and ask more questions about the political financial moral and cultural costs of that campaign,2014-10-13T00:00:00Z,drugs

featured in publications that rarely cover classical music including High TimesNow the city of Denver is asking the orchestra to call off the events arguing that they would run afoul of laws prohibiting the public consumption of marijuana The symphony which planned the fundraisers as private events in an effort to comply with the law is mulling whether it can go ahead with the first one scheduled for May 23With the fundraiser concerts now in legal limbo the time seems ripe to consider some of the artistic possibilities of cannabisfriendly classical concerts Before the city raised its objections to the Colorado Symphonys plans The New York Times asked several prominent conductors composers and musicians what they would program to appeal to concertgoers taking advantage of Colorados recent referendum legalizing the recreational use of marijuanaAlan Gilbert the music director of the New York Philharmonic suggested Berliozs Symphonie Fantastique which musically depicts an opium dream in parts and The Poem of Ecstasy by the Russian composer Scriabin who became fascinated by mysticism late in his life Does Scriabins Poem of Ecstasy really need an explanation he asked in an emailScriabin was also one of the choices suggested by Jeremy Denk the pianist and author who will be the music director of next months Ojai Music Festival in CaliforniaMessiaen Scriabin  things where the composer claims certain chords have certain colors and that have rapturous endless clouds of notes were Mr Denks suggestions in an email In that same vein but perhaps a bit more austere he said he would recommend late works by Liszt and pieces by CharlesValentin Alkan a virtuosic 19thcentury French pianist and composer and Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji a 20thcentury English pianist and

musiciansCannabis will NOT be sold at any Classically Cannabis event the orchestra notes at its website adding that guests would be encouraged to find alternatives to driving with discounts for car services available The symphonys regular concert venues and programming it adds would remain cannabisfreeIn a letter objecting to the proposed fundraisers the citys Department of Excise and Licenses wrote that it was advising that you cancel the effort to use your business to provide an event for the public consumption of marijuana in violation of local and state laws It warned that failure to follow the law may result in civil and criminal penaltiesThe letter also cautioned that the cannabisthemed events could endanger the symphonys contract with the city for the use of Boettcher Concert

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/nyregion/in-brooklyn-proposing-to-end-prosecutions-for-low-level-marijuana-offenses.html,The Brooklyn district attorneys office will stop prosecuting people arrested on charges of possessing small amounts of marijuana according to a confidential policy proposal that the district attorney Kenneth P Thompson sent to the New York Police Department this monthThe policy is part of a broader push on the part of Mr Thompson who took office this year to look at alternatives to court for lowlevel offenders His office is also participating in a task force looking into placing 16 and 17yearolds who commit lowlevel nonviolent misdemeanors like scrawling graffiti or aggressively riding bicycles on sidewalks into a short behavioral program rather than the court systemDefense advocates and community groups across the nation have been pushing the judicial system to rethink the traditional approach to handling small offensesYet the moves have created tension between Mr Thompson and police officials The police commissioner William J Bratton has been a proponent of the broken windows theory of policing which holds that arrests for small violations help prevent larger crimes Mr Bratton espoused this theory when he was the commissioner under Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani in the 1990s and after returning to the department this year has been directing officers to go after subway panhandlers and peddlersNow the Police Department may have to grapple with how to handle those accused of criminal marijuana possession when under the proposed policy prosecution will not followAccording to the memorandum when the police bring a lowlevel marijuana case and the defendant has no criminal record or a minimal criminal record there will be a presumption that such case will be immediately dismissed and the police will be directed to destroy the defendants fingerprintsOn Wednesday Mr Bratton said that he would not respond to something that I have not basically reviewed in great depth or had discussions with the district attorney about but added that the department would continue to make marijuana arrests even as it used a lot more discretion in doing soHe said he opposed the decriminalization of marijuana but pledged to continue to work with the political leadership and to work with the various prosecutors offices on how to deal with that issueMr Thompsons push is rare among prosecutors The Manhattan district attorney Cyrus R Vance Jr publicly supports alternatives to incarceration and endorsed a plan advocated by Gov Andrew M Cuomo to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana but has not gone so far as to propose his office stop prosecuting such casesA spokeswoman for Mr Thompson said in a statement that he was moving forward on a whole range of smartoncrime strategiesOne goal of the proposed marijuana policy still in draft form is to ensure that individuals and especially young people of color do not become unfairly burdened and stigmatized by involvement in the criminal justice system for engaging in nonviolent conduct that poses no threat of harm to persons or property according to the memo a copy of which was obtained by The New York TimesMarijuana possession is the most common reason for arraignment in New York City Criminal possession of marijuana in the fifth degree which is the charge when someone is caught with small amounts of marijuana in public view has repeatedly been the top arraignment charge in the city according to court recordsProcessing such cases  there were over 8500 of them in Brooklyn in 2013  requires a significant amount of paperwork staff and logistics the document says and more than twothirds of the cases end up being dismissedWe are pouring money and effort into an endeavor that produces no public safety benefit for the community the memo readsAccording to civil liberties researchers there is a huge gap between how black and white people are treated in marijuana cases In Brooklyn and Manhattan black people are nine times as likely to be arrested for possessing marijuana than white people  the highest disparities in the state according to a 2013 report from the New York Civil Liberties UnionDefense advocates say the charge of possessing marijuana in public became a particular problem with the rise in stopandfrisk police tactics where their clients were told to empty their pockets and then brought in on misdemeanor chargesThe consequences of even minor charges can be broad said Lisa Schreibersdorf executive director of Brooklyn Defender Services And even if a charge is dismissed people spend up to 24 hours in jail alongside others who have often committed more serious crimes she said Any policy that can move all of these issues in a positive direction is a good policy she saidThe Brooklyn borough president Eric L Adams said he supported the proposalOne of the tragedies that took place over these last few years is many of the D As should have done more to redflag many of these arrests Mr Adams said We cant continue to tie up our court systems with these petty marijuana arrestsAs Mr Thompsons policy on marijuana offenses goes forward he is also examining how to handle other petty crimesA task force that includes the district attorneys office the Police Department Brooklyn Defender Services and the Legal Aid Society has been studying how to divert 16 and 17yearolds from the criminal justice systemThe group has been conducting a pilot program called DATY run by the nonprofit group Young New Yorkers and aimed at young people who receive desk appearance tickets that charge nonviolent offenses Rather than sending the youths through the court system the program has them attend artsbased sessions that promote critical thinking about good choices  for example having the attendees sketch out what the effect on their families would be if they were arrested They graduate at court in front of Judge George A Grasso who oversees arraignments in New York Citys criminal courts Court records are then sealed and immediately dismissedThe task force is looking into expanding the program to all 16 and 17yearolds given desk

to expand the living wage law today a move he promised to make months ago The law covers thousands of previously exempt employers and raises the hourly wage itself Whos affected Living wage laws set a higher minimum wage for employers that receive government subsidies The expansion affects employees of commercial tenants on projects receiving more than 1 million from the city including retailers fastfood restaurants and construction contractors  How many The current living wage law reaches only about 1200 workers the administration estimates the expanded law will benefit an estimated 18000 over the next five years How much The hourly wage goes from 1030 to 1150 for workers who receive benefits Workers who dont get benefits receive 1313 up from 1190  Why Its part of the de Blasio administrations goal to tackle inequality If the mayor can successfully match the minimum wage to the living wage all hourly workers in the city will earn more than 15 by 2019 according to projections  Why now Mr de Blasio promised to expand the living wage by February but failed to follow through drawing criticismHe later explained that his administration initially planned only to expand the law

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/26/us/ap-car-nascar-tony-stewart-.html,HUNTERSVILLE NC   For Tony Stewart there was no greater joy than escaping his everyday life and climbing behind the wheel of a sprint car He loves the feel the way they drive the purity he finds at all the tiny dirt tracks across the countryWhen he broke his leg racing his sprint car a year ago an injury that sidelined him for six months he was almost defiant in his desire to never give up his hobby But after the death of Kevin Ward Jr who was killed when Stewarts car struck him as Ward walked on an upstate New York dirt track on Aug 9 Stewart may never get back in a sprint carI would say its going to be a long time before you ever see me in a sprint car again if ever I dont have any desire at this moment to get back in a car Stewart told The Associated Press in his first interview since a grand jury decided he would not be charged in Wards deathIf I had the option to go right now to a race I wouldnt I dont even know when Ill go to a sprint car race again to watch I can promise you its going to be a long time before you ever see me back in oneSitting on his couch Thursday night in his Huntersville North Carolina home a sprint car race in Arkansas was on mute on his television Stewarts eyes were constantly drawn to the action He cant help himself Its where he came from how he made his name and the one form of racing he simply couldnt walk away from even as he was criticized for jeopardizing his lucrative NASCAR career by messing around in the dirtHe just couldnt give it up Not when he became a multimillionaire and one of NASCARs biggest names not after good friend Jason Leffler was killed in a sprint car race last year and not after his own injury led to three surgeries a month in bed and forced him to miss NASCAR races for the first time in his careerStewart is addicted to the simplicity of sprint car racing to racing at venues across the country where the crowd is starving for gimmickfree racing He didnt care that a field full of drivers of varying ages and talent were racing for purses that rarely reach 5000He made it his goal to give back to the sprint car community at every turn especially after his accident He improved the part that broke and caused his broken leg and spent 110000 on firesuits and helmets for nearly 50 drivers who needed updated safety equipmentStewart even paid for the embroidery on the firesuits His only request That his Tony Stewart Racing logo be placed in a position that would not be noticed during interviewsStewart has been grappling with the decision to leave sprint racing since his 2013 crash at an Iowa dirt track Hed only returned to sprint car racing one month before Wards deathIts hurt for 16 months to sit and be scrutinized for it said Stewart and to try to give back to a sport that you love and every time you turn around youve got to constantly defend yourself for doing something and trying to support something that you believe in and care aboutChuck Miller race director and President of the Empire Super Sprints series that Stewart and Ward were racing in that night understands how Stewart feels but believes it would be a blow to sprint car racing if he never returnedI do hope that somewhere down the line hell reconsider Miller told AP There arent many drivers of his stature that have done what hes been able to do for all of motorsports and especially sprint car racing Hes been able to win races at all levels of the sport including almost every sprint sanctioningStewart a threetime NASCAR champion spent three weeks in seclusion at his Indiana home after Wards death and describes those weeks as the darkest of his lifeOn the advice of legal counsel Stewart would not describe what he remembers about the crash at Canandaigua Motorsports Park but insists what happened was 100 percent an accidentWard and Stewart had been racing for position when Ward crashed exited his vehicle and walked down the dark track in an apparent attempt to confront Stewart A toxicology report found Ward also had marijuana in his systemWards family has said the matter is not at rest and Stewart may still face a civil lawsuit Stewart wants to discuss the accident and said not being able to talk about what happened keeps me from moving forward It just stays there hanging over my headIts just been a really tough six weeks I went to go have fun for a night and thats not what ended up happeningWard and Stewart didnt know each other and Stewart doesnt recall them ever talking He laments that in the scrutiny that followed  some questioned if Stewart had tried to intimidate Ward for stepping on the track  that the loss of the 20yearold driver and his promising career fell to the background He said he cant imagine how the Ward family is feeling doesnt blame them for anything they may say about him but hopes to someday get the chance to sit with them and talk about that nightI would hope they understand  maybe they do maybe they dont maybe they never will  that I do care he said Ive tried to be respectful of their process of grieving and not push myself on them Im sure they have things that they want to know what happened and I think its important for them at some point to hear it from my pointStewart believes his past  previous eruptions have included him throwing a helmet at another car shouting and shoving matches and sharply worded dressing downs  has played heavily into how the public has viewed Wards death But he doesnt believe he has a problem with anger and did not have a problem with Ward that eveningAnger had nothing to do with what happened that night Stewart said I wasnt angry with anything or anybodyHe is back at NASCAR events after missing three racesBut when not at the track he barely leaves his house A day feels like a month His mind wanders his emotions get the best of himAt stake now is a streak of a winning at least one race every year of his Sprint Cup career and Stewart has just eight more chances this season to get to Victory Lane Its a mark he can focus on to help his healing and he insists his heart and his head are up to the challengeIf it doesnt happen it doesnt happen Theres going to be a lot bigger things at the end of my life that are going to matter more than my Cup career he said But youve got to have goals youve got to have something to push for youve got to have a reason we do thisIts nice to have something to focus on again,2014-09-26T04:04:44Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/fashion/a-drug-mule-for-the-medicare-set.html,My mother has many attributes but athleticism has never been one of them She always hesitates before stepping onto an escalator and rarely walks beyond our circular driveway So when her physician ordered her onto a treadmill last winter it hardly seemed surprising that her heartbeat jumped dramatically even when the pace was not brisk She is 80 after allTo temper her tempo she was soon prescribed a very expensive heart medication I have to take it or I might have a stroke she told me a problem for me as her future caregiver as well as for her Luckily Medicare and her supplemental insurance picked up most of the cost so a 90day prescriptions worth of pills came to just 135  a good rate to pay I thought for a good heart rate But in July her discount suddenly endedYour mother is in the doughnut hole my 83yearold father said to me grimly I had no idea what he was talking about but knew from his expression it was not a good place to be I instantly pictured my mom encased in a giant inner tube of fried flour uselessly trying to eat her way out like a doomed character in Willy Wonkas Chocolate FactoryI quickly learned that the doughnut hole has nothing to do with baked goods and is instead the term used to describe the gap my mother had now reached in her Medicare Part D prescription drug program She had hit her initial coverage limit of close to 3000 a year calculated by adding together the full fee of all her drugs and now would have to pay a higher outofpocket cost for her prescription drugs until she reached the catastrophic coverage threshold thousands of dollars laterGiven that she also takes other medications her drug costs were suddenly going to go through the roof  and as I share that roof with my parents husband brother and children it was also going to skyrocket our mutually managed budget Her heart medication alone would now cost more than 800 for a threemonth supply Now it was my heart that was starting to palpitate But it turned out that my parents had a planCall it The Dallas Buyers Club of Seniors but a number of their octogenarian friends are now ordering their prescription drugs through pharmacies in Canada Living in Michigan as we do the border is an easy maplesyrupouting awayHaving spent a portion of my youth wondering where I could score pot for myself and my friends I now found myself spending latenight hours on the Internet looking for Canadian medications for my mother I quickly learned that her biggestticket item the one for her ticker would cost just 335 for a 90day supply if I bought it a mere 47 miles from our hometownSuddenly Canada seemed like one giant Costco to meAs luck would have it I was about to go to Ontario to visit some close friends The timing could not have been more lucky I just had to learn the rules of the geriatric game before my timeIm wondering if you can help me out I asked in a polite voice a few days later as I slipped a guy at a Toronto pharmacy a folded piece of paper containing copies of my mothers prescriptionsThe pharmacist looked me over closely We get a lot of Americans like you doing just this he said making me feel like the medication mule I had now becomeIs it legal I asked him quietly mumbling into the collar of my jean jacketNo he said explaining that the Food and Drug Administration cannot allow foreign drugs to be resold or distributed in the United States I wondered if I should make a run for the door before he called in the feds But then he explained how it really worksCustoms looks the other way when it comes to personal use he saidAs I soon learned by checking the FDA website the United States government has issued guidelines on bringing prescription drugs over the border As the pharmacist explained my mother could not sell the drugs and could obtain only a 90day supply of medication she had already been prescribed by a doctor licensed in the United States More important a Canadian doctor had to sign off on her personal doctors prescriptionI left the pharmacy wondering if I could pick up a doctor in a bar nearby and get him on the phone with my mother for a quick consultation But given that it was 10 am and I am married that did not seem like the best idea or one my parents would applaud even if I did return with a stash of pillsTwo days later I was visiting another friend on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls and he happened to mention a doctor friend who lived nearby Knowing my parents  as my friend has for many years  I quickly pulled him aside slipping my drug list into his front pocketCan you get me these I said explaining the situation PleaseWithin a halfhour he was off trying to track down his doctor But alas the doctor had gone on a golfing weekend as doctors do in August In the end I left the country emptyhanded with nothing but a sixpack of Molson to declare at CustomsThe good news is that we have now found a Canadian physician my mother has met with him who works with a reliable Canadian pharmacy that will ship the doughnuthole drugs to our doorstepThe bad news is I now realize how many elderly people

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/15/world/americas/a-vaquita-is-ensnared-by-criminals-and-nets.html,SAN FELIPE Mexico   It is a rare moment when scientists can point to an animal at the edge of extinction and predict when it might disappear forever But it is happening here under the golden waters of the desertrimmed sea where a small porpoise has almost vanishedNobody imagined that the end would approach so quickly What changed was the appearance of a new threat to the snubnosed porpoise known as the vaquita organized crimeThe vaquita a shy marine mammal is simply collateral damage as poachers here sweep up another endangered species a giant fish called the totoaba to please consumers in China The vaquitas become entangled and die in the nets set for totoabaLike the Chinese demand for other rare animal parts including shark fins the market for totoaba is driven by customers who pay generously in this case for the totoabas swim bladder Dried and served in soup it is believed to have medicinal qualitiesWith each kilogram of swim bladder fetching as much as 10000 here its sale is more lucrative than that of marijuanaThe effect of the totoaba poaching on the vaquita came as a shock to conservationists A study released in July concluded that half of the population which inhabits the northern reaches of the Gulf of California had been killed in two years leaving just 97 vaquitasThe numbers prompted a group of Mexican and international vaquita experts to issue a dramatic warning Without drastic steps to save the worlds smallest marine mammal the group said it would disappear within four yearsIts definitely the last call for this species said Barbara Taylor a marine mammal expert who is part of the scientists group the International Committee for the Recovery of the VaquitaThe only way to restore the vaquita the experts said would be to shut down the illegal totoaba trade and impose severe new restrictions on the shrimp fisheries here when the season begins on SaturdayWere encouraging them to reinvent the northern gulf said Dr Taylor a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration I dont trivialize how difficult it will be These guys making millions of dollars trafficking in endangered species are not going to go quietlyNor will the local shrimp fishermenThey are more interested in the vaquita than in human beings Ral Gutirrez a fisherman in this town on the west side of the gulf said of the conservationistsUntil now the shrimp fishermen have been the focus of the effort to protect the vaquita in the northern Gulf of California Their long gillnets sway like curtains in the current and have been lethal to the porpoiseMexican officials say they are taking the committees recommendations to heart Eight navy speedboats are scheduled for delivery in the northern gulf over the next few weeks and more are expected next year The government will start aerial monitoring with two light planes and eventually drones said Rafael Pacchiano Alamn an under secretary with the Mexican Environment MinistryBut it may be the fishermen not the poachers who feel the rule of law first Mr Pacchiano said the authorities would also start enforcing regulations on the length of fishing nets 200 meters or about 220 yards Fishermen acknowledge that they typically set them five times as longThe prospect of new limits on how and where shrimp can be caught has caused anxiety in the gulfs northern fishing villagesCarlos Alberto Tirado the leader of one of the fishing federations in the small town of El Golfo de Santa Clara on the northeastern tip of the gulf said that scientists recommendation to ban all gillnets across a wide area of the northern gulf would wipe out the industryThey deal with conservation but they do not deal with how the communities will remain communities he said They would become ghost townsOfficials acknowledge that measures to save the vaquita will hurt the fishermen Its a big dilemma said Juan Jos Guerra Abud Mexicos environment secretary But without doubt the objective is to preserve it We are looking for what kind of stimulus what kind of support we can give to compensateConservationists argue that there is a way for fishermen to continue working without harming the vaquita by switching to baglike trawl nets that do not snare the porpoiseBut Antonio Garca Orozco a fisherman who has been working with environmental groups on the trawl nets design said it could not work when miles of gillnets are stretched out across the fishing grounds We need time and space to demonstrate that we can get 100 percent of the catchThe government had planned to phase in the new nets by 2016 But even the fishermen who made the switch voluntarily say they cannot provide for their familiesWe are considered the heroes of the vaquita because we were the first to change said Javier Valverde 66 one of the few fishermen to have seen the elusive animal But we are losing a lotThe jolt of urgency now comes after the government has already spent about 55 million since 2007 to protect the vaquitaIt began paying compensation to fishermen for the loss of fishing grounds after an area of 1260 square kilometers or 486 square miles was declared offlimits as a vaquita refuge in 2005 There was another subsidy to change to trawl nets Then there was a payout to encourage the fishermen to switch to tourism but few could make it workStill there was progress The population decline fell to 45 percent a year by 2010 about half of what it was in earlier yearsThe totoaba trade reversed that speeding up the loss to 185 percent a yearThe authorities on both sides of the MexicanUnited States border are just beginning to get a glimpse of how totoaba smuggling works Last year after officials at the Calexico border crossing in California found 27 totoaba bladders hidden in Song Shen Zhens car they searched his house and discovered 214 more laid out under whirring fans  a haul worth more than 36 million on the Asian black market the authorities saidThen came the June murder in El Golfo de Santa Clara of Samuel Gallardo Castro a prosperous fisherman whom Mexican military authorities had linked to drug trafficking A suspected hit man suggested that Mr Gallardo was shot over an unpaid totoaba debtThe distinction between legal fishermen and totoaba poachers is fuzzier than many here would like to admit Indebted fishermen may find it hard to resist the temptation to solve their problems by catching one totoaba  and then anotherAs they wait for the promised government action to materialize many fishermen are skeptical it will do much goodEvery year its the same Jos Luis Romero said The promise is This time really we will put security in place They go out one day two days and thats itMr Romero with a bushy gray beard cuts an eccentric figure in this town of cowboy boots and pickup trucks He is different in another way He believes that the vaquita is worth savingIt would be a shame if it were lost through our negligence he said ours the fishermen,2014-09-15T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/technology/the-unrepentant-bootlegger.html,Early in the morning of June 30 2010 Hana Beshara woke to a sharp rapping on the door of her condo in East Brunswick NJI heard a bangbangbang she said Im thinking its like AmazonIt wasnt a delivery It was a team of federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security wearing bulletproof jackets and carrying gunsShe sank into her couch and watched as they went through her belongings confiscating files her flatscreen TV several computers and cellphones her PlayStation 3  anything with a hard driveMs Beshara was one of the founders of a site called NinjaVideo which at the time was one of the most popular places online to illegally stream and download TV shows and moviesAt its peak the site attracted 26 million visitors a day and had around 60000 registered members many of whom visited the websites community section to discuss topics as diverse as philosophy parenting and politics Under the nickname Queen Phara Ms Beshara held court in these forums where she was known for her hottempered and playful online personalityNinjaVideo had a short life It went live in February 2008 and was yanked offline after the raid in June 2010 But its audacity was dazzling  impressive even The layout was simple a single scrolling web page with the names of popular television shows that were shown on cable and network television channels that week Clicking on show titles  like The Colbert Report or Lost  caused a video player to open and the show would begin Watching illegal downloads was almost as simple as flipping on the TV Few who used it were surprised when it was shutteredTo the government Ms Beshara was a thief plain and simple The Motion Picture Association of America alerted the federal government to NinjaVideo and nine other moviestreaming sites and they all went dark at the same time The raids were carried out by several federal agencies working to combat counterfeiting and piracy and the scale of the operation was meant to send a warning that the government wasnt ignoring the freewheeling world of illegal online streaming and downloadingMs Beshara however still cant accept that what she was doing deserved the heavy hammer of the law She served 16 months in prison for conspiracy and criminal copyright infringement but she still talks about NinjaVideo as something grand It was a portal that spirited her away from the doldrums of her regular life as a receptionist living with her parents to an online community that regarded her as its queen Sure she showed movies that were still playing in theaters but it seemed like harmless smallstakes funIn hindsight  I know its nave  but I never imagined it going criminal she said It didnt seem like it was something to be bothered with Even if it is wrongShe is not the only one who feels that way It has proved very difficult to reverse a pervasive cultural nonchalance about what constitutes intellectual property theft on the web Despite the government crackdown in 2010 and subsequent efforts to unplug websites that host or link to illegal content new sites have emerged that filled the void that NinjaVideo left behindOnline piracy is thriving Filesharing most of it illegal still amounts to nearly a quarter of all consumer Internet traffic according to Cisco Systems Visual Networking Index And a recent report from Tru Optik a media analytics firm said that nearly 10 billion movies television shows and other files including games and pornography were downloaded globally in the second quarter of 2014 Tru Optik estimates that about 6 percent of those downloads were legal In July a highquality version of The Expendables 3 the Sylvester Stallone action comedy film surfaced online and was downloaded millions of times well before its release in theatersCongressional efforts like a proposed Stop Online Piracy Act or SOPA introduced in 2011 met with such strident objections from the technology industry that lawmakers backed down The Copyright Alert System a voluntary effort by Internet service providers sends warnings when downloading of copyrighted content is detected but it is widely considered to be ineffective Last year 13 million warnings were sent a fraction of what Tru Optik estimates to be 400 million illegal downloads in the United States each monthThe situation has reached an uneasy stasis that pleases no one Internet advocates say that policing individuals or smalltime pirates with outdated laws ignores how ordinary people view entertainment in the real world And despite its best efforts the MPAA has yet to completely extinguish the unauthorized distribution of movies and television showsAfter she got out of prison in April 2013 Ms Beshara now 32 lived with her parents But she recently moved into an apartment in Newark with a woman she met on Craigslist Ms Besharas room is spacious but bare containing just a mattress on the floor and a few decorative items including a blanket she knitted in prison and artwork created by members of the NinjaVideo community In person Ms Beshara is prone to tears when talking about her past but she makes jokes about it as well An email exchange between Ms Beshara and her lawyers forwarded to me had the line Its me your favorite convictMs Beshara spent her early years in Brooklyn the child of Egyptian immigrants When she wasnt studying she helped out at her parents car service company dispatching rides I didnt have much of a childhood she said sitting on the edge of her mattress and dressed in a burntorange wrap smoking a clove cigarette She remembers clearly the day she came across a man selling copies of The Lion King on the street for 10 Watching it she realized that it had been made by someone covertly filming it in theatersI remember thinking that they were a hero she said That was my first bootleg momentA few years later her parents moved the family to Parlin NJ and Ms Beshara graduated from Sayreville War Memorial High School as valedictorian She enrolled in New York University and in 2003 graduated with a degree in political science Her future looked bright She dreamed about a career as a diplomat or as an important political figure perhapsBut after college she returned home and drifted She worked as a bartender and then as a receptionist in a dentists office a job that one of her mothers friends arranged as a favor I was figuring out what I wanted to do with myself she saidOne night while driving she was pulled over The police officer found marijuana in her car and she was charged with possession and later put on probation for a year The ordeal sent her into depression I felt like I was a step behind everyone Ms Beshara saidThe Internet became her escapeMs Beshara spent hours bingeing on shows like the sciencefiction drama Battlestar Galactica and eventually frequented chat rooms where people uploaded shows and movies Eventually she started doing the sameDuring this period she met Matthew Smith then 21 and living in North Carolina The two decided to build a different kind of streaming site one with highquality files and with chat forums interlaced with the content Ms Beshara would manage and moderate the forums Mr Smith would handle the technical back end NinjaVideo went up on February 2008 Within the first couple of weeks there were a few thousand videos on the site largely from volunteers It started to blow up very very quickly Ms Beshara saidJosh Evans one of NinjaVideos administrators hired in December 2009 said that working on the site was one of the funnest times of my life He lived outside Seattle and remembers traveling to New York and Greece to meet Ms Beshara and the other NinjaVideo administrators the gang even exchanged gifts around ChristmasWe were all a bit intoxicated with each other Ms Beshara saidBy day Ms Beshara went through the motions of her job After work she made a beeline for her computer where she sometimes stayed until dawn She logged into NinjaVideo and Skype where she and the other moderators coordinated the shows going online that evening They waited for their network of uploaders who used special software to tape shows directly from television and upload them to a cyberlocker or hosting site From there shows and movies would be posted on NinjaVideoIt was an internal race to get the shows up Ms Beshara said Each night on average 10 to 15 shows went online The forums were particularly active at night and thats when Ms Beshara came alive as Queen PharaShe was a bit intimidating said Candee Edwards a former comment moderator for NinjaVideo a  you either love her or you hate her kind of deal If you said something stupid you would get called out But she was always on point always on top of thingsUnknown to Ms Beshara and her collaborators NinjaVideo had been targeted by the Motion Picture Association of America which says the site aided in the infringement of millions of dollars worth of copyrighted movies television programs and software products NinjaVideo went live the same year as Hulu and Netflix Instant Netflixs video streaming service and the MPAA was trying to reroute Internet users to legitimate online streaming outlets like them The MPAA identified what it saw as other offending sites too like NinjaThiscom and TVShacknet and funneled the names to the government Eventually those sites went offline as wellIn a nationwide campaign called Operation In Our Sites undercover federal agents investigated and found dozens of movies on NinjaVideo including some still in theaters The agents didnt need to dig deep to prove that Ms Beshara and her collaborators were aware that their activity was illegal Dozens of threads on the site gleefully acknowledged  even gloated over  the illicit nature of the contentLike Ms Beshara Mr Evans had his home raided in 2010 He pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and copyright infringement and was sentenced to six months in federal prison in Connecticut Now 37 Mr Evans has returned to his home near Seattle where he works as a computer and electronics repairman Mr Smith who could not be reached to be interviewed was sentenced to 14 months in prison for conspiracy and criminal copyright infringementAdministrators of NinjaVideo were the first to be charged criminally as a result of Operation In Our Sites numerous other domain names would be seized and a handful of arrests made In 2012 the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation had their splashiest success They seized and shut down Megaupload the popular digital locker site that allowed people to share files like movies and music anonymously and arrested its owner Kim Dotcom along with several other highlevel executives They have been indicted by the United States on charges related to copyright infringement although many legal experts are not sure if a case will ever come to courtAfter the seizure of NinjaVideo and the other sites the MPAA pushed federal legislation to continue to crack down on illegal downloading But the bill SOPA was so loosely worded that it could have required all websites to be responsible for monitoring their services for potential violations  an expensive and nearly impossible challenge  prompting sites like Wikipedia Tumblr and Craigslist to rally online sentiment against the legislation Outrage about the bill came to a head in 2012 and lawmakers backed offOperation In Our Sites still exists primarily focused on trying to prosecute the Megaupload case But the campaign didnt stop unauthorized viewing Instead the next generation of rogue services  including Popcorn Time which TechCrunch a technology blog described as Netflix for pirates  learned from the mistakes of sites like NinjaVideo Operating primarily on American soil NinjaVideo was especially vulnerable to prosecution Newer sites established themselves overseas out of the American governments reach They also tended to avoid forums and incriminating public statements that prosecutors could use against themThe MPAA meanwhile says it is not pursuing any new legislation to crack down on copyright infringement online focusing instead on educating consumers about legal streaming optionsThe goal is not so much to use mitigation factors to stop them from pirating but showing them the alternatives that are out there said Michael D Robinson the chief of operations and content protection for the MPAA We are working on getting young people to understand the importance and value of copyright protectionBut that task he said is unfortunately at this point neverendingIt is difficult to compete with free he addedThat said the MPAA says that the number of legitimate streaming outlets has doubled to 100 since 2009 and that Americans legally consumed 57 billion movies and 56 billion TV shows in 2013 alonePeople watch more paid legal content than ever but they also continue to download huge amounts of illegal content Piracy is putting pressure on antiquated business models which isnt necessarily a bad thing said Brett Danaher an economics professor at Wellesley College who studies Internet piracy But the prevalence of piracy shows that people are growing up in a culture of free and that is not good for the future of entertainment eitherEven if it were possible to shut down every illegal site tomorrow new ones would surely pop up The demand is there One study by the American Assembly at Columbia University found that 70 percent of young adults between 18 and 29 had copied or downloaded music or video free and almost 30 percent got most of their collections that way The pervasive cultural norm especially among younger people is that illegal downloading at least when it involves material from big corporations is no big deal Andrs MonroyHernndez a social computing researcher at Microsoft Research studied attitudes around ownership on collaborative usergenerated websites He found that young Internet users became angry when peers used their works without permission but didnt see a problem in lifting images from shows or movies for use in their own workThe farther removed you feel from the source he said the more likely you are to disregard the copyright and the intellectual propertyThere is another obstacle to stopping illegal downloads said Andre Swanston the chief executive of Tru Optik the media analytics firm People want access to everything anytime and there is little to stop them from having it Even if you added Netflix Hulu Plus Amazon Prime Sony Crackle and everything else combined that is still less content available legally than illegally he said The popularity of piracy has nothing to do with cost  it is all about accessComplex exclusivity agreements between networks and streaming sites govern when popular television shows are available But people are not always willing to hop among a streaming service a site or an app to watch different shows Mr Swanston gave the example of how ABC in January started requiring people to verify that they had a cable subscription to watch its shows on Hulu Users either didnt have the necessary information or declined to go the extra step it seems because the rate of piracy for Marvels Agents of SHIELD a network drama shot up 300 percentContent providers Mr Swanston says will eventually have to consider new delivery models that are more closely aligned with how people behave He imagines collaborations with streaming services to release content or simultaneously scheduling theater and digital streaming releases  ideas he hopes his company can help bring about Some companies like BitTorrent which makes filesharing technology are already experimenting in this arenaThe law too needs to adapt to the reality of how people behave said Peter Eckersley technology projects director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation a nonprofit advocacy group that pushes for digital rights among other thingsMr Eckersley said the law should shift its focus to making sure that copyright holders are paid for their work rather than trying to stymie how people gain access to it Subscriptionbased music services like Rdio and Spotify seem to be helping prevent music piracy  although the argument about whether artists are fairly compensated rages onHe suggested a legal framework to retire the exclusive rights aspect of copyright law that requires permission to publish  and that allows copyright holders to seek exorbitant damages from infringers  and move toward a system that requires sites and people who make money from anothers work to share any profits Solutions like these Mr Eckersley says would create different priorities that go beyond chasing smalltime pirates like Ms Beshara and her colleaguesNinjaVideo made about 500000 over three years according to the government Most of that came from advertising but also from donations and a 25 fee for access to private chat boardsMs Beshara kept the bulk of the pot around 210000 which she is required to pay back to the MPAA She says she netted only about half of that but she is gradually repaying the amount The rest was divided among four other cofounders and administrators who helped run the site and manage the communityShe acknowledges that some of her colleagues were upset when they learned she received much of the profit from NinjaVideo but says it wasnt out of line with her role as the voice of the site People took issue with the fact that I got paid she said At any rate in her opinion the money was insignificant To this day she argues that the movie business is so big that skimming a little off the top doesnt hurt anybody She likes to say that NinjaVideo was operating in a gray areaMs Beshara refused to muster any remorse during her sentencing and often took to social media between court appearances to boast about her lack of repentance This enraged the judge presiding over her caseDavid Smith one of the lawyers appointed to represent Ms Beshara compared her behavior to that of another class of clients he often works with drug traffickers The thrill is similar he said and many find themselves addicted to the lifestyle even more than the profitsA lot of them are in it for the sheer joy of doing it Mr Smith said Theres a lot of excitement and ego gratification in being a successful traffickerPrison wasnt easy for Ms Beshara She got into scuffles with other inmates including one that landed her in solitary confinement for a monthShe learned to crochet and taught a jewelrymaking class She worked in the prison kitchen preparing food for a few cents an hour Her family didnt visit NinjaVideo community members including Ms Edwards the moderator supplied Ms Beshara with phone cards and put money in her commissary account so she could buy basic items like shampoo and snacksAfter 16 months in prison Ms Beshara spent an additional five at a halfway house in New Jersey Her parole prohibits her from corresponding with her former NinjaVideo colleagues or from starting a business online until August 2015All said and done its about five years before Im allowed to really be back online she said They hurt me with thatShe works full time as human resources manager at an Internet sales company that she likes fine enough and on the weekends she shuttles across town to a food coop where she makes coffees and vegetable wraps as part of her mandatory community service Her new life lacks the excitement and thrill of NinjaVideo but when she lapses into thinking about the old days she lights up with excitement and longing I would never take it back she said,2014-09-28T00:00:00Z,drugs

had been dead for days by the time he led investigators to the spot where they had been dumped among dead trees and scrub brushThe childrens journey to that isolated hilltop in central Alabama covered hundreds of miles and crisscrossed several Southeastern states as Jones drove his Cadillac Escalade around for days using bleach to try to mask the smell of the decomposing bodies authorities said WednesdayJones was arrested Saturday at a DUI checkpoint in Mississippi about 500 miles from his hometown of Lexington South Carolina An officer said he smelled the stench of death along with chemicals used to make methamphetamine and synthetic marijuana Jones was acting strangely and appeared somewhat disoriented said Lewis McCarty the acting sheriff in LexingtonCourt documents show the childrens brief lives were troubled marred for years by discord between their parents The divorce between Jones and his wife Amber finalized 11 months ago included multiple allegations of adultery against the woman and resulted in the children bouncing back and forth between their home in South Carolina and northeastern Mississippi where Jones family livesA therapist who saw the man more than two years ago described him as highly intelligent and responsible yet emotionally devastated and angry over his wifes alleged infidelity court records show Still authorities said they dont know why the children were slain or how or exactly when Autopsies were scheduled to begin ThursdayJones 32 confessed to killing his children ages 1 to 8 and dumping their bodies in the secluded clearing authorities said The computer engineer who had a degree from Mississippi State University was working for Intel when he disappeared with his children the company said At the time of his divorce he was making about 71000 a yearThe sheriff said Jones apparently acted alone and will be charged with five counts of murder Authorities have seized his computerJones father made a brief statement but directed questions attorney Boyd Young who would represent his son Youngs office in South Carolina refused to confirm that it is representing Jones and declined to commentAuthorities believe the children were killed at the same time likely soon after they were last seen alive in late August Jones had moved with the children to a neighborhood of mobile homes in Lexington after the October 2013 divorce and the children had slowly started disappearing from view said neighbor Dorothy WoodI didnt even hear them playing outside any more I thought they had moved Wood saidJones stepmother Julie Jones of Amory Mississippi called the children beautifulThey were wonderful They were happy Jones said as she criedDivorce records listed the five children as Merah 8 Elias 7 Nahtahn 6 Gabriel 2 and Elaine Marie 1 Elaine Marie was born Abagail Elizabeth but the parents agreed to a name change records showIn Lexington there was an abuse complaint against Jones lodged on Aug 7 but when deputies and an official with the Department of Social Services went out to the house they interviewed the children and didnt see anything to alarm them Officials wouldnt say who made the complaintThe case has unfolded over the past two weeks but it wasnt until Tuesday afternoon  when authorities found the childrens bodies  that they went publicWe were trying to balance the children and the investigation against the releasing of information McCarty saidThe children were last seen Aug 28 The older children were at school and Jones picked up his younger kids at daycare He was to bring the children to their mothers home Sept 2 but never showed upTheir mother Jones exwife reported them missing Sept 3 South Carolina Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel said authorities did not issue an Amber Alert because the case didnt meet the criteria  Jones had legal custody of his childrenWith the children already dead and stowed inside the vehicle Jones left their home on a journey that took him to North Carolina Georgia Alabama and finally Mississippi authorities said In all he covered about 700 miles in what the Lexington sheriff called a logistical nightmareIn Pine Apple 20 miles off Interstate 65 and about 65 miles south of Montgomery Mayor Chris Stone said he was cutting his grass Saturday morning when he saw a man driving a black Escalade along Alabama 10 a twolane highway where logging trucks are more common than luxury SUVs The man was driving slowly like he was looking for something Stone saidHe was going out toward where the bodies were found Stone saidThe same day apparently after the bodies were atop the hill Jones stopped to use an automatic teller at a bank in the nearby town of Camden said District Attorney Michael Jackson Authorities havent found anything linking Jones to Alabama Jackson said and the hill may have been picked simply because it was hidden from viewThey think it was just a location thing being a rural area Jackson saidOn Saturday night about nine hours after the mayor saw the Escalade Jones was stopped about 190 miles away at a checkpoint in Smith County Mississippi authorities saidWhen authorities ran his license plate they discovered Jones and his children had been reported missing by their mother Late Monday Jones confessed to deputies that he had killed them and dumped their bodies said Charlie Crumpton sheriff of Smith County MississippiThe childrens mother Jones exwife is in shock and distraught McCarty told reportersI want you to know that she lost five vital body parts he said A very nice person a very sweet ladyJones father Timothy Jones Sr of Amory Mississippi said the familys hearts were broken and he called his son a loving dadWe do not have all the answers and we may never have them he said in

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/the-bud-light-ification-of-bud.html,There are many things that bother Jon Cooper about the market for marijuanaIts nearly impossible to find a consistent product said Cooper one of the legion of tech startup guys and MBAs plunging into the world of pot You go into a dispensary and buy something called Sour Diesel and try it You go to another dispensary buy Sour Diesel and its a different experience You go back to the first dispensary buy it again and its not the same eitherDespite the inconsistency nobody doubts marijuanas popularity as a consumer product 38 percent of Americans admit to having tried it and 7 percent use it on a regular basis But for decades it has been produced and sold primarily on the black market which has only recently developed shades of gray and whiteThis has wrenched the ancient psychotropic substance into the machinery of 21stcentury consumer capitalism  with all the consultants marketers brand advisers and scientists that come with it A joint might never be as easy to access as a can of beer or a cigarette But thousands of people and millions of dollars are hard at work to make it as predictable and dependable as one Call it the Bud Lightification of budTheres a pressing economic reason for the pot industry to get better if it is to survive aside from its formidable legal challenges The plant is relatively cheap and easy to grow and not complicated to process either Left to the whims of the open market  meaning ignoring taxes and regulations  the price of a joint could plummet to the price of a tea bag or a packet of sugar So how will investors help the market mature while still making moneyThe market for marijuana is nothing like the market for corn or wine or tobacco  at least not yet  and the reasons start in the ground Marijuana growing and processing is downright bushleague compared to modern American agribusiness Much of the pot produced in the United States still comes from illegal or semilegal grow sites even given the surge of production and processing in states with recreational or medicinal laws And strains remain understudied and underanalyzed compared with the wheat in your cereal or even the marigolds in your gardenThe inefficiencies continue to pile up after the harvest Marijuana has to be cured then trimmed before it is sold and much of this work is still done by hand Workers use scissors to cut away tough outer leaves and expose the smokable part of the plant Its a laborintensive process the kind that in other instances is completed by a machine like a thresher or a cotton ginAlready the booming industry has started ironing things out Growers House a Tucsonbased indoor gardening center offers a wide variety of mechanical trimmers on its website At the low end for a few hundred dollars they resemble salad spinners studded with blades on the high end they look more like propane grills One of these the Triminator 17900 can process 18 pounds of material in an hour  90 times faster than handtrimming by the companys own estimatePeter Adams the executive director of Rockies Venture Club an investment group that is researching the cannabis industry thinks numbers like that mean an inevitable plunge in the price of pot People selling the ancillary products wont see that Adams said Youre still going to have the same cost for LEDs soil heating ventilation air conditioning those thingsWith costs and prices falling producers might try to scramble up the value chain complicating or sophisticating their offerings to get an edge Why sell nail polish when you can sell French manicures More to the point why sell cornmeal when you can sell Doritos There theyre going to have to do a better job of luring and keeping customers if they want to midwife pot into the great big American consumer market where consistency is kingCrack open a can of Bud Light then another and another The beers should taste identical Try the same with a McDonalds hamburger a Marlboro red a stick of Wrigleys gum or even a glass of namebrand middlemarket wine Unless something has gone terribly wrong it should feel as if you were sipping or smoking or eating the exact same product again and again and againIn spite of marijuanas significant popularity there is still an element of roulette when it comes to smoking a legal joint or eating a legal brownie Federal law does not require companies to test for and disclose levels of the drugs active ingredients like tetrahydrocannabinol Federal law does not hold that pot is legal after all Many dispensaries and producers fail to test for potency contaminants or mold And different states have different disclosure laws with different levels of efficacy As such a gram of AK47 bought in an Oakland dispensary might affect you differently than a gram of the same purchased in Colorado As Cooper pointed out What is AK47 supposed to be anywayCoopers lament also applies to the realm of edibles where marijuana oils and snacks can vary wildly in quality and potency A recent study by The Denver Post for instance revealed large disparities between the amount of THC stated on an edible items package and what the product actually contained Usually the problem was underdosing One chocolate Star Barz had 037 milligrams of the drugs main psychoactive component when it had been advertised as having 100 milligramsUnder a commercial system the rules could be a lot tighter said Mark Kleiman of the University of California Los Angeles an adviser to Washington StateRight now you have some products where youre supposed to eat say an eighth of a cookie Whos going to take a circular cookie and geometrically divide that friable object into eighthsSensing the opportunity for something more predictable Cooper and his partner at Ebbu a Colorado pot startup are creating a variety of predosed products  like prerolled joints or little Listerinestyle strips They have eschewed the silly strain names instead labeling their products highenergy relaxed bliss create and gigglesLauren Ely a librarian from Erie Colo is working on a startup called DisposaBowls  prepacked disposable ceramic pipesI joke around and tell everyone Im the old fat Nancy Botwin she said referring to the character from the Showtime show Weeds She said that she hoped the product would appeal to experienced smokers looking for a convenient way to bring the product with them while they go on a hike for example But she also saw it as a good way to introduce novices seniors and medicinal smokers to pot with gentle predictable resultsThe legal pressure on even legitimate marijuana businesses helps to explain much of the immaturity by scaring away capital both monetary and human The industry until now has mostly been made up of potheads and lawbreakers after all But the investors I spoke with said that pitches have gotten better and money has been rushing in tooDespite the potential many investors are still hesitating at spending the money that might make joints and brownies less ad hoc more corporate Why spend 20 million on a grow site that might be shut down or a new brand that might get stamped out by the next administrations Justice Department A surfeit of laws  and confusion between them  is holding the market backIts a little bit like Alice in Wonderland said Adams of Rockies Venture Club All the rules of physics are broken and youre trying to figure your way through a strange place To be fair it will probably feel like that to new consumers

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/us/beards-in-prison-hold-next-religion-test-for-supreme-court.html,WASHINGTON   When the Supreme Court comes back from its summer break next month it will pick up where it left off returning to the subject of religious freedom But the courts focus will shift from corporations to prisonersOn the final day of the last term in June the justices ruled in the Hobby Lobby case that some corporations could refuse to provide contraception coverage to their workers on religious groundsThe new case to be argued on Oct 7 the second day of the next term concerns whether prison officials may prohibit Muslim inmates from growing the beards required by their faithsThe juxtaposition of the two cases may color the justices analysis in the second one said Marci A Hamilton a law professor at Cardozo Law SchoolAfter going out on a limb by providing newfound rights to corporations she said are they now going to turn around and say that prisoners cant grow beardsThe justices will apply a familiar legal test to decide the case As in the Hobby Lobby case they will consider whether the challenged government regulation placed a substantial burden on religious practices If it did the government must show that it had a compelling reason for the regulation and no better way to achieve itThe new case was brought by an Arkansas inmate Gregory H Holt who is serving a life sentence for burglary and domestic battery Mr Holt also known as Abdul Maalik Muhammad sought to grow a halfinch beardMore than 40 state prison systems allow such beards which are shorter than a dime Most allow longer ones The exceptions according to Mr Holts brief are Alabama Arkansas Florida Georgia South Carolina Texas and VirginiaIn Arkansas prison regulations allow neatly trimmed mustaches along with quarterinch beards for inmates with dermatologic problems Other kinds of beards are bannedAt a 2012 hearing in Mr Holts case prison officials testified that the strict policy was a result of security concernsEven short beards one said could conceal anything from razor blades to drugs to homemade darts Another said that SIM cards for cellphones could also be hidden in beardsThe two officials conceded however that there are many other places to hide contraband including clothes shoes and body cavitiesMagistrate Judge Joe J Volpe of the Federal District Court in Little Rock said he saw little reason to make Mr Holt shave the short beard he wore in courtIts almost preposterous to think that you could hide contraband in your beard Judge Volpe said But theres a bigger picture hereJudge Volpe ruled against Mr Holt saying that prison officials security assessments deserved deference A district judge and an appeals court agreedIn their Supreme Court brief Arkansas officials listed other kinds of contraband that might be hidden in beards needles pieces of wire broken glass gum caulk tobacco marijuana and powdered drugs The officials told the justices that they should not be required to produce evidence that prisoners actually used beards as hiding placesCourts should not insist on studies data or concrete examples the brief said Prisons are dangerous places it said and the judgments of those in charge are entitled to deferenceThe states brief did provide one example based on testimony last year from Ray Hobbs the director of the states corrections department and the lead defendant in Mr Holts lawsuit The testimony came in a hearing concerning a different prisoner who sought to grow a beard for religious reasonsAsked whether he knew of prisoners who got caught concealing contraband within their beards Mr Hobbs described an incident the month before An inmate fresh out of county jail he said concealed a part of a razor blade and later on that night committed suicide with itThe states Supreme Court brief filed in July cited that testimony But it was only partly trueAn inmate named Steven Oldham did kill himself with a razor on Aug 8 2013 in Malvern Ark But he did so according to a sworn statement from the coroner by using an orange plastic disposable razor that had been issued to him by prison authorities so he could shave his beardDouglas Laycock one of Mr Holts lawyers said Supreme Court briefs should meet a higher standard of factual accuracy This kind of flat misrepresentation to the court however it happened he said doesnt happen very oftenA reply brief from Mr Holt pointed out the error and lawyers from the state attorney generals office promptly wrote a letter to the court disavowing their earlier account of the incident The testimony of Director Hobbs concerning Mr Oldham they wrote to the Supreme Court was erroneous in stating that the razor was concealed in a beardThrough a spokesman Mr Hobbs said he does not wish to offer comments about how he came to give false testimony A spokesman for the state attorney generals office which represents Mr Hobbs in the Supreme Court declined to elaborate on the offices letter to the justicesMr Laycock said the disavowal in the letter was significant This was their only example he saidProfessor Hamilton of Cardozo Law School said there were authentic security concerns in play in the case There has to be a real thumb on the side of deference to the prison she said particularly because prisoners have no shame in claiming to be members of any religionThere is a real risk she added that prisons face with facial hairThe state told the justices that it had other concerns beyond the smuggling of contraband Merely having to inspect beards the states brief said may be dangerous Razor blades dirty needles or other items could cut correctional officers the brief saidMr Holt responded that prisoners could be made to run their hands vigorously through their own beardsThe state added that allowing beards would make it easy for escaped prisoners to alter their appearance Mr Holt responded that the prison authorities could take pictures of inmates with and without beardsLast year the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in St Louis ruled that the states justifications were sufficient to prohibit Mr Holt from growing a beard Mr Holt then filed a handwritten petition asking the justices to hear his case Holt v Hobbs No 136827 pointing out that other courts had struck down policies banning beards in prisonsIn an interim order in November the Supreme Court said Mr Holt must for now be allowed to grow a halfinch beardIn addition to Mr Laycock who teaches law at the University of Virginia Mr Holt is represented by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty which also represented Hobby Lobby the chain of crafts stores that won last terms religious liberty caseThe two cases are quite different said Ira

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/opinion/charles-blow-war-against-whites-i-think-not.html,When Representative Mo Brooks Republican of Alabama claimed earlier this week that Democrats were waging a war on whites he lifted the lid on a simmering resentment that is very real and very resilient and feeds on anxiety  and fear  about a changing America and the possibility of those changes upending historical architectures of privilegeOn Monday Brooks was on Laura Ingrahams radio show to talk about Republicans deportation policies She played a clip of Ron Fournier of National Journal on Fox News sayingThe fastestgrowing voting block in this country thinks the Republican Party hates them This party your party cannot be the party of the future beyond November if youre seen as the party of white peopleIngraham asked Brooks to respond to the clip and he didThis is a part of the war on whites thats being launched by the Democratic Party And the way in which theyre launching this war is by claiming that whites hate everybody else Its part of the strategy that Barack Obama implemented in 2008 continued in 2012 where he divides us all on race on sex greed envy class warfare all those kinds of thingsThis is a paranoid delusion wrapped in a staggering deflection inside an utter lack of personal  or party  accountabilityRepublicans have been digging a trench between themselves and racial minorities for decades One could argue that it began when President Lyndon B Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and reportedly lamented that in doing so he was assuring that Democrats had lost the South for a generation a kind of political white flight of Southern whites to the Republican PartyThe racial divisiveness became part of the party plan in the 1970s with the Southern Strategy when Richard Nixons political strategist Kevin Phillips told The New York Times Magazine The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South the sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become RepublicansThen Nixon declared a war on drugs in 1971 which is one of the longestrunning most disastrous programs  in both wasted money and wasted lives  in the history of this countryAfter more than 40 million drug arrests and 1 trillion spent what do we have to show for it For one an obscene bloated massincarceration system According to the Sentencing Project The United States is the worlds leader in incarceration with 22 million people currently in the nations prisons or jails  a 500 percent increase over the past thirty yearsFurthermore the antidrug campaign has become increasingly focused on arrests for marijuana  a substance that is now legal in some states and whose potential legality is picking up steam in others  and among those arrested exists an unconscionable racial disparity As the ACLU has pointed outDespite the fact that whites engage in drug offenses at a higher rate than AfricanAmericans AfricanAmericans are incarcerated for drug offenses at a rate that is 10 times greater than that of whitesThe racial divisiveness was further accelerated in the 1976 presidential campaign when Ronald Reagan continually invoked the specter of a lecherous welfareabusing woman from Chicago  the Welfare Queen the media dubbed her  who he saidHas 80 names 30 addresses 12 Social Security cards and is collecting veterans benefits on four nonexisting deceased husbands And she is collecting Social Security on her cards Shes got Medicaid getting food stamps and she is collecting welfare under each of her names Her taxfree cash income is over 150000The object of the anecdote was reported to be a woman named Linda TaylorOnly as a Washington Star article printed in The Times pointed out in February of 1976 The problem is that the story does not quite check outAs the article explainedAfter a series of indictments each one of which was replaced by another indictment winnowing down the number of charges Miss Taylor is now charged with using not 80 aliases but four The amount the state is charging that she received from her alleged fraud is not 150000 but 8000The article concluded The welfare queen item in Mr Reagans repertoire is one of several that seem to be at odds with the factsThe racial divisiveness continued in 1988 when George Bushs supporters used the Willie Horton attack ad against Michael DukakisIt continues as Republicans trade racial terms for culturecentric euphemisms Newt Gingrich in 2011 Really poor children in really poor neighborhoods have no habits of working and have nobody around them who works although most poor people of working age work Paul Ryan earlier this year We have got this tailspin of culture in our inner cities in particular of men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work And Bill OReilly said recently in a discussion about legalizing marijuana that the lefts position was that marijuana was harmless and Its blacks you know you get youre trapping the blacks because in certain ghetto neighborhoods its part of the cultureAdd the Obama birthers voter suppression laws congressional obstruction and Republicans in the House voting to sue the president and it becomes clear Democrats didnt drive a wedge between Republicans and blacks Republicans drove blacks away Blacks have voted more than 80 percent Democratic in every election since at least 1972 and that percentage was over 90 percent in both of Obamas electionsAnd in the Obama era  despite what Mo Brooks says  Republicans are not only solidifying their division with blacks but solidifying a divide with Hispanics as wellIn 2008 most of the people voting for Barack Obama were white In fact as Ive pointed out before even if every black person in America had stayed home on Election Day that year Obama would still have wonBut during Obamas term as a Gallup poll found in March more whites have moved away from the Democratic Party and toward the Republican Party It was yet more white flightAs for Hispanics Republicans seemed to make some headway when George W Bush who supported a pathway to citizenship was in the White House They shrank a 50point Democratic advantage among Hispanic voters in 1982 to just 12 points in 2004 But congressional Republicans destroyed that trend by passing an enforcementonly immigration bill in 2005 sparking nationwide protests and leading to a 2006 midterm election in which the Democratic advantage among Hispanic voters for House races soared again to 48 percentage pointsSince then we have seen further antiimmigrant legislation like Arizonas ShowMeYourPapers law Congresss failure to move on comprehensive immigration and opposition to efforts to help the Dreamers It has now culminated in an ugly conservative reaction to the humanitarian crisis of undocumented children from Central American arriving at our southern borderIt should be noted here that Hispanic is an ethnicity not a race Hispanics can be of any race and a recent Pew Research report found that they are increasingly identifying themselves as whiteWhites are not under attack by Democrats Republicans like Brooks are simply stoking racial fears to hide their history of racially regressive policies,2014-08-07T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/us/officials-focus-on-e-cigarette-ads-aimed-at-youths.html,PARK CITY Utah   State attorneys general must investigate and consider taking legal action against ecigarette companies that appear to be using some of the same advertising tactics that once drew young adults into smoking a Kentucky deputy attorney general told his law enforcement colleagues gathered here for a retreat to discuss emerging legal issues in states nationwideThe gathering of nearly two dozen attorneys general and senior members of their staffs came on the 20th anniversary of the initiation of the historic lawsuit that states filed against tobacco companies  resulting ultimately in an approximately 10 billion annual payment which is still being made and an agreement to restrict advertising everywhere from outdoor billboards to sports events to try to curtail the appeal of tobacco to youthsSean Riley the chief deputy attorney general of Kentucky told his law enforcement colleagues that Kentucky had left behind its status as the state with the highest percentage of youth smokers But he said he was concerned that ecigarette advertising could reverse that progress He cited several examplesHe said that the nicotine in ecigarettes was not healthy for young people and that ecigarettes whose use has surged among schoolage children nationwide might be turning into a gateway to cigarette smoking instead of a way to quitWe are at the very beginning stages of a new sort of revolutionary product here Mr Riley said We need to be prepared to work individually and collectively to use our consumer protection acts to raise the floor of conduct we are seeingJeffrey Weiss the general counsel at NJOY an independently owned ecigarette company said he agreed that the state and federal authorities must move to adopt regulations appropriately governing ecigarettes such as limiting sales to youthsBut he said that the industrys growth was actually a public health boon given the role that ecigarettes can play in helping people quit smoking cancercausing tobacco cigarettesWe can save millions of lives Mr Weiss saidAttorney General Tom Miller of Iowa a Democrat who has been in office since the tobacco case was settled in 1998 said that law enforcement officials must tread carefullyThe price of getting it wrong either way is high Mr Miller told his colleagues He noted that if they did not regulate the industry properly ecigarettes might increase tobacco use among youths but that if they regulated it too intensely it might limit the effectiveness of ecigarettes as a way to quit tobaccoAmong the problems with the ecigarette industry according to Mr Riley and other senior law enforcement officials at the meeting are ecigarettes with flavors like Cherry Crush and Peach Schnapps which are sold by the ecigarette company Blu and may be particularly appealing to childrenA letter signed by 40 state attorneys general last year urged the federal Food and Drug Administration to regulate ecigarettes addressing issues like advertising ingredients and sale to minorsBut the attorneys general already have the power under consumer protection laws to intervene against companies that make inappropriate health claims or sell items like nicotine refill cartridges that are not properly packaged to prevent them from being accidentally opened by a child and consumed Mr Riley saidMr Riley and Matthew L Myers president of the Campaign for TobaccoFree Kids both ran through a series of recent ecigarette advertisements that echo techniques once used by tobacco companies like cartoon characters that are using ecigarettes or advertisements that feature celebrities like Courtney Love and Robert PattinsonThe ecigarette industry has also started advertising at sporting events where tobacco ads are banned The problems are particularly acute the officials said with less traditional forms of advertising like on YouTube and other social media sitesToday as a result of the failure of the government to act swiftly the marketplace for ecigarettes is truly the Wild West Mr Myers saidOne question debated at the gathering this week has been whether state attorneys general should try to force ecigarette companies to comply with the same standards imposed on tobacco companies a proposal to which Mr Weiss of NJOY strongly objectedNJOY which intends to release its own line of flavored ecigarettes soon also objected to any move to try to limit the use of these flavors Mr Weiss said industrysponsored research had shown that tobacco smokers were much more likely to completely quit smoking when they used a flavored ecigaretteDavid B Abrams a researcher at the Legacy program which was funded by the tobacco settlement and does research to encourage the reduction of smoking told the attorneys general that medical research had shown that ecigarettes appeared to be about as effective as nicotine replacement therapy in helping people quit smoking But data also show that ecigarette use among youths who tried them at least once doubled from 2011 to 2012 reaching about 68 percentWhile gathered here in Park City for a retreat sponsored by the Conference of Western Attorneys General the law enforcement officials also talked about how best to deal with the legalization of marijuana taking place in certain statesAttorneys general from Washington State and Colorado where marijuana has recently been broadly legalized briefed other officials about problems they said they had encountered They cited edible marijuana products that are packaged in a way that can be appealing to children and that have insufficient labeling resulting in consumers eating an excessive amount of the drug and at times leading to accidents and even deathsAttorney General John W Suthers of Colorado said that the percentage of fatal car accidents attributed to marijuana use had jumped to 15 percent from 8 percent in the last three years He urged other attorneys general to prepare for possible legalization in their statesI encourage you not to be smug Mr Suthers who opposed the legalization said Its coming your way This is a very wellfinanced and wellorganized movement,2014-07-23T00:00:00Z,drugs

Dateline Read PerezHiltoncom Have you ever undergone a medical procedure that required an anestheticWelcome to jury service where the seats are hard and the questionnaires increasingly long and nosyIn a recently concluded federal racketeering trial in Brooklyn potential jurors were asked what public figures they admired the most and the least For a political corruption trial they were asked to list their three favorite movies and what the bumper stickers on their cars said For a current civil case concerning Israel they were asked if they had any feelings about Jews that would make it difficult for them to serveJury questionnaires have become a familiar presence in courtrooms across the United States with some lawyers routinely requesting them in major cases  transforming the standard voir dire procedure into a written testYou can learn a lot from a questionnaire that you cant learn in person said Daniel Gitner a defense lawyer in Manhattan noting that he preferred to use questionnaires You want to use a questionnaire anytime you have a real considered view of what beliefs your jurors are coming to the courtroom withAlong with instinct lawyers and the growing field of jury consultants generally use mock juries and posttrial quizzes of actual juries to sort out jurors views in a caseThe objective is to prune the jury box of people biased against their clientsPhilip K Anthony the chief executive of DecisionQuest a trial consultancy compared the work to epidemiology what patterns exist in the population in the data that might make jurors more likely to find for one side or anotherIn the federal corruption trial of Pedro Espada Jr who served in the New York State Senate potential jurors in Brooklyn were asked whether they had ever worked as janitors business owners or at hospitals whether their employer gave them an expense account and whether they managed the money in their householdsFor the trial of five associates of Bernard L Madoff in Manhattan proposed questions asked for parents occupations whether the potential jurors 401ks or stock investments had declined since 2007 whether they owned ereaders like Kindles and whether they played the lotteryIn the trial of Michael Jacksons physician jurors in California were asked whether they had had a doctor refuse to prescribe medication that they had requested In the trial of the Boston mobster James J Whitey Bulger questions included whether marijuana sales should be legal and the name of the last book each juror had readJudges have the discretion to permit or deny the use of a questionnaire lawyers and jury consultants say that judges are more likely to allow them when the prosecution and defense make a joint request for one and have collaborated on the questionsSome of the questions are basic covering employment potential hardship in case of a long trial and specific knowledge of the case at hand Then there are the more obscure questionsFor instance to get useful answers  particularly about opinions that may be socially unacceptable  consultants and lawyers dance around the issuesYou need to make it OK to express a bias said Leslie Ellis a senior consultant with TrialGraphix Posing a question like Lots of people feel this way how many would agree with that or asking openended questions is a way to get that information she saidIt is also important to write broad questions Dr Ellis said In a patent case she said you can ask a very specific question How many people here have ever applied for a patent trademark or copyright protectionOr she added you can ask how many people feel like theyve invented something or created something from scratch That will cast a broader net and turn up possible affiliationsBecause it is up to the judge whether to allow a questionnaire in the first place along with what may be asked questions cannot be too far afield consultants saidAnd because both sides can strike jurors from panels consultants and lawyers are trying to find jurors who might align with them without making that alignment obvious to the oppositionTheres an art associated with designing questions that elicit enough of what you want to know without going too far Dr Anthony said For example if youre a defendant you might not want a question along the lines of Do you believe too much money is awarded in the court system Because people who say absolutely are in the minds of both sides defenseoriented so all youre doing is highlighting the people who the plaintiff may want to strikeLawyers can use questionnaires to expose jurors opinions and see if what they say in court lines up with what they wrote as a recent Brooklyn trial showedRonell Wilson had already been found guilty of killing two police officers and for this part of the trial jurors had to decide whether he would receive the death penalty They filled out an 80item questionnaire with questions about religious backgrounds whether relatives were psychologists and views on the death penaltyIn court Mr Wilsons lawyers successfully got one juror removed for cause because his questionnaire answer I dont believe in the death penalty contrasted with his incourt answer in which he had discussed how the death penalty could be applied They successfully eliminated another juror who wrote that he could set aside his opinions on law enforcement although his brotherinlaw and nephew were both correction officersBut the judge did not grant Mr Wilsons lawyers request to strike a juror whose questionnaire was acceptable but whose affect was off The juror appeared to be laughing during voir dire The prosecution which wanted to keep the juror described it as nervous laughterBeyond questionnaires consultants and lawyers study how jurors interact with the judge and with one another If for example a bluecollar worker puts on a suit for court it suggests respect for the court system Dr Ellis said which could translate to a proprosecution stance in a criminal caseOr if someone is charismatic and authoritative you want to be certain that person is on your side said Roy Futterman a director at Doar Litigation Consulting If that person goes a certain way hes taking everyone with him he saidStill some lawyers seem disdainful of all the analysisI look at it much less scientifically said Susan Kellman a longtime New York defense lawyer Her favorite question is a simple listeningskills one Tell me one person whos dead who we all know and respectMost jurors say my grandmother she said and  unless that grandmother is Golda Meir  that tells her all she needs to know she addedThey dont follow directions she said Youre learning a lot from listening to people more than tests,2014-08-21T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/travel/to-ride-again-another-day-in-colorado.html,If you ride a bicycle more than casually you probably already know about Boulder Colo Its altitude endless hills and nearly perpetual sunshine make it a big draw for the pedalpowered and regularly ensure it a top spot on lists of Americas most bikefriendly citiesBut unless you live in Boulder you probably dont know about the ultimate day ride out of town Its a ride that morphs from calm easy pedaling to quadricepbusting difficulty proceeds upward through spectacular scenery and rewards you at the top with a dusty hamlet called Ward whose citizens hope you turn around and head home ASAP When I lived in Boulder I usually made the trip once a yearThe specialness of the ride to Ward lies in a set of connected felicities Its just long enough at 20 miles each way to take a satisfying chunk out of a day and still leave you an evening to brag about your exploits The long fairly taxing climb of 4000 vertical feet with a sudden sadistic kickup into an especially steep grade for the last mile or so means that your athleticism will be tested but within limits A winding stream accompanies you the most of the way up and the scarcity of cars on the route allows you to sink into yourself and enter into a trance of repetitive exerciseThen theres your destination the wonderfully strange improbable town of WardIn June I had a chance to revisit that climb for a host of difficult reasons Among other things the trip gave me a chance to assess the state of Boulders cycling health in light of the cataclysmic rains of September 2013 that flooded the Front Range blocking access to mountain hamlets like Ward for months and forever altering the face of the areaI had climbed to Ward just a few weeks before that historic downpour during a visit from my new home in Brooklyn On a mild sultry morning in late August blissfully unaware of the impending storms I had set out on the climb accompanied by my good friend Kip Hunter a Boulder native At my request we embarked on the steeper of the two approaches to Ward Were both 50somethings but very physically fit versions of that demographic and proud of itMy first lesson of the day wasnt long in coming and it was this You cant live away from Boulder for a couple of years at sea level as I had and suddenly return to 6000feet elevation without paying a price The first hill which I used to whisk up with a serious though never killing effort now seemed huge and the grade mercilessSerious uphill cycling is always a minuet of pain and pleasure On the Ward climb the steeper grades are usually followed by shallower gentler slopes allowing screaming legs a respite and the inflight entertainment of the scenery takes some of the sting out of the uphill slog I soon passed the charming twig tenement of a beaver dam in the roadside stream Not long after I saw a pair of amorous cardinals tussling in a nearby tree Mountain bluebirds flashed their electric colors in the bushes and the high desert air was bonedry and pleasantly scented with pineLulled by how good I was feeling I proceeded to mistake No 2 forgetting to pace myself As Kip ground steadily upward in a low gear I downshifted and shot forward ignoring my lack of acclimation to the altitude Everything was perfect until a kind of red fog entered my brain my legs stopped obeying my commands and the next thing I knew I was pulled off to the side of the road dryheaving over my handlebarsFailure in front of passing cyclists and my old friend Kip who had meanwhile vanished into the distance shouting something about the tortoise and the hare was not an option Gingerly I got back on my rental bike and limped up the last mile or so on the steep 10 percent grade into WardSituated about 9500 feet above sea level this mountain village of 200 is celebrated for its gnarly offthegridness its rusting old American cars parked on the sides of the road as tourist scarecrows and its oneway signs all turned outward to discourage entry to the city limits The one business in town is the tiny Utica Street Market where before the effortless glide back down I bought and slowly drank my reward for the climb the most delicious bottle of cold water on earthI returned to my home in Brooklyn a few days later burdened by a new sense of the limits of my habitual New York rides The Prospect Park 335mile loop that until my Boulder trip had seemed perfectly reasonable now felt foreshortened and dull Even the magisterial sixmileplus Central Park loop had mysteriously become boring and repetitious After a few days of cycling the old routes I was beginning to forget my newfound feelings of deprivation when a friend from Boulder emailed me that a heavy rain had begun falling there and wasnt letting upI say rain It was more the equivalent of a highpressure fire hose trained on the city Boulder denizens are used to heavy weather of course The town is pressed flush against the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and exposed to nature at its most elemental with giant skies and three or four Houdiniquick changes of weather in a day But this was another thing entirely a deluge a biblical plague a thousandyear flood the biggest monthly rainfall in recorded historyOver the fiveday downpour totaling almost 20 inches the storm concentrated on Boulder though it fell heavily in surrounding areas as well streets became lakes bridges were carried off cars were sucked into raging torrents houses were flung about like playing cards and many mountain communities simply swept awayBoulder was marooned in a new world of fallen water and the very thing that had turned it into a biking mecca  its glorious canyon climbs  now rendered it helpless when upriver dams burst and sent 30foothigh battering rams of debris roaring into the heart of the city The effects were devastating In several cases they were also fatalThe drama of all this was so consuming to a former resident me that it wasnt until late in the game that I woke up to my own stake in things I say woke up because thats literally what happened one day at 3 am when I bolted out of bed and flew to the computer where I clicked through a few links and slumped in my chair with a groanUpon moving away from Boulder two years earlier I had put all of my recently deceased fathers rarebook collection in storage The facility was in a town called Longmont about a dozen miles away I had chosen this facility after being assured by the owner that it was well outside the hundredyear flood plain The collection comprised thousands of books dating back to the 16th century and included many scientific and literary rarities Serious collectors have a relationship with objects that stops just short of the familial the physically embodied Insofar as it was possible these books were  my beloved fatherOn the computer screen was an image of the storage facility It appeared to be almost entirely underwaterIn the days that followed there was no access to the building and it was unclear how much damage the books had suffered But it wasnt only the fate of my fathers legacy that I obsessed about It was the city of Boulder as well In Boulder I had fallen in love and raised a family and in the citys canyons I had discovered a passion for cycling that became a lifeline pulling me through the deaths of both parents and the eventual crash of my marriage Two thousand miles away I felt protective of the fragile ecosystem of roads trails and paths that had made such a thing possibleSo in June I flew back to Boulder to take stock of my dads books revisit stormbattered friends and family and assess the state of the citys cycling culture Was the pedalpushing magic still alive and wellBoulder reveals itself dramatically to those approaching it on the main access road of Route 36 emerging as if from a whirl of a magicians cape when one crests a rise to see the city set out on the plain From a distance everything looked normal and as I entered the town at dusk that normalcy seemed borne out The formerly submerged downtown showed no obvious signs of devastation The only visible clue of a changed city was the earthmoving machinery parked on side streets Over the previous months those machines had moved many many tons of dirt and rocksThe next morning eager to assess the state of things firsthand I stopped at University Bicycles Living up to its reputation as the busiest bike store on earth per square foot the store was jammed  an indication that cycling enthusiasm at least had returned to preflood levels If anything the staff members seemed more buzzed and happy than ever Whether this was the result of their own athletic activity or a side effect of the many new legal marijuana dispensaries in the area was unclear I rented a lightweight model and pedaled out onto busy Pearl StreetHaving completed a casual reconnaissance of Boulders downtown which appeared unchanged from the storm I moved out of the city center It was then while taking some of the uphill grades to the canyons that I began to note the real differences Was I having a senior moment or wasnt that gap formerly filled with trees Werent there once park benches there Wasnt there once a high brick wall rising alongside the road and didnt the road itself once have a shoulderIn the words of Mike Patton director of Boulder Open Spaces and Mountain Parks a city agency You cant believe it till you see it The water tossed this city around like clothes in a rinse cycle There are canyons and Im talking canyons where there didnt used to be before the flood Fiftyfoot alluvial fans with Volkswagensized boulders for people to climb on Forests of twofootwide pine trees still laying on their sideLater that day I enlisted Kip and we rode the Boulder Bike Path a jewel of urban engineering whose 300 coiling miles extend from the city center to the hinterlands After the flood this entire area looked like a Rocky Mountain Pompeii Kip said as we pedaled along the smooth concrete of the path All around us the same mysterious forces of subtraction had been at work The canopy of shade trees that had fringed the path was gone Debris fields sat in the middle of former meadows In deference to my silverlining tendencies Id like to say all this was an improvement somehow It was notIn fact as feared many of the former canyons I had relished climbing in the area either were impassable or their formerly smoothly graded roadbeds were filled with dirt and gravel patches rendering them useless to road bike riders The climb to Ward at least was back in business but most serious cyclists had been forced to areas east and south of the city for their rolling sustenanceWeve had to get creative said Justin Green a Boulder sports physician and competitive mountain bike racer Cyclists love their routines but the flood forced us into expanding into whole new areas and trails we barely knew beforeIt may be a changed world for Front Range riders but it is impossible to ignore the signs of revival and ongoing bikelove in the air The next day I sat in the infield of the Boulder Valley Velodrome a new oval outdoor track in the town of Erie about 15 miles north of Denver which is still in the betatesting phase Doug Emerson one of its owners he also owns University Bicycles told me that he had started out 30 years earlier with 15 bikes and a toolboxYes he said smiling as brightly kitted riders whirred around us and if youd told me then that this town would one day have thousands of recreational cyclists with 10000 bikes in their garages Id have laughed in your faceOn the streets outside the velodrome the crush of cyclists out for a spin on expensive bikes seemed to prove his point Again and again as I continued to ride over the next few days I heard the same refrain Cycling recovery in the floodravaged parts of the state is a work in progress but the spirit of the sporting community is unbowed As John Hickenlooper the governor and an avid recreational athlete put it Cycling is about never quitting just when you think you might have nothing left to give you find you can give a little more and finish Well keep coming together and well keep pedalingOn my last night in Boulder over dinner at the reliably delicious Brasserie 1010 Kip took up the same theme This whole tragedy has had some unexpected positive side effects he said Bikers pitched in heavily to fund recovery efforts in the mountain towns they loved riding to and the wary locals up there began looking at them with a new respect Everybody lost and then everybody wonPoint taken Roads can be rebuilt Peoples hearts can be opened in unexpected ways by adversity But old books once ruined by water cannot absent huge expense be brought back to life I lost an entire first edition of the works of Joseph Conrad and about 20 percent of my fathers collection despite the best efforts of my exwife and stepchildren to salvage what they could Im not happy about it but Im not shattered by it either I try to take the long view and see it as an entry in the ledger of Necessary Expenses in Life If Boulder ate some books of mine it gave me back something far greater in the long run a lifelong passion for climbing on two wheels,2014-09-07T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/06/25/us/ap-us-rethinking-pot-police-pot-storage.html,DENVER   Police in some medical marijuana states who once routinely seized illegal pot plants by ripping them out by their roots and stashing them away in musty evidence rooms to die are now thinking twice about the practiceFrom Colorado and Washington state to California and Hawaii police are being sued by people who want their marijuana back after prosecutors chose not to charge them or they were acquittedIn some cases the onetime suspects are asking for hundreds of thousands of dollars to replace dead plantsConcerns over liability have prompted some agencies to either forgo roundingup the plants altogether or to improvise by collecting a few samples and photographing the rest to use as evidence for criminal chargesNone of us really are sure what were supposed to do and so you err on the side of caution said Mitch Barker executive director of the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police ChiefsThe change comes as the notion of marijuana as medicine clashes with police seizure procedure that was developed in an era when pot was a scourge that needed to be wiped outLaw enforcement is going to have to think more carefully about what their procedures are and how those procedures might need to change in light of changes in the law said Sam Kamin a University of Denver law professorJust as the smell of pot smoke may no longer be grounds to search a home or make an arrest Kamin who helped craft the states pot regulations said the same evidence that two or three years ago would have given police probable cause today doesntMost local police say they are seizing less weed postlegalization but they still investigate if they suspect patients are growing more than they should Federal agents face no such quandary since pot remains illegal under federal lawWhether or not state laws require as they do in Colorado police to return medical marijuana intact if a suspect isnt charged or is acquitted departments have been sued over pot that has wilted in their evidence lockersIn Colorado Springs a cancer patient who had faced drug charges is suing police after 55 dead plants were returned to him The state appeals court had to order the police to return themMedical dispensary owner Alvida Hillery sued police to return her 604 pot plants or pay 33 million after she was acquitted of drugcultivation charges She dropped the suit in exchange for a city dispensary license By then the plants had diedWe need uniform rules and law enforcement would be wise to develop those rules otherwise they will continue to be sued said Hillerys attorney Sean McAllister who is representing another dispensary owner in a similar suit in federal courtCity patrol officers must now call a narcotics detective for advice if they believe they are in the presence of illegal weedIn Hawaii a group of medical marijuana patients who were never arrested sued in May after police seized 52 plants in a raid They want 5000 for each plant if theyve diedIn Oregon a narcotics task force takes only the number of plants necessary to bring a patient back into compliance with the law said Washington County Sheriffs Sgt Chris SchweigertTen years ago you had that many plants you just went in there and ripped them all out Now youve got to ask a few questions said Sgt David Oswalt who supervises the Grand Junction police evidence roomOswalts department tells officers who believe the questionable weed is legal for medical purposes to take clippings and leave the plants behind If not they can seize plants by the bundleLeaving plants behind carries obvious risks said Jim Gerhardt of the Colorado Drug Investigators AssociationIt would be like arresting a cocaine dealer and taking a minuscule amount of the cocaine as a sample and then leaving it there for them to be used or sold he said Its a complicated messy issueWashington state does not require police to return plants to acquitted patients The states medical marijuana law allows gardens of 45 plants or less though it doesnt expressly prohibit having multiple gardens on a single propertySeattle police destroy marijuana plants after seizing them documenting the hauls with photographs or samples that can be presented at trial if necessary said police spokeswoman Renee WittThis month they seized more than 2200 marijuana plants but arrested no one in a raid of a purported medical marijuana operationMy God we would run out of space if we had to preserve it water it light it Witt saidPolice in Lynnwood Washington no longer seize medical plants said Angelea Madsen who supervises the evidence unitOfficials last year returned 202 dead plants seized from a group of medical marijuana patients who were

in to the government agreeing to the largest single federal settlement in the history of corporate America DealBooks Ben Protess and Michael Corkery write The tentative deal  which would cost the bank more than 16 billion to settle investigations into its sale of toxic mortgage securities in the runup to the financial crisis  came together last week after an unexpected ruling in another Bank of America case that undercut the banks negotiating leverageOn July 30 within hours of Bank of America making a settlement offer that again failed to appease the Justice Department Judge Jed S Rakoff of the Federal District Court in Manhattan issued a ruling in a separate case ordering the bank to pay nearly 13 billion for selling defective loans Bank of America had previously lost that case at trial The banks top lawyers and executives appeared to recognize that another courtroom battle would be futile and extremely expensive And as the bank reeled from the decision Attorney General Eric H Holder Jr delivered a simple demand to the banks chief executive Brian T Moynihan Raise your offer or be sued the next day On the morning of July 31 a bank lawyer called to offer 9 billion in cash and more than 7 billion in socalled softdollar relief to consumers an offer that was within striking distance of the Justice Departments initial demands Despite the eyepopping penalty the deal would bring a measure of closure to the bank which has already paid tens of billions of dollars to settle lawsuits by private investors and regulators over its mortgage operations Mr Protess and Mr Corkery write The deal the banks largest remaining legal issue from the financial crisis would in turn accelerate Bank of Americas effort to return to the business of being a bankAlso on Wednesday Bank of America

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/16/us/ferguson-mo-michael-brown-and-darren-wilson-2-paths-to-a-fatal-encounter.html,FERGUSON Mo  Michael Brown let his 16th birthday come and go without bothering to apply for a drivers license There was no need his family said He preferred to walkIn Ferguson where Mr Brown was living with his grandmother he walked nearly everywhere on Canfield Drive where his grandmother kept a small apartment and several blocks away on the bustling commercial strip of West Florissant Avenue a fourlane road full of hair salons and cheap restaurants that is the de facto downtown of the neighborhoodIt was during one of Mr Browns walks down Canfield Drive one week ago when he would have an unlikely collision It involved Mr Brown a black teenager who seemed to have avoided most of the traps that dragged down many of his peers and a white police officer Darren Wilson with an admirable record When it was over Mr Brown was dead and Officer Wilson was facing an uncertain legal and professional futureChief Thomas Jackson of the Ferguson Police Department at a hastily called news conference on Friday morning revealed Officer Wilsons name for the first time He has been a police officer for about five years but Chief Jackson offered scant information about his life and workOfficer Wilson 28 who has roots in Texas has worked for almost three years in Ferguson an innerring suburb that has the feel of a place in transition One business strip has been spruced up with a historic Main Street feel with cheerful painted signs a wine bar and a frame shop The neighborhood where Mr Brown died is a less appealing pocket of town a twobedroom apartment in his grandmothers building goes for about 550 a monthBefore that Officer Wilson worked two years in the police department in Jennings a neighboring suburbHe lives a halfhour drive away in the town of Crestwood southwest of St Louis interviews and property records show About six months ago neighbors said Officer Wilson moved into a new house a fixedup ranch with a small pool in the back and a wicker love seat on the porch The mailbox rises from a tub of flowers and letters on red white and blue stars hung from the door spell out WelcomeRecords indicate that he was divorced last year and now lives there with Barbara Spradling also a police officer who has received an award for valor The two rarely mixed with neighbors or struck up casual conversation neighbors saidTwo middleaged women sat across the street from Officer Wilsons home on Friday one who gave her name only as Kathy was visiting her 93yearold grandmother who bought the house when it was built in 1958All of the neighbors will tell the same story she said People would just see him and wave and thats itOfficer Wilsons professional record suggests someone who has avoided trouble There has been no disciplinary action taken against him Chief Jackson said FridayIve known the officer for years and have every confidence in him Chief Jackson saidOfficer Wilson received a commendation for extraordinary effort in the line of duty in February Greg Kloeppel a lawyer for the union representing Ferguson police officers confirmed the commendation that Officer Wilson received but he declined to provide information about what kind of person the officer is or any details about his lifeOne neighbor said he knew Officer Wilson was on the Ferguson police force and figured out that he might be linked to the shooting of Mr Brown when police cars marked and unmarked started showing up in the neighborhood several days ago Then on Tuesday Officer Wilson began mowing his lawn but he did not finish said the neighbor who wore a faded Cardinals Tshirt and camouflage shorts It appears they left in a hurrySince then people have come to take the couples mail in and picked up their dogs but the two have not been seenI dont expect them to return the neighbor saidRon Gorski who lives on the block and was walking his English bulldog Darla told reporters that he did not know Officer Wilson but that his 15yearold grandson and his friends were allowed to swim in the officers pool When he finds out all this happened hell be shocked Mr Gorski saidHe said Mr Wilson cleared out days ago but we knew something was going on because police were going up and down the block for a few days nowTwenty miles away in Ferguson the Brown family said it was no closer to understanding the circumstances that led an unarmed 18yearold to be shot to death by a police officer in the middle of the dayThey were outraged that the Ferguson police on Friday released surveillance video and photos of Mr Brown apparently stealing cigarillos from a convenience store on West Florissant and shoving a clerk as he walked outWhatever happened in the store is irrelevant said Benjamin L Crump a lawyer for the familyHe added They are not trying to solve the murder they are trying to justify itThe family insisted that Mr Brown had no history of violence or aggression He had no adult arrest record according to the police who said they could not speak to whether he had been arrested as a juvenileAdministrators at the chaotic public high school he attended one of the worst in the state said he was quiet shy and a little awkward hardly one of the trouble kids of which there were plentyYoud sit in a house with him watching TV and hanging out and youd forget he was there said Tim Sneed 23 a close friend and neighbor He had not one enemy Ive never heard of him getting in one fightMr Brown was still a teenager He smoked marijuana with friends in the neighborhood they recalled and drank cans of Bud Light with them when he ducked away from the watchful eyes of his familyFinishing high school was an effort that required the push of his parents and extended family who scolded him on the days that he slept late and missed morning classesBut he was determined to avoid many of the missteps frequently taken by his peers He wasnt like all these cats out here selling drugs and having babies with different women Kathy Gary 22 a relative said earlier this week We tried so hard to keep him in school Sometimes hed skip classes and he needed a push But he wanted to do somethingLast Saturday the day Mr Brown died dawned sunny and warm around 80 degrees a typically hot August day in Missouri With a friend Dorian Johnson Mr Brown set out to West Florissant wearing a white Tshirt khaki shorts and a red Cardinals capAbout 10 minutes before noon they entered Ferguson Market and Liquor a rundown store with shelves lined with potato chips Boones Farm wine and tequilaMr Brown who was 6foot4 had an intimidating appearance  his friends nicknamed him Bodyguard because he was so tallAccording to the surveillance video Mr Brown approached the counter leaned over and grabbed a handful of Swisher Sweets then turned for the door He pushed a clerk who tried to stop him then left the storeAt 1151 am the police said someone called 911 to report a robberyAfter leaving Ferguson Market Mr Brown and Mr Johnson walked north on West Florissant passing a McDonalds a hairbraiding shop and a Chinese restaurant They turned right at the corner of Canfield Drive where a fence at the corner bears a sign We are watching to report suspicious activities or persons to Ferguson Police DeptSeveral blocks later at 1201 pm they were confronted by Officer Wilson while they continued down Canfield a quiet street that curves gently as it weaves through apartment buildings and onestory brick housesThey were stopped not because the police were looking for a robbery suspect Chief Jackson said Friday but because they were walking down the street blocking trafficDevin Stone 28 a friend of Mr Browns was home in his apartment at the time across the street from the place where the men were confronted by the policeSitting outside his building Mr Stone said he was jolted by the sound of two gunshots followed by several more in rapid succession The second series of shots sounded automatic he said They let it ripMr Stone ran outside and saw two police officers both white men standing near Mr Brown who was lying on his stomach his arms at his sides blood seeping from his head Another neighbor a woman who identified herself as a nurse was begging the officers to let her perform CPRThey refused Mr Stone said adding They didnt even check to see if he was breathingOn Friday speaking to reporters Chief Jackson said the shooting was absolutely devastating to Officer Wilson He never intended for any of this to happen,2014-08-16T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/10/business/international/eu-nations-counting-sex-and-drug-trades-toward-gdp.html,PARIS  As the spokesman for the National Association of Sex Clubs in Spain Jos Roca has fielded all sorts of offbeat inquiries But rarely has he been more flummoxed than when he received a call late last year from the government statistics agencyIn earnest tones a statistician asked him if he knew the average price of a session with a prostitute in Spain and the typical cost of a room at a Spanish brothelHe even asked stupid questions like how much energy is consumed by a club recalled Mr Roca whose Valenciabased group represents hundreds of socalled alternate clubs across SpainI thought it was a joke he said I was so incredulous that I asked them to send me an email to make sure it wasntThe questions were not a hoax but part of a new effort to measure the size of the Spanish economy As of September all European Union countries will be required to take fuller accounting of trade in sex drugs and other underground businesses as part of an overhaul of economic measurements by Eurostat the European statistics agencyThe point of counting everything including the wages of sin is to get a more accurate reading of each countrys gross domestic product Because GDP is such an important number  one that can sway national policies and make or break politicians  the European Union wants numbers better reflecting the economic environment Vincent Bourgeais a Eurostat spokesman saidWith European Union governments obliged to reduce debt as a percentage of their economies the changes are also expected to make growth rates from Spain to Sweden look better possibly also making debt ratios seem rosierOther measures besides vice will be recalibrated like research and development and charitable contributions Those measures are certain to pump up GDP figures much more than any gains registered from prostitution or cocaine productionStill accounting for prostitutes and heroin can add billions to an economy And as some countries try to dig out of the euro zones nearly fiveyear growth slump every little bit helpsAccording to my calculations prostitution generates about 20 billion euros or 27 billion in Spain each year Mr Roca said Spanish men often frequent clubs and theres a lot of tourism for example from French clients just over the borderMr Rocas number is close to the governments estimate that 18 billion is generated by the legal sex trade in Spain If that is added to GDP Mr Roca said of course Spain will benefitTechnically reporting blackmarket economic activity has long been required under European Union regulations But measuring the underground economy is hardly an exact science Only a handful of countries including the Netherlands Italy and Germany have even tried to fully complyThe European Unions new rules will require all 28 countries in the bloc to redouble their efforts even if it means questioning brothel owners or tallying tons of cocaine seized from drug dealersAgencies are able to gather information but it hasnt been particularly accurate because were talking about activities that people try to hide said Gian Paolo Oneto the director of national accounts at the Italian national statistics agency IstatThese rules say GDP should include everything even tomatoes grown in your backyard Mr Oneto added But sometimes we can only estimate it We cant go around counting the tomatoesBecause the math can be fuzzy economists have tended to be wary of such measurements Italy holds a place in the annals of creative accounting for il sorpasso or the overtake of 1987 when the government revalued GDP to include the blackmarket economy So large were the figures which included estimates of tax evasion and illegal workers that almost overnight Italy leapfrogged over Britain to become the worlds fifthlargest economyNow as Italy struggles to pull out of a recession and labors under one of the developed worlds biggest debt burdens it will start counting smuggled alcohol and tobacco Mr Oneto declined to make a forecast but he noted that Italys overall black market already accounted for 15 percent of the countrys 15 trillion economyStill Mr Oneto said his agency would not go so far as to include one of the biggest possible economic enhancers  business conducted by the Italian mob which is thought to generate around 180 billion in annual revenue equal to about 7 percent of Italys GDP The mafia is too difficult to pin down he saidFor most governments illicit activity may count for little more than a rounding error In the Netherlands known for its redlight districts and marijuana coffee shops such activity counts for 04 percent of GDPThe biggest boost to GDP figures will come from something with no titillation value a Eurostat revision allowing governments to count research and development as investments rather than costs Finland and Sweden hotbeds of hightech capitalism could increase the size of their economies by as much as 5 percent according to EurostatIn Italy Ireland Portugal and Spain which are struggling to overcome recessions GDP could increase by as much as 2 percent Eurostat estimates while Germany and France could see expansions of as much as 3 percent Britain might show a gain of 3 to 4 percent Eurostat saidBritains Office for National Statistics recently announced it would start counting vice for the first time in the countrys economy which is rebounding from a recession It has begun by going back five years in its recounting In 2009 the only year for which it has thus far done a tally prostitution and drugs including cocaine heroin cannabis Ecstasy and amphetamines added nearly 10 billion pounds or 17 billion to British GDP equivalent to 07 percentIn other countries the issue transcends numbersFrances statistics agency is refusing to include drugs and sex work out of concern that prostitution for example often stems from sexual slavery and should not be given the veneer of economic legitimacyFor some such moral arguments call into question the very concept of GDP a statistic whose value has been philosophically secondguessed by critics since at least the 1960s Robert F Kennedy speaking in 1968 during a run for the presidency took stock of the way America measured success and lamented that it counted everything except that which makes life worthwhileEven some economists who see value in GDP as a way to measure living standards nonetheless question the wisdom of trying to tally decadenceIf you think that drugs and prostitution are things that do not necessarily improve the quality of life in a country said Simon Tilford deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London then including them undermines GDP as measure of wellbeingBack in Valencia Mr Roca the sex club representative was suspicious that Spain would use the new data to gild its GDP for political purposes even as the nation slowly crawls out of a threeyear recessionStatistics agencies though say that whatever the improved ratios debt will not be easier to service because governments cannot collect taxes from illegal underground activityIn which case Mr Roca says he fails to see the point The whole thing he said is a huge stupidity,2014-07-10T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/us/detroit-area-man-convicted-of-murdering-woman-who-knocked-on-his-door.html,DETROIT   No one disputed that in the early morning hours of Nov 2 Renisha McBride 19 stood on the front porch of a bungalow in suburban Dearborn Heights Mich She pounded at the door with her hands moving to the side of the house and back to the front Minutes later the homeowner a 55yearold airport maintenance worker named Theodore P Wafer who had been roused from his sleep opened the inside front door fired a single shotgun blast and killed herOn Thursday after less than two days of deliberation a Detroit jury decided that it was murderThe case has stirred racial tensions in Detroit  Ms McBride was black and Mr Wafer is white  and has drawn comparisons to the case of Trayvon Martin the Florida teenager who was fatally shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in 2012But where Mr Zimmerman successfully invoked selfdefense Mr Wafer failedMr Wafer was found guilty of seconddegree murder involuntary manslaughter and a felony weapons charge He could face life in prisonIn a cramped Detroit courtroom several family members of Ms McBride wept when they heard the verdict others gasped Mr Wafer stood and stared straight aheadMr Wafer who lived alone claimed selfdefense in the shooting testifying from the witness stand that he was asleep in his livingroom recliner about 430 am when he was jolted awake by violent pounding on his doors He was terrified he said and within minutes scrambled for his shotgun stashed in a closet believing that someone was trying to break into his home in Dearborn Heights just across the city line from DetroitI was upset he told the courtroom on Tuesday speaking in a soft even voice I had a lot of emotions I was scared I had fear I was panickingHis lawyer Cheryl Carpenter reminded the jury that Mr Wafer stayed inside his house during the shooting and was hardly looking for trouble that night Is this fun for you she asked himNo he said its a nightmareProsecutors countered that Mr Wafer had taken the law into his own hands failing to call the police and then shooting the unarmed Ms McBride without warning Her family who watched the courtroom proceedings with grim faces and frequent tears said that they believed Ms McBride must have been lost confused and seeking help after being hurt in a car crash several blocks awayAfter the verdict on Thursday Monica McBride Renisha McBrides mother said that she was astonished and relieved She had been hurt she said by what she saw as attempts by the defense to sully her daughters reputationWe know who she was Ms McBride said She was a regular teenager She wasnt violent Her life matteredWalter Simmons Renisha McBrides father said he did not believe race was a factor in her death I think he was mad and was ready for whomever came to his door he said of Mr WaferThe jurors declined to speak to reporters after the verdict was announced on Thursday afternoon Mr Wafer is to be sentenced on Aug 25During a twoweek trial jurors heard from 27 witnesses including Mr Wafer who described the events on the night Ms McBride was killed A friend of Ms McBrides testified that earlier in the evening the two drank vodka and smoked marijuana Just before 1 am Ms McBride hit a parked car within the Detroit city limits left the scene of the accident and rejected help from neighbors witnesses said One witness said that Ms McBride who appeared disoriented and was bleeding from her injuries brushed off a neighbors plea to wait for an ambulanceHer whereabouts for the next several hours remain a mystery But sometime around 430 am she approached Mr Wafers home a small house on a corner lot He testified that he was asleep in his living room when he heard loud pounding on the front door then on the side doorMr Wafer who has no landline phone said that he frantically searched for his cellphone but could not find it As the banging continued he said he went to a closet and retrieved his Mossberg 12gauge shotgun which he had loaded less than two weeks earlier after vandals had paintballed his vehicleOn the morning of Nov 2 Mr Wafer was so afraid that his house was about to be invaded he told the courtroom that he did not even peek through his vertical blinds to see who was outside concerned that he might give away his position within the houseHe opened his front door and seeing a figure said he fired one shot through the locked screen door killing Ms McBride Mr Wafer then found his cellphone and called 911 In a conversation only 18 seconds long he told the dispatcher that he had shot someone on his front porch who was banging on my doorMichigan law allows lethal force only if a person honestly and reasonably believes that it is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm Michigan also has a castle doctrine which states that there is no legal requirement for a person to retreat inside his or her homeRon Scott a community activist who has publicly supported the family stood outside the courtroom on Thursday and hailed the verdict as a victory for Detroit and its surrounding communitiesThe jury was made up of different races and from many bordering areas he said This shows we can get beyond separation,2014-08-08T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/us/jesse-ventura-chris-kyle-navy-seal-book-lawsuit.html,ST PAUL   Jesse Ventura the wrestlerturnedpoliticianturnedtelevisionhost has defied the odds before More than a decade and a half ago almost no one thought that a feather boawearing former professional wrestler could become the governor of Minnesota In Mr Venturas latest turn in the spotlight some people questioned whether he could prevail in a claim that he had been defamed in a bestselling book given the relatively high legal standard in such cases for public figures  and given Mr Venturas lifetime of vivid blunt and provocative pronouncementsYet on Tuesday a jury sided with Mr Ventura finding that he had been defamed calling for an award of more than 18 million and offering vindication to the former governor 63 whose old swagger seemed somewhat diminished during three tense weeks in court here At times the proceedings felt less like an examination of a book by a former member of the Navy SEALs than a retrospective of Mr Venturas history of colorful comments his reputation his lifeAs the verdict came in Mr Ventura was at his Minnesota home his lawyer said choosing not to appear at the federal courthouse here as he had during the trial He wanted me to express his sentiment that there are no real winners in this trial David B Olsen his lawyer told a throng of reporters Hes certainly grateful to the jury for their verdict but his reputation with an entire generation of young SEALs may never be repaired and thats why he says that theres no winner hereOver many years Mr Ventura has shown the world almost as many sides There was Jesse The Body the wrestling persona Jesse the actor in the 1987 Predator movie in which he uttered the line I aint got time to bleed And Jesse the blustery governor who pressed for tax cuts but may be better remembered for gleefully deriding reporters as jackalsAlong the way he wrote a stack of books led an unsuccessful legal challenge to the nations airport security procedures and hosted Conspiracy Theory on TruTV all the while mixing serious policy questions with a healthy dollop of showmanship At various points Jesse The Mouth another of his monikers has said he favored legalizing marijuana would no longer rise for the national anthem viewed organized religion as a sham and a crutch for weakminded people and described the country as the Fascist States of America Lately he spends part of each year in semiseclusion in Mexico and hosts a digital video show Off the GridThe lawsuit seemed to present a new side of Mr Ventura a somber man who said he had been wronged and who grew emotional even choked up while talking about his early years in a special Navy unit an underwater demolition teamIn 2012 Mr Ventura sued Chris Kyle the former Navy SEAL member saying that his book American Sniper The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in US Military History included passages about Mr Ventura that were false and defamatory The case thrust Mr Ventura long gone from the political scene in Minnesota back into a swirl of waiting news media a modest contingent of court watchers curious to see the former governor and at least one protester who appeared outside the courthouse at one point with an antiVentura signMr Ventura was not named in the book but was alluded to in a chapter called Punching Out Scruff Face about a confrontation with a celebrity inside a California bar in 2006 In interviews after the books release Mr Kyle said he was referring to Mr VenturaIn testimony Mr Ventura acknowledged that he had been inside the bar a place that was frequented by special Navy units like the SEALs but he denied claims that he had said the SEALs deserved to lose a few as Mr Kyle wrote Mr Kyle also wrote that he had punched Mr Ventura Mr Ventura said that never occurredMr Kyle was fatally shot in Texas last year after Mr Ventura filed suit but jurors saw a videotaped deposition from Mr Kyle who defended his writings After Mr Kyles death Mr Ventura continued the lawsuit pursuing Mr Kyles estate for which his widow Taya serves as executor Mr Ventura said he never would have gone to court had Mr Kyle admitted that he had made up the story of the bar fight and just apologized As it was Mr Ventura testified to jurors here a lawsuit was the only choice adding I was handcuffedThe jurys verdict was unusual for not being unanimous Eight jurors ultimately said they had agreed to a finding of defamation and unjust enrichment by the authors estate but two other jurors did not Such verdicts though relatively rare are permitted in federal civil casesIn the hours before the verdict was announced lawyers on both sides agreed to accept something short of a unified verdict without knowing which way the jury was leaning On Monday the fifth day of deliberation the jury had sent word to the judge that it did not believe it could agree to a single verdict so the lawyers began considering the possibility of a lessthanunanimous verdict while facing the likelihood of a deadlock that could have forced a new trialThat was a strategic call which seemed appropriate at the time John Borger a lawyer for Mr Kyles estate said after the verdict was announced Mr Borger said that his team would be evaluating all of our legal options in the weeks ahead and that a portion of the jurys finding  involving more than 13 million for unjust enrichment  requires additional consideration by the judgeDuring the trial Mr Ventura  still imposing at well over six feet tall and with his trademark bellowing voice looked smaller in court than he had as governor  slimmer and at points even subdued He spoke of bloodthinning medication he must take watched charts of his annual income flash on a large screen and described an entertainment career where the offers he said suddenly stopped It came to a screeching halt Mr Ventura testified attributing the diminished opportunities to Mr Kyles book which Clint Eastwood is making into a movie starring Bradley CooperLawyers for the authors estate though suggested that Mr Venturas popularity had simply faded over time They also suggested that Mr Ventura missed the attention that was lavished on him back in 1998 when he stunned the nation as a thirdparty candidate by beating two wellknown traditionalparty candidates to become governor here He served one term leaving office in 2003Mr Ventura dismissed the notion that he missed the limelight Over the years though he has flirted with suggestions that he may return to politics perhaps even in a presidential runI like the idea of waging war on the Democrats and Republicans he told Politico in 2013 suggesting Howard Stern as a wouldbe running mate Asked whether toying with a presidential bid was not merely the latest brand of publicity stunt for American celebrities Mr Ventura separated himself from the restNone of them have won he answered adding Jesse Ventura won Jesse Venturas the 38th

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/us/politics/left-and-libertarians-unite-to-amend-house-spending-bills.html,WASHINGTON   From abortion to electronic privacy to background checks for gun purchases a strange thing has been happening on the floor of the House as it debates its spending bills for the coming fiscal year the stirrings of liberalismThe House on Thursday voted 221 to 200 to approve an amendment by one of its most vocal liberal members Representative Rosa DeLauro Democrat of Connecticut to ban federal contracts for companies that set up sham headquarters in offshore tax havens like Bermuda Thirtyfour Republicans bucked their party to push it to passageThat was only the most recent stirring of life on the Houses left flank Democrats have long hoped they could find common cause on at least some issues with the Republican conferences libertarian wing That is starting to happen fueled by rising distrust of government on the right a willingness of Democrats to defy the Obama administration in some instances and a freewheeling amendment process on appropriations billsLawmakers involved in the legislating say their successes on the spending bills are not the result of luck or happenstance but of concerted outreach and negotiations As momentum builds those efforts could extend beyond routine spending bills to larger policy matters like overhauling mandatory prison sentencing laws reinstituting votingrights protections stripped away by the Supreme Court or pressing farreaching changes to intelligence and surveillance practicesIm very pleased that weve been able to get progressive amendments passed said Representative Nita M Lowey of New York the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee I wish we could do moreThe tally of leftlibertarian legislation is growing with the House at least on record voting to limit federal law enforcement actions intelligence efforts and social policy reach On May 30 49 Republicans crossed the aisle to approve language barring the federal government from raiding medical marijuana dispensariesSome people are suffering and if a doctor feels that he needs to prescribe something to alleviate that suffering it is immoral for this government to get in the way said Representative Dana Rohrabacher Republican of California once one of the chambers most ardent conservatives now a cosponsor of the marijuana measureThe day before 76 Republicans joined Democrats to add 195 million to the federal instant background check system for gun purchases The House Appropriations Committee has approved an amendment to allow Peace Corps volunteers who become pregnant by rape to have a federally funded abortion and another measure limiting the federal governments access to private email communicationsBy passing this amendment the Appropriations Committee is taking a critical step towards ensuring all Americans are protected by the Fourth Amendment  their mail documents on their desks at home and now their private emails said Representative Kevin Yoder Republican of Kansas and one of the measures authorsOn June 19 the House voted 293 to 123 to prohibit the National Security Agency and CIA from placing backdoor surveillance technologies on commercial technology products and to end warrantless collection of Americans online activities That amendment passed over the White Houses objections with a vetoproof margin was written by Representative Thomas Massie Republican of Kentucky and one of the Houses most outspoken libertarians with the Democratic Representatives Zoe Lofgren who represents Silicon Valley and Rush D Holt of New Jersey a physicistAn amendment by Representative Dave Reichert Republican of Washington reversed cuts to a Bill Clintonera program that funds local police forces a program long on the Republican target list The liberal Democrat that Republicans love to hate Representative Alan Grayson of Florida convinced just enough Republicans to pass an amendment blocking the Justice Department from compelling journalists to divulge confidential sources Another Democratic amendment clears a legal path for states to cultivate industrial hempTo be sure Republicans note plenty of amendments have driven spending bills to the right Just last week the House voted to block the Obama administrations efforts to combat climate change on multiple fronts including one amendment that prohibits any funding for any aspect of the administrations climate change agendaAmendments also have passed to end the deferring of deportations of immigrants brought illegally to the country as children to fund a Justice Department investigation of the Department of Homeland Securitys release of illegal immigrants and to block highspeed rail in CaliforniaBut Mr Massie said the libertarianliberal alliance is real and growing He said he has been working with Ms Lofgren on legislation that would repeal a federal law that makes it a felony to unlock a cellphone tied to a particular carrier even after a contract is expired Libertarians are also teaming with Democrats to change laws on federal mandatory minimum sentencingWe are working very hard to forge these coalitions Mr Massie saidThe Senate has not passed any of the dozen appropriations bills that Congress is supposed to do each year putting the fate of the Housepassed language in limbo More than likely House and Senate negotiators will meet after the November election to cobble together a giant bill to finance the government for the fiscal year that begins in OctoberAt that point with Democrats still in the Senate majority at least until January the liberal amendments passed by the House may have a better chance of surviving than conservative ones Democratic aides

Foster  are openly contemptuous of both parties Kennedy spent most of the Bill Clinton 90s as MTVs most vocal Republican but then she soured on the GOP a political shift that solidified during the spending and warring and moralizing excesses of the George W Bush years Sometime after the elephant tattoo on her left hip got infected and started looking more like a pig Kennedy began thinking of herself as a libertarian instead She Welch and Foster take turns on the show bashing not only Obamacare but also the NSA neoconservatives and social scolds Its not a hospitable forum for GOP talking points There are some libertarianleaning Republicans who are afraid to be on our show Kennedy told me Libertarianisms Nirvana a k a the former congressman and former presidential candidate Ron Paul has been on The Independents more than once But Pearl Jam  a k a Ron Pauls son Rand a oneterm Republican senator who may well run for the presidency in 2016  has yet to appearA few weeks after our conversation I saw Kennedy onstage in a hotel ballroom wearing purple spandex gyrating to the soundtrack of Flashdance and hollering into a microphone Are you hungry for more liberty She was the MC for the Competitive Enterprise Institutes annual dinner which as Welch put it to me in the tallestdwarf category is considered to be one of DCs best annual galas The CEI is a 30yearold organization that routinely sues federal agencies often when new and onerous regulations are posted in the Federal Register Tonights banquet had advertised itself as having an 80s theme and so several of the 800 attendees arrived dressed as pop icons of that decade After being introduced by Kennedy the institutes president Lawson Bader strode to the stage wearing the decidedly pre1980s Scottish formal attire of black jacket and kilt Announcing pending lawsuits against the Affordable Care Act and the NSA Bader thundered to righteous applause CEI will continue to push backBetween dinner courses Kennedy informed the audience that there was to be a contest with a prize awarded to the attendee who had recently flouted the most egregious law or regulation My tablemates  among them Welch a longtime member of the libertarian Cato Institute a French academic and a woman dressed as Cyndi Lauper  each scribbled their infraction on a piece of paper One had smoked a joint on the sidewalk with a stranger while another had traveled to Cuba without authorizationAt the nights conclusion Kennedy announced the winner It was a woman who despite her lack of veterinary certification had illegally massaged a pugLibertarians who long have relished their role as acerbic sideline critics of American political theater now find themselves and their movement thrust into the middle of it For decades their ideas have had serious backing financially most prominently by the Koch brothers one of whom David H ran as vice president on the 1980 Libertarian Party ticket intellectually by way of policy shops like the Cato Institute and CEI and in the media through platforms like Reason and as of last year The Independents But today for perhaps the first time the libertarian movement appears to have genuine political momentum on its side An estimated 54 percent of Americans now favor extending marriage rights to gay couples Decriminalizing marijuana has become a mainstream position while the drive to reduce sentences for minor drug offenders has led to the wondrous spectacle of Rick Perry  the governor of Texas where more inmates are executed than in any other state  telling a Washington audience You want to talk about real conservative governance Shut prisons down Save that money The appetite for foreign intervention is at low ebb with calls by Republicans to rein in federal profligacy now increasingly extending to the oncesacrosanct military budget And deep concern over government surveillance looms as one of the few bipartisan sentiments in Washington which is somewhat unanticipated given that the surveiller in chief the former constitutionallaw professor Barack Obama had been described in a 2008 Times OpEd by the legal commentator Jeffrey Rosen as potentially our first president who is a civil libertarianMeanwhile the age group most responsible for delivering Obama his two terms may well become a political wild card over time in large part because of its libertarian leanings Raised on the ad hoc communalism of the Internet disenchanted by the Iraq War reflexively tolerant of other lifestyles appalled by government intrusion into their private affairs and increasingly convinced that the Obama economy is rigged against them the millennials can no longer be regarded as faithful Democrats  and a recent poll confirmed that fully half of voters between ages 18 and 29 are unwedded to either party Obama has profoundly disappointed many of these voters by shying away from marijuana decriminalization by leading from behind on samesex marriage by trumping the Bush administration on illegalimmigrant deportations and by expanding Bushs NSA surveillance program As one 30yearold libertarian senior staff member on the Hill told me I think we expected this sort of thing from Bush But Obama seemed to be hip and in touch with my generation and then he goes and reads our emailsEarly polls show young voters favoring Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016 but their support could erode as they refamiliarize themselves with her just as it did in 2008 Clinton has been even slower than Obama to embrace progressive social causes while in foreign policy she associates herself more with her former Senate colleague John McCain than with noninterventionists Nor is Clinton likely to quell millennial fears about government surveillance Welch says Hillary isnt going to be any good on these issues She has an authoritarian mindset and has no interest in Edward Snowden whos a hero to a lot of these peopleAfter eight years out of the White House Republicans would seem well positioned to cast themselves as the fresh alternative though perhaps only if the party first reappraises stances that young voters in particular regard as outdated Emily Ekins a pollster for the Reason Foundation says Unlike with previous generations were seeing a newer dimension emerge where they agree with Democrats on social issues and on economic issues lean more to the right Its possible that Democrats will have to shift to the right on economic issues But the Republicans will definitely have to move to the left on social issues They just dont have the numbers otherwise A GOP more flexible on social issues might also appeal to another traditionally Democratic group with a libertarian tilt the hightech communities in Silicon Valley and elsewhere whose mounting disdain for taxes regulations and unions has become increasingly dissonant with their voting habitsHence the excitement about Rand Paul Its hardly surprising that Paul in Ekinss recent survey of millennial voters came out ahead of all other potential Republican presidential candidates on issues including samesex marriage surveillance and military intervention his positions more closely mirror those of young voters than those of the GOP establishment Pauls famous 13hour filibuster last year while ultimately failing to thwart the confirmation of the CIA director John Brennan lit afire the Twittersphere and compelled Republican leaders who previously dismissed Paul as a fringe character to add their own StandWithRand endorsements Paul has also gone to considerable lengths to court nonRepublican audiences like Berkeley students and the National Urban League In a presidential field that could include Cruz Jeb Bush Marco Rubio Chris Christie and Paul Ryan Paul  who has called himself libertarianish  is by far the candidate most associated with the movementIts nonetheless with some awkwardness that libertarians consider their sudden assimilation into the mainstream Partisan gunslingers like Glenn Beck have recently called themselves libertarians to the great annoyance of others in the movement When I asked Kennedy if some of these new libertarians were former ideologues now rebranding themselves so as to broaden their appeal she replied crisply Yes But she added that the idea of having a really specific litmus test is ridiculous Its just another form of groupthink Still even Rand Paul prompts notable skepticism among the diehards When he talks about Lets stop nationbuilding and lets start building bridges in Detroit a lot of libertarians roll their eyes Welch told me But hes done more to advance and popularize libertarian ideas in Washington than anyone else In terms of changing the national debate I think Rand has gone farther than his fatherDuring the fathers two runs for president as a Republican in 2008 and 2012 libertarian activists gave him momentum far beyond his popular appeal packing caucus halls and organizing rallies But its an open question whether these same activists will get off the sidelines and support his son whose libertarian bona fides are less sure but whose chance of victory is far greater And if they do its unclear whether GOP establishment figures can put aside their longtime distrust of libertarianism and welcome Pauls bid to expand the partys base If this is indeed the libertarian moment do either libertarians or Republicans intend to seize itOn the afternoon that I showed up to chat with the longtime libertarian writer and editor Nick Gillespie at the posh Washington offices of Reason just off Dupont Circle a dozen or so staff members were hanging out in the kitchen drinking Green Hat gin It is named in honor of George Cassiday a bootlegger who was known as the man in the green hat and who provided liquor to congressmen during Prohibition thus making it a quintessentially libertarian beverage Gillespie poured me a glass and led me to a sitting area beside his office which is festooned with vintage rock posters Nick Gillespie is to libertarianism what Lou Reed is to rock n roll the quintessence of its outlaw spirit He is 50 a former writer for teen and heavymetal magazines habitually garbed in black from head to toe wry and mournful in expression a tormented romantic who quotes Jack Kerouac For the past 20 years Gillespie has been a writer editor and intellectual godfather for Reason the movements leading journal since its founding in 1968 and which today has a circulation of about 50000 while its website receives 33 million visits a month By the standards of libertarianisms radical fringe Gillespie is fairly tame He prefers Federal Reserve currency over Bitcoin has no personal interest in owning a semiautomatic weapon and faithfully votes in presidential elections albeit for the Libertarian Party candidateHis embrace of libertarianism coincided with a rejection of party ideology and collectivist thinking As a graduate student during the 1980s and early 1990s at Temple and the State University of New York at Buffalo Gillespie encountered the politically correct tunnel vision of what he calls the professoriate which turned him away from liberalism for good At the same time Gillespie was unimpressed by Ronald Reagan who declared a new war on drugs raised the national drinking age to 21 raised all sorts of taxes preserved Social Security which Gillespie regards as federally mandated generational theft and in general claimed to champion American individualism while squashing it every chance he gotI was never conservative he told me as we sipped our gin Republicans always saw libertarians as nice to have around in case they wanted to score some weed and we always knew where there was a party And for a while it made sense to bunk up with them But after a while it would be like So if we agree on limited government how about opening the borders No thats crazy How about legalizing drugs How about giving gays equal rights No come on be serious And so I thought Theres nothing in this for meGillespie likes to point out that unlike the words Democrat and Republican libertarian should be seen as a modifier rather than a noun  an attitude not a fixed object A cynic might assert that this is exactly the kind of semantic copout that relegates Gillespies toocoolforschool sect to the margins Not surprisingly he begged to differ Its wedded to an epistemological humility he told me that proceeds from the assumption that we dont know as much as we think we do and so you have to be really cautious about policies that seek to completely reshape the world Its better to run trials and experiments as John Stuart Mill talked about The whole point of America  and this is an admixture of Saul Bellow and Heidegger and Jim Morrison lyrics  is that its in a constant state of becoming constantly changing and mongrelizing Were doing exactly what free minds and free markets allow you to do Part of why Im a libertarian is that if you restrict people less interesting stuff happensContinuing his riff with beatnik locomotion he added Its like what happens in garages Rock bands form in garages Computer companies And OK occasionally serial murders But as long as youre not just parking your car there garages are always interestingGillespie Kennedy and virtually every other libertarian leader I met told me that their philosophy was unique for its consistency And yet determining what it consistently looks like in practice can be a frustrating exercise Foreign policy is the easiest place to start With rare exceptions libertarian leaders have recently advocated staying out of Libya Syria Iran Iraq and Nigeria Informing their reluctance to intervene overseas is the recent experience of post911 neoconservatism Gillespie smirking told me Sarah Palin doesnt deserve credit for anything but she wasnt the only one who didnt understand what the Bush Doctrine meant And Obamas been as bad as Bush but with less of an excuse We dont have to pretend anymore that radical Islam is an existential threat to the West Its herpes but its not AIDS Its a chronic condition but it wont kill us Just keep the attacks to a minimum Gillespie and others maintain that theirs is a posture of restraint not isolationism But its an impulse reminiscent of Ron Paul who not only opposed both Iraq wars but has also stated that President Lincoln was imprudent in declaring war on the South Ben Domenech whose web magazine The Federalist frequently publishes commentators from the movement said Libertarians have not yet espoused a comprehensive view of the world that shares more in common with say Bob Gatess realism than it does with isolationismBeyond avoiding adventurism overseas defining the libertarian agenda gets even trickier Virtually all libertarians enthusiastically favor marijuana legalization but they become more subdued when the subject turns to cocaine and heroin They are united against most benefit programs but divided on whether to champion the outright abolition of Social Security Medicare and Medicaid On immigration policy the purist stance would call for completely open borders which Gillespie and a few others in the movement advocate though not quite literally and so down the slippery slope the ideal skids into a murky world of armed deportation agents and registration systems and random drug testing Libertarianleaning elected officials often say that there can be no open borders as long as the welfare state exists for immigrants to drain Gillespie is among those who consider this a dodgeThe socalled cultural issues have traditionally been a safe haven of libertarian concurrence and as well a showcase for the movement to demonstrate how it would apply laissezfaire principles to personal freedoms One of the more pugnacious advocates of this acrosstheboard approach is Cathy Reisenwitz a 28yearold Washingtonbased journalist who has a tattoo under her right biceps that reads I Own Me What does that mean I own myself  David Frum a former speechwriter for George W Bush and Republican commentator sputtered in exasperation when we spoke later Can I sell myself If I cant I dont own myself Reisenwitz a former staff member at Reason writes a blog called Sex and the State that she told me thoroughly disassociates culture wars from free markets  I disavow them 100 percent When I asked her where she stood on abortion Reisenwitz replied I do not support any legislative restrictions on health care She also espoused purity on samesex marriage telling me If youre going to say Government should be out of marriage and youre creating petitions and submitting bills awesome But in the meantime if government is going to be involved in marriage as an institution it should be available for everyoneBut libertarian consistency on even these social issues is in the eye of the beholder In 1968 Ayn Rand flatly declared An embryo has no rights    Abortion is a moral right Twenty years later however the Libertarian Party proffered as its presidential candidate Ron Paul an OBGYN who has argued that the movements bedrock nonaggression principle should apply above all to the most defenseless the unborn Today one of the more fluent antiabortion journalists is also a selfidentified libertarian Mollie Z Hemingway senior editor at The Federalist differs significantly from Reisenwitz on the subject of marriage on the basis of what Hemingway maintains are libertarian groundsEven acceptance of samesex marriage an ostensibly profreedom position that has become nearly nonnegotiable for younger voters is a stance that some selfdescribed libertarians will not sign onto When I asked Hemingway what she thought of extending rights to gay couples she replied carefully Well I have always thought that government should be so small that it doesnt have a role in giving benefits Its interesting to me that libertarians see government redefining the institution as something that will maximize liberty And I am very skeptical about that She added that while people should be free to organize their own lifestyle the state had a unique interest in protecting heterosexual marriage because it was the relationship thats ordered to producing childrenThis was a familiar point  but for social conservatives like Rick Santorum not for libertarians When I pressed her on it Hemingway said Do I think the state should change the definition of marriage to allow samesex couples I think people should be free to organize their own lives however they wish Im skeptical about the way were accomplishing this I dont know I feel like I need to think about it moreThis is not the first moment that libertarians have claimed as their own In 1971 The New York Times Magazine published on its cover a 5200word article by two young authors one of them was Louis Rossetto Jr later a founding publisher of Wired who pronounced libertarianism undoubtedly the fastestgrowing movement in the country That same year the Libertarian Party was formed a year later its 1972 presidential ticket of the philosophy professor John Hospers and the TV talkshow host Tonie Nathan received one electoral vote Forty years later little had changed The Libertarian Partys 2012 candidate Gary Johnson a former governor of New Mexico spent a million dollars and received more than a million votes  a better showing than any of his partys predecessors but not good enough to even remotely sway either the presidential election or the terms of the national debateWhy has the libertarian takeover not come to pass With charming understatement the authors of the 1971 magazine article pointed out a small complication to this otherwiseunstoppable tidal wave they predicted At present they wrote the only areas of disagreement within the libertarian movement are whether the movement should strive for anarchy or for limited government and whether it should work through revolution or within the system That tension has not gone away During my travels with libertarians I met many who cheerfully identified themselves to me as anarchocapitalists and I sat in on one speech  by Bill Buppert a blogger and the author of a book called ZeroGov  that featured applause lines like any tax rate above zero percent is immoral and there are no good cops out there I also encountered Beltway libertarians who revolt at the ballot box like Gene Healy a Cato Institute vice president who told me Usually I just vote for whoever the Libertarian Party throws up even if its a guy living in his carEven if libertarians willingly engage the political process theres little to guarantee that the process will engage them back Each party would be only too happy to receive the libertarian vote as long as it doesnt have to do much of anything to earn it But not since the days of the Vietnam War and Nixons imperial presidency have libertarians seen much profit in an alliance with the biggovernment Democrats Instead ever since a newly inaugurated President Reagan declared Government is the problem politically practical libertarians have been more apt to cast their lot with the GOPAnd yet the relationship between the libertarian movement and the Republican Party is a fraught one to say the least The GOPs traditional threelegged stool is propped up by not only libertarian advocates of free markets but also by hawks who believe in a wellfinanced and forwardleaning military and by social conservatives who believe that the government should play a role in preserving family values Neither of the other legs feels supported by libertarians and with cause Its hard to know whether Republicans in one or both of these other camps can ever make peace with a movement that they have spent a generation deriding In a 1997 Weekly Standard article titled The Libertarian Temptation David Frum belittled its followers as feckless hedonists who claim that snorting cocaine is some sort of fundamental human right When I recently asked Frum if his feelings toward libertarianism had mellowed he assured me that they had notIts a completely closed and airless ideological system that doesnt respond well to reality he said Libertarians are like Marxists in that they have prophets like von Mises and Hayek and they quote from their holy scripture and they dont have to engageIn practice whenever a Republican politician has behaved more like a libertarian than a party loyalist the party has made him pay for it Despite the fact that Ron Paul served nearly two decades in the House and established seniority on the Financial Services Committee in late 2010 the incoming speaker John Boehner reportedly sought to deny Paul a subcommittee chairmanship owing to Pauls views on monetary policy before eventually buckling to the outcries of Paul supporters On the House floor Paul typically sat with a fellow outcast the antiwar Republican Walter Jones During the GOP presidential primaries of 2008 and 2012 the other candidates treated him with amused derisionSince Paul vacated the Capitol the libertarian movements latest Republican congressional hero has been Justin Amash a 34yearold ArabAmerican and twoterm House member from Grand Rapids Mich whose office wall sports adjoining posters of Ayn Rand and Mickey Mouse Amash is the founder of the House Liberty Caucus consisting of about 30 libertarianinclined Republicans and occasional Democratic visitors like Jared Polis The caucus serves as a de facto competitor to the Houses conservative think tank the Republican Study Committee which Amash considers suspect in part because of its support for big military budgets Even by the standards of his 2010 Tea Party class GOP leaders have viewed Amash as the antithesis of a team player for voting against Republican budgets that in his view did not cut deeply enough and for siding with liberal Democrats to end the war in Afghanistan Last year Amash horrified military hawks and the intelligence community by introducing an amendment to defund the NSAs domestic phonesurveillance program which came within a dozen votes of passage Having already stripped the videogameobsessed congressman of his seat on the Budget Committee senior Republicans have now invested heavily in Amashs primary opponent in hopes of vaporizing his presence in Congress altogetherOne afternoon in late May I had lunch in Chinatown with Amash just a couple of hours after House Republican leaders gutted another of his antiNSA bills He nonetheless wore a defiant smile The public was on his side Amash said and not just Republicans  and for precisely this reason he added GOP leaders view us as a threat to the established orderStill the antiabortion and bordersecurityadvocating Amash is hardly a radical libertarian For the most part his views are inseparable from those of Rand Paul And so I asked him Given how leaders in your party have reacted to your legislative proposals how do you think theyre going to react if Paul runs for presidentI believe very strongly that he could be the nominee Amash said He just needs to get his message out there and push back against the caricature that some of the political establishment will make of Senator Paul Theyre doing it because theyre afraid of himWhyBecause Amash said Paul shared his ability to appeal to all kinds of people not just big donors and not just entrenched Republicans He destroys their system he said with a thin smileI think the war on drugs has had a disproportionate racial outcome Rand Paul said as he stood in his cowboy boots before a small gathering of Rotary Club members in Shelbyville Ky Three out of four people in prison are black or brown White people do drugs too but either they dont get caught or they have better attorneys or they dont live in poverty Its an inadvertent outcome and we ought to do something about it As a Christian I believe in redemption I believe in a second chance I think drugs are bad I think even marijuana is deleterious However a 20yearold kid who does make this mistake ought to get his right to vote back ought not to be locked up in jail for 10 or 15 yearsIt was not the kind of message that a Republican presidential aspirant typically delivers to an allwhite audience But as he continued with his offthecuff remarks I began to see what the Kentucky senator was up to After observing Were a procoal state and Im a procoal senator Paul then told the attendees but Im not for no regulations on coal even going so far as to suggest that todays environment was better than a century ago and some of thats through government regulation He assured the audience that he was all for affordable health care just not the Affordable Care Act  its really about freedom versus coercion And as his bedrock economic principle Paul said We can grow as a country but government needs to be minimized and the private market needs to be maximized But he was careful to say That doesnt mean no governmentDespite Amashs claim that Paul destroys their system nothing about his rhetoric sounded remotely worrisome to the Republican establishment At the same time the political artfulness of his oratory was hard to miss Rand Paul was roadtesting a kinder gentler libertarianism to a mass market  in effect triangulating to use the term associated with Bill Clinton whose moral lapses Paul frequently cites Republicans Democrats and libertarians It is a maneuver that if successful could amount to a considerable triumph for the movement By calling for significantly reduced sentences for drug offenders Paul has slyly redefined the terms of the marijuana debate with a libertarian tilt Though a selfproclaimed traditionalist on marriage his seeming contentment with judicial trends on the subject is far more in keeping with Democrats than with others in the GOP presidential field And if Pauls foreignpolicy addresses have more in common with the realism espoused by Robert Gates a former defense secretary than with his fathers laissezfaire approach to the outside world his worldview nonetheless marks a clear break from the hawkishness that still predominates within the Republican PartyThe hawks have taken notice Dick Cheney dusted off the word isolationism  which in foreignpolicyspeak is essentially a synonym for wildeyed extremism  in describing Pauls aversion to a renewed military presence in Iraq Rick Perry made a similar charge in a Washington Post oped titled Why Rand Paul Is Wrong on Iraq Senator John McCain has been particularly caustic saying that a Rand Paul foreign policy would constitute a dangerous retreat into a fortress America and dismissing Pauls drone filibuster as a stunt intended to fire up impressionable libertarian kids in college dorms Paul in turn has enthusiastically ripped into each denouncerI think that Senator Paul has been very clever in trying to couch his foreign policy in terms that would appeal to most Republicans said the conservative writer Ramesh Ponnuru who like David Frum has qualms about the libertarian movement But at the end of the day hes a hardcore antiinterventionist and Republican voters arent Ponnurus latter assertion will be tested in the 2016 primaries which could include in descending order of hawkishness Rubio Perry Cruz and then Paul with foreignpolicy stances by Christie Bush and others yet to be articulatedOver the past year Paul has drawn a great deal of attention as the only likely Republican presidential candidate to venture into the hostile territory of college campuses and Latino and AfricanAmerican groups Following the Rotary Club talk in Shelbyville I watched Paul dedicate a plaque to the memory of an AfricanAmerican doctor and civil rights activist An 89yearold black woman named Frances Marshall looked on with pronounced skepticism telling me Actions speak louder than wordsLess noticed is how Paul has taken pains to mollify the Republican base He reminds audiences like the one in Shelbyville that he is prolife His assaults on the Affordable Care Act are frequent Faced with criticisms that he is antiIsrael Paul three months ago introduced a bill he called the Stand With Israel Act in which the Palestinian government would not receive any further foreign aid unless it recognized Israel as a state It was complete pandering the libertarian Hill staff member told me Still the vitriol aimed at Paul by McCain Cheney and others in his party defies Reagans 11th Commandment  Thou shalt not speak ill of thy fellow Republican  and harks back to the enduring animus between hawks and libertariansI asked Reince Priebus the chairman of the Republican National Committee what he made of this rift I think most people share my view about Rand as being purehearted in his views and intentions he replied diplomatically I just think he has some different opinions that not everyone shares Theres going to be disagreements within our party Look at how the Democrats are lambasting the president over his pathetic approach to the border Look if Rand Paul was such an outsider I wouldnt have him speaking at three of our national events I see Rand Paul as someone who will build a lot of bridges in our party Last year he and I did a listening session with libertarians in New Hampshire Libertarianism is certainly growing in the country and I think its an opportunity for the Republican Party to grow as well And I see our party as being very welcoming to the libertarian movement and to Rand Paul That doesnt mean you wont have disputesLast month I dropped by the Russell Senate Office Building to talk to Paul about his libertarianRepublican tightrope walk Paul 51 and a native Texan possesses a supple mind and is a preternaturally confident speaker for someone who has held office for only four years At the same time Paul is not particularly enthusiastic about the gladhanding niceties that come with the job Good to see you he mumbled then flopped down into a chair in his offices conference room and fixed me with an impatient stare I got to the point Were we living in a libertarian moment or was that wishful thinking on the part of Nick Gillespie and othersI think a plurality of Americans dont consider themselves to be either Republicans or Democrats Paul said citing young people and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs in particular I also think there was a time maybe 30 years ago when libertarian was a term that scared people Now I think it seems more like a moderate point of view So I think the term is something that is definitely attracting not repelling peoplePaul qualified that observation by noting that the word itself encompassed a spectrum of positions What I try to point out when people say Oh youre an isolationist I say No theres two poles One is that were nowhere any of the time the other is were everywhere all the time Right now were much closer to the latter extreme pole  and thats also coming from my party the neoconservatives So really libertarianism might be more like foreignpolicy realism There may be some libertarians who say By golly were not going anywhere unless they attack us I think I consider myself to be more moderate on the foreignpolicy spectrumDo you think some political forces in Washington like big defense contractors hear your views on the defense budget and regard you as an existential threat I askedI dont think you should ever make a decision on what weapons systems we use based on the bottom line of those who make the weapons systems he said That makes some people fearful Grinning he added But it should make other people feel hopefulDuring our conversation Paul made a point of characterizing libertarianism as being moderate rather than liberal on social issues Movement leaders would likely object but Pauls preoccupation is with swaying the centerrightThe party cant become the opposite of what it is he told me If you tell people from Alabama Mississippi or Georgia You know what guys weve been wrong and were gonna be the progaymarriage party theyre either gonna stay home or  I mean many of these people joined the Republican Party because of these social issues So I dont think we can completely flip But can we become to use the overused term a bigger tent I think we can and can agree to disagree on a lot of these issues I think the party will evolve Itll either continue to lose or itll become a bigger place where theres a mixture of opinionsIn effect Paul was saying that the way for Republicans to win was to become more libertarian  though only up to a point Purity was the movements game not his Paul reminded me that he worked on his fathers 1988 Libertarian Party presidential campaign and felt a great deal of sympathy for anyone trying to take on the major parties I also gathered signatures to get him on the ballot he said I know what a thankless job that is Anybody who stands in a parking lot is thought to be an extremistBut later with an irritated edge to his voice Paul added Some people are purists and I get grief all the time  all these libertarian websites hating on me because Im not as pure as my dad And Im putting restrictions on foreign aid instead of eliminating foreign aid altogether And Im like Look guys Im having trouble putting these restrictions on much less eliminating them So give me a break This June I watched Nick Gillespie deliver the keynote address at PorcFest the annual libertarian outdoor festival held in Lancaster NH and named for the areas ubiquitous porcupine About 500 campers sat attentively while several others stood off to the side HulaHooping as they listened Arrayed before Gillespie were several boxes of exotically flavored PopTarts that he had purchased at the Lancaster grocery store He held them up as evidence that individualism was flourishing and choices were in abundance or as he put it The libertarian moment is now Their moment had arrived Gillespie said because the main political drivers have destroyed their credibility Only the dead think the GOP is the party of small government At the same time he added the Democrats had a clean shot to demonstrate that theyd protect our liberties and they proved themselves to be utter fraudsWith deadpan aplomb Gillespie then said If we can have 20 different types of PopTarts maybe we can have more than two types of political identificationAfter the speech was over and Gillespie gamely posed for a few pictures with admirers I cornered him and asked him if he was suggesting that libertarians leave the GOPflavored PopTarts on the shelf Gillespie said it all depended on Republicans This is the fundamental question for the Republican Party he said Are they going to embrace the libertarian elements of Rand Paul and Justin Amash Because thats their only way out Theyre at 25 percent selfidentification and its not going to climb back up if they keep reelecting the old horses Libertarians dont need them Were already alienated and out of the mainstream We dont need the Republican Party in the way that they need the energy and the vision of libertariansBut I wanted to know would libertarians be willing to meet the GOP somewhere in the middle Among the 1700 or so attendees I had seen guns and Bitcoins and slogans like Liberty Too Big to Fail and I Do Not Consent to Searches What I had not seen or heard was any show of support for Rand Paul The crowd here at PorcFest many of them young all of them passionate represented just the sort of army that Paul would need in the early primary states and beyond  the same sort of army in fact that powered his fathers improbable showing in previous elections But they still talked more about the father than the sonGillespie acknowledged that the answer remained unclear I think that if a majorparty candidate articulates 75 percent of the catechism he said both selfidentified libertarians and people who dont realize theyre libertarians would vote for him But then again he said it might take a hundred years or something for his movement to find its true expression in a political party Weve gone from a movement that didnt exist then we all believe in this roughly similar thing then we have a dalliance with the GOP then we realize no were totally separate And then we find out no we really need to activate politically in a conventional twoparty system he said his tone betraying little concern for the pace of this process And it may be were still some years away from that I dont knowOur libertarian moment in other words might very well pass unexploited But it remained for Gillespie and his fellow travelers a moment to savor PopTarts washed down with Green Hat gin Interesting stuff was happening in the garage called America and you could try to change the system or you could also elect to be boring Either way you were at perfect liberty,2014-08-10T00:00:00Z,drugs

not to be wholly trusted since what they say always shimmies between truth and fiction For theatergoers who are tired of the clearcut eithers and ors of most mainstream play writing Between Riverside and Crazy which opened Thursday night in a deliciously mounted Atlantic Theater Company production is a dizzying and exciting place to beTo help orient  or disorient  you allow me to describe the elements of what may be the sexiest scene on a New York stage this summer which takes place in the plays second act They are a battered old man in a wheelchair an amplebodied dogooder identified in the program only as Church Lady and a communion wafer To reveal much more would spoil what is a uh lovely surprise But I can disclose that baptism and orgasm are not mutually exclusiveBlurring lines between the sacred and profane has always been a specialty of Mr Guirgis whose earlier tales of lives on the margins had telling titles like Jesus Hopped the A Train Our Lady of 121st Street and The Last Days of Judas Iscariot Staged between 2000 and 2005 by the Labyrinth Theater Company these works brimmed with original verve But they also stripped gears as they shifted between confrontational harshness and soft sentimentalityAny such wrenching awkwardness had disappeared by the time Mr Guirgis made his Broadway debut in 2011 with his The ____________ With the Hat Unprintable language is another specialty of Mr Guirgis A portrait of treacherous relationships among recovering addicts starring Bobby Cannavale and Chris Rock Hat blended what we usually think of as good and bad beautiful and ugly funny and serious into one utterly fluid concoctionBetween Riverside and Crazy which features a superb cast led by Stephen McKinley Henderson and directed by Austin Pendleton shows no signs of backsliding by its author Its as fresh and startling as Hat but in a slyer quieter vein Hat was a volcanic chain of eruptions Riverside creeps up on you And every time you think youve figured out where its going Mr Guirgis alters its course forcing you to readjust your emotional bearings and your take on its charactersWhen it begins Riverside could almost be mistaken for a raunchy latterday descendant of a 1970s sitcom like Sanford and Son or All in the Family Two men of different generations are eating breakfast and butting heads The older guy Walter Washington Mr Henderson in a deceptively easygoing impeccably measured performance is even called Pops and he has no use for the fancy fractured dietary wisdom spouted by the younger man Oswaldo Victor AlmanzarRadiating a relaxed warmth and feistiness this scene also implicitly defines the plays boundaries or to be exact the idea that its boundaries are highly flexible Pops who grows weary of Oswaldos telling him he should change his eating habits because of what they say about nutrition these days declares They always saying something aint they And mostly in the end they said always end up completely assbackwards from what they originally saidThe same observation might be applied to the people in Riverside who are always true to character but seldom true to type or to their avowed principles Morality love and friendship exist on a contingency basis for Pops a retired policeman whose wife died not long before the play begins and his extended family and friendsThat includes Junior Ray Anthony Thomas Pops jailbird son who retains an adolescents sullenness with his dad Juniors luscious scatterbrained girlfriend Lulu Rosal Coln and Juniors pal Oswaldo who has father issues of his own and has claimed Pops as an embracing paternal substituteThey all share an enviably spacious rentcontrolled apartment on Riverside Drive in Manhattan Popss tenancy is being contested by his landlords but the old guy aint budging Walt Spanglers precisely detailed fully dimensional revolving set helps us understand why Nor is Pops about to back down on the matter of the lawsuit he filed eight years ago after being shot while off duty and out of uniform by another copIts not just the landlords who want Pops to move on His former squad partner Detective OConnor Elizabeth Canavan and her fianc Lieutenant Caro Michael Rispoli of The Sopranos drop in with sensible but unwanted legal advice As for that aforementioned Church Lady a gaspmaking Liza ColnZayas she comes bearing the promise of freedom from care and strife through the LordDirected by Mr Pendleton with an authoritative finesse that leaves plenty of interpretive breathing room the cast achieves the tricky task of creating characters who are both utterly believable and not to be believed for a second Riverside traffics in paradoxes which is to say it deals with the walking contradictions that are human beingsThese people on some level believe in exactly what they say as they say it But feelings have a way of changing facts dont they As in Hat Mr Guirgis makes it clear that any rules for human behavior are at best provisionalThats equally true whether its the selfhelp babble that Oswaldo has picked up from his social worker and support groups or the smooth but coercive ofthepeople patter spouted by Lieutenant Caro or the cometoJesus murmurings of the seductive Church Lady Mr Guirgis has a splendid ear for these various languages of deception and might even argue that all language is a form of deceptionTalk is cheap but its also dear because its what gives order to confusion and allows people to create a public image that they can live with That doesnt mean that theyre entirely selfdeluded and dont make the mistake of accepting them at their own expressed valuationAs the marijuanaglazed bimboesque Lulu says in a jolting flash of insight I may look how I look but that dont mean I am how I look On Riverside those are words to live by,2014-08-01T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/29/nyregion/brooklyn-judge-acts-to-undo-long-sentence-for-francois-holloway-he-had-to-impose.html,Francois Holloway has spent nearly two decades of a 57year sentence in a federal prison for serious crimes that no one disputes he committed There were armed carjackings and his participation in an illegal chop shop where stolen cars would be dismantled and sold for partsBut the fairness of the mandatory sentence has been a matter of dispute not only for Mr Holloway but also for a surprising and most effective advocate the trial judge John GleesonAs Mr Holloway filed one motion after another trying to get his sentence and his case reevaluated Judge Gleeson of Federal District Court in Brooklyn began to speak out against those mandatory sentences that he believed were unduly harsh Mr Holloways 57year term was more than twice the average sentence in the district for murder in 1996 the year he was sentencedMore recently Judge Gleeson began his own campaign on Mr Holloways behalf writing to Loretta E Lynch who is the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York to request that she vacate two of Mr Holloways convictionsThe payoff from Judge Gleesons efforts will be apparent on Tuesday in a highly unusual hearing when the judge is expected to resentence Mr Holloway who is 57 to time servedProsecutors also use their power to remedy injustices Judge Gleeson wrote in a memorandum released on Monday Even people who are indisputably guilty of violent crimes deserve justice and now Holloway will get itSentencing experts characterized Judge Gleesons effort as exceptional saying it could be a blueprint for judges who want to revisit sentences that are legally required but in their view unjustifiably longThe normal attitude has been This is terrible but the law is the law  said Douglas A Berman a sentencing expert at Ohio State University referring to severe sentences Rather than waiting for Congress to act or waiting for the president to grant massive clemency he said Judge Gleeson appears to believe that this is a problem that federal prosecutors and judges not only ought to be tackling but are better positioned to tackleThe judges effort reflects a softening national view of sentencing moving away from what is now generally perceived as an overincarceration problem stemming from the crime wave of the 1980s and 90s Some nonviolent drug offenders are getting more lenient treatment and some 50000 people in prison for those sorts of offenses may have their sentences reconsidered in the most sweeping sentencing reform in decadesBut people like Mr Holloway who committed violent crimes have basically been overlookedNo one is saying Mr Holloway didnt do what he was convicted of doing said Harlan J Protass who was appointed in May as his lawyer No ones saying there was legal error along the way This is sort of a case of mercyMr Holloway was charged in 1995 with three counts of carjacking and using a gun during a violent crime even though it was an accomplice and not Mr Holloway who carried the gun along with participating in the chop shop The government offered him a plea deal of about 11 years He turned it down after his lawyer assured him he could win at trial Mr Holloway did not winFor the first conviction on the gun count the law required Mr Holloway to receive five years But for the second and third convictions the law required 20 years for each one served consecutively a requirement known as stacking which some judges and lawyers argue sounds like a recidivism provision although it can be applied for crimes like Mr Holloways committed hours apart that are part of the same trialNone of Mr Holloways codefendants who all pleaded guilty received more than six yearsAt Mr Holloways sentencing in 1996 Judge Gleeson said that by stripping me of discretion the stacked gun charges require the imposition of a sentence that is in essence a life sentence The remainder of the 57 years was the 12 years required for the three carjackingsMr Holloway went to prison where he was scheduled to remain until 2045 His appeal in his case based on how prosecutors had to prove intent under the carjacking law went to the United States Supreme Court which affirmed in a divided vote his conviction and his sentenceLast year Judge Gleeson appealed to Ms Lynch pointing out that even the sentencing commission which coordinates federal sentencing policy told Congress in 2011 that stacking is excessively severe and unjustMr Protass Mr Holloways lawyer discovered two precedents where prosecutors had agreed to drop convictions that prompted stacked sentences which he used to help persuade the government to vacate the two convictionsIn Montana a woman named Marion Hungerford accompanied her boyfriend who was armed on a spree of seven robberies holding up casinos and convenience stores Described in court papers as being profoundly mentally disabled Ms Hungerford was sentenced in 2005 to a 159year sentence 155 of which came from the legally mandated stacked gun charges After she fought the sentence from prison and with urging from the judge the government agreed in 2010 to drop six of those seven gun convictions and she was resentenced to 93 monthsIn another Montana case a medical marijuana distributor who owned guns was convicted of four counts of possessing a firearm during drug trafficking along with other charges which meant an 80year sentence on the stacked gun charges alone After the jury verdict but before sentencing a federal judge pushed prosecutors and the defense to hold a settlement conference where prosecutors agreed to drop three of those counts Saying some mandatory minimums were unfair and absurd that judge Dana L Christensen sentenced the defendant Christopher Williams to five yearsBut Ms Lynch the federal prosecutor declined to vacate the convictions suggesting that Mr Holloway could ask for clemencyIn May Judge Gleeson urged Ms Lynch to reconsider Clemency is not a realistic avenue to justice for Holloway the judge wrote because the Justice Department is prioritizing clemency for nonviolent offenders He cited Mr Holloways family his clean disciplinary record and his participation in prison programs as evidence of his rehabilitation and his prospect of a normal postprison lifeMs Lynch acquiescedAt a hearing on the Holloway case this month an assistant United States attorney Sam Nitze said that this is both a unique case and a unique defendant citing his extraordinary disciplinary record and his work in prisonAlso he said three of Mr Holloways carjacking victims have said that the 20 years that Mr Holloway had served in prison was an awfully long time and people deserve another chanceMr Nitze agreed to vacate the two convictions while emphasizing that this should not be taken as indicative of Ms Lynchs view on the stacking provision in other casesIn his opinion issued last week Judge Gleeson said that Mr Holloways sentence illustrated a trial penalty where those willing to risk trial could be hit with mandatory minimum sentences that would be laughable if only there werent real people on the receiving end of themAlthough Mr Holloways federal prison time should be finished on Tuesday he still owes New York State a minimum of nine more months before he is eligible for parole stemming from a 1991 drugselling conviction he was transferred to federal custody in the carjacking case before he finished that sentence That means he will most likely be transferred to a New York prison or jail until next yearJudge Gleeson though seemed to feel he had moved the needleThere are no floodgates to worry about the authority exercised in this case will be used only as often as the Department of Justice itself chooses to exercise it which will no doubt be sparingly he wrote in his opinion But the misuse of prosecutorial power over the past 25 years has resulted in a significant number of federal inmates who are serving grotesquely severe sentences,2014-07-29T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/29/nyregion/fighting-a-no-pets-eviction-with-doctors-notes-and-a-federal-suit.html,Outside the brick behemoths of the East River Housing coop on the Lower East Side is an inscription quoting Sidney Hillman the labor leader who helped build these affordable homes for thousands of garment workers and othersWe want to have an America that will have no sense of insecurity and make it possible for all groups regardless of race creed or color to live in friendship to be real neighborsJust so long as those neighbors do not have any pets For the past 84 years the board and managers of the sprawling 1627apartment property have maintained a fairly strict nopets policyAmerica or rather the federal government wants to change thatFor the past two years the board has sought to evict the dogs of three residents or their owners should they refuse to comply All three residents have claimed medical necessity in having pets that the animals help stabilize depression anxiety and other afflictions an increasingly common practice in the city But because the East River Housing residents sought exemptions only after the building found out about the dogs the board maintains their doctors notes and therapeutic claims are a ruseThe board has no problem accommodating pets Bradley Silverbush the boards lawyer said The problem is with people trying to sneak in their animals and then thinking they can pull a fast one when they get caughtBut where the board saw chicanery the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development found discrimination After a series of losses for the three residents in housing and state appeals courts over the past two years they filed complaints last year with HUD arguing that the building was violating their rights under the Fair Housing Act by discriminating on the basis of disabilityThe agency agreed and referred the cases to the Department of Justice which sued the coop in federal court in Manhattan in December Papers have been traded all winter and spring and it looks as if there will be little resolution until pretrial hearings set for fallStephanie Aaron one of the East River Housing tenants involved in the eviction fight readily admits that she knew the rules I had no intention of keeping Rosie she said while sitting inside her 15thfloor apartment with views stretching from the World Trade Center to the Empire State Building But I saved her life and she saved mineMs Aaron has suffered from depression since childhood but she is warm and animated around Rosie an American Staffordshire terrierboxer mix who has the sylvan coat and build of a pit bull Ms Aaron is quick to point out that distinction knowing the harsh reputation most pit bulls face and to which she feels she is subjected by some neighborsShe found the dog tied to a bench in East River Park almost two years ago It was the middle of a heat wave the dog was desperately panting and Ms Aaron brought Rosie home to cool her down and try to find the ownerNone ever materialized What did show up within weeks was a letter from the board saying she had 10 days to get rid of the dogMs Aaron who lives alone became distraught When she fretted to her psychiatrist the doctor said it would be good for her health to keep Rosie and wrote a letter to the board The board rejected the request and instead took Ms Aaron to housing court where a judge ruled against her Her appeal to the states Human Rights Commission was also rejectedThe evidence does not support that complainants dog is necessary as opposed to helpful to the use and enjoyment of her home the commissions decision saidMs Aaron finds the argument absurd Its like saying you cant take this new medication because youve never taken it before she said If it helps that is all that mattersSteven Gilbert another of the three tenants fighting the eviction does not even have a dog he was simply watching one for a friend when the board found out and asked him to remove it which he did But the thought of having a companion enticed him so he requested a waiver on the same grounds as Ms Aaron The dog had improved his mental health He was rejected on the same grounds for asking after the fact and is currently battling over more than 30000 in legal fees the board wants him to reimburse for defending his discrimination claimLawyers for boards and landlords worry that if the government prevails in its case it could create a stampede of little paws into buildings where they are supposedly barred In the same way prescriptions for medical marijuana are sometimes seen as a scheme they fear the same could happen here Were already seeing a lot of suspicious prescriptions Todd Nahins a real estate lawyer saidAnd just how much these dogs help remains a matter of disputeAmy Eisenberg the third member of the suit got a cockapoo in early 2012 and found that it helped with stress related to the Sept 11 terrorist attack She worked in a building across the street from the World Trade Center and watched the event unfold But Ms Eisenbergs doctor who initially supported the claim has since withdrawn support for the dog though the government continues to sustain her caseWhat bothers the three tenants most they said is that theirs are not the only dogs in the development A private investigator hired by Ms Eisenberg documented dozens of dogs coming and going in a twohour stretch this year Ms Aarons dog walker said his business was made up entirely of a dozen dogs living at East River Housing And part of the case against Ms Aaron involves a fight Rosie had with another residents dog though that person has faced no penalty from the boardMany of these dogs either belonged to longtime tenants said Mr Silverbush the boards lawyer or slipped in through a city rule that allows tenants to keep pets if they have lived openly in the building for 90 days without objectionIf the neighbors dont complain what can we do he saidAnd Mr Silverbush added it shows we do not discriminate against all dog owners,2014-07-29T00:00:00Z,drugs

Michigan couple growing legal medicinal pot is taken by childprotection authorities after an exhusband says their plants endangered kidsAnd police officers in New Jersey visit a home after a 9yearold mentions his mothers hemp advocacy at schoolWhile the cases were eventually decided in favor of the parents the incidents underscore a growing dilemma While a pot plant in the basement may not bring criminal charges in many states the same plant can become a piece of evidence in child custody or abuse casesThe legal standard is always the best interest of the children and you can imagine how subjective that can get said Jess Cochrane who helped found Bostonbased Family Law  Cannabis Alliance after finding childabuse laws have been slow to catch up with pot policyNo data exist to show how often pot use comes up in custody disputes or how often childwelfare workers intervene in homes where marijuana is usedBut in dozens of interviews with lawyers and officials who work in this area along with activists who counsel parents on marijuana and child endangerment the consensus is clear Pots growing acceptance is complicating the task of determining when kids are in dangerA failed proposal in the Colorado Legislature this year showed the dilemmaColorado considers adult marijuana use legal but pot is still treated like heroin and other Schedule I substances as they are under federal law As a result when it comes to defining a drugendangered child pot cant legally be in a home where children resideTwo Democratic lawmakers tried to update the law by saying that marijuana must also be shown to be a harm or risk to children to constitute abuseBut the effort led to angry opposition from both sides  potusing parents who feared the law could still be used to take their children and marijuanalegalization opponents who argued that pot remains illegal under federal law and that its very presence in a home threatens kidsAfter hours of emotional testimony lawmakers abandoned the effort as too complicated Among the tearyeyed moms at the hearing was Moriah Barnhart who moved to the Denver area from Tampa Florida in search of a cannabisbased treatment for a daughter with brain cancerWe moved here across the country so we wouldnt be criminals But all it takes is one neighbor not approving of what were doing one police officer who doesnt understand and the law says Im a child abuser Barnhart saidSupporters vow to try again to give law enforcement some definitions about when the presence of drugs could harm children even if the kids dont use itThere are people who are very reckless with what theyre doing leaving marijuana brownies on the coffee table or doing hash oil extraction that might blow the place up Too often with law enforcement theyre just looking at the legality of the behavior and not how it is affecting the children said Jim Gerhardt of the Colorado Drug Investigators Association which supported the billColorado courts are wading into the question of when adult pot use endangers kids The state Court of Appeals in 2010 sided with a marijuanausing dad who lost visitation rights though he never used the drug around his daughterThe court reversed a county courts decision that the father couldnt have unsupervised visitation until passing a drug test saying that a parents marijuana use when away from his or her children doesnt suggest any risk of child harmBut childendangerment standards remain murky in Colorado with wide disparities in how local childprotection officers and law enforcement approach pot said Rob Corry a Denver lawyer who successfully argued the fathers custody appealCorry who helped Colorados 2012 campaign to legalize recreational marijuana said the main thrust of the effort was to treat pot like alcoholThink of brewing beer Youve got a constitutional right to do it Theres nothing wrong with it Marijuana should be just as simple  you just keep it on a high shelf right next to your vodka But in practice this is not how law enforcement treats marijuana he saidIn the absence of legal guidelines a growing network of blogs counsel parents in how to deal with police or childprotection agencies concerned about parental marijuana use including one Ladybud run by legalpot activist Diane FornbacherShe said she moved to Colorado this year after childprotection workers

visitation with a child for following the statute a legal dispute with her exhusband led to her daughter being placed with a grandparent until it was resolvedThe exhusband who brought the complaint

used the life insurance payout to hire a smuggler to take her to Florida She promised to send for him quickly but she has notThree people he knows were murdered this year Four others were gunned down on a nearby corner in the span of two weeks at the beginning of this year A girl his age resisted being robbed of 5 She was clubbed over the head and dragged off by two men who cut a hole in her throat stuffed her panties in it and left her body in a ravine across the street from Cristians houseIm going this year he tells meI last went to Nueva Suyapa in 2003 to write about another boy Luis Enrique Motio Pineda who had grown up there and left to find his mother in the United States Children from Central America have been making that journey often without their parents for two decades But lately something has changed and the predictable flow has turned into an exodus Three years ago about 6800 children were detained by United States immigration authorities and placed in federal custody this year as many as 90000 children are expected to be picked up Around a quarter come from Honduras  more than from anywhere elseChildren still leave Honduras to reunite with a parent or for better educational and economic opportunities But as I learned when I returned to Nueva Suyapa last month a vast majority of child migrants are fleeing not poverty but violence As a result what the United States is seeing on its borders now is not an immigration crisis It is a refugee crisis Gangs arrived in force in Honduras in the 1990s as 18th Street and Mara Salvatrucha members were deported in large numbers from Los Angeles to Central America joining homegrown groups like Los Puchos But the dominance in the past few years of foreign drug cartels in Honduras especially ones from Mexico has increased the reach and viciousness of the violence As the United States and Colombia spent billions of dollars to disrupt the movement of drugs up the Caribbean corridor traffickers rerouted inland

to gain more foot soldiers for drug sales and distribution expand their customer base and make money through extortion in a country left with an especially weak corrupt government following a 2009 coupEnriques 33yearold sister Belky who still lives in Nueva Suyapa says children began leaving en masse for the United States three years ago That was around the time that the narcos started putting serious pressure on kids to work for them At Cristians school older students working with the cartels push drugs on the younger ones  some as young as 6 If they agree children are recruited to serve as lookouts make deliveries in backpacks rob people and extort businesses They are given food shoes and money in return Later they might work as traffickers or hit menTeachers at Cristians school described a 12yearold who demanded that the school release three students one day to help him distribute crack cocaine he brandished a pistol and threatened to kill a teacher when she tried to question himAt Nueva Suyapas only public high school narcos recruit inside the school says Yadira Sauceda a counselor there Until he was killed a few weeks ago a 23yearold student controlled the school Each day he was checked by security at the door then had someone sneak his gun to him over the school wall Five students mostly 12 and 13yearolds tearfully told Ms Sauceda that the man had ordered them to use and distribute drugs or he would kill their parents By March one month into the new school year 67 of 450 students had left the schoolTeachers must pay a war tax to teach in certain neighborhoods and students must pay to attendCarlos Baquedano Snchez a slender 14yearold with hair sticking straight up explained how hard it was to stay away from the cartels He lives in a shack made of corrugated tin in a neighborhood in Nueva Suyapa called El Infiernito  Little Hell  and usually doesnt have anything to eat one out of every three days He started working in a dump when he was 7 picking out iron or copper to recycle for 1 or 2 a day But bigger boys often beat him to steal his haul and he quit a year ago when an older man nearly killed him for a coveted carengine piston Now he sells scrap woodBut all of this was nothing he says compared to the relentless pressure to join narco gangs and the constant danger they have brought to his life When he was 9 he barely escaped from two narcos who were trying to rape him while terrified neighbors looked on When he was 10 he was pressured to try marijuana and crack Youll feel better Like you are in the clouds a teenager working with a gang told him But he resistedHe has known eight people who were murdered and seen three killed right in front of him He saw a man shot three years ago and still remembers the plums the man was holding rolling down the street coated in blood Recently he witnessed two teenage hit men shooting a pair of brothers for refusing to hand over the keys and title to their motorcycle Carlos hit the dirt and prayed The killers calmly walked down the street Carlos shrugs Now seeing someone dead is nothingHe longs to be an engineer or mechanic but he quit school after sixth grade too poor and too afraid to attend A lot of kids know what can happen in school So they leaveHe wants to go to the United States even though he knows how dangerous the journey can be a man in his neighborhood lost both legs after falling off the top of a Mexican freight train and a family friend drowned in the Rio Grande I want to avoid drugs and death The government cant pull up its pants and help people he says angrily My country has lost its wayGirls face particular dangers  one reason around 40 percent of children who arrived in the United States this year were girls compared with 27 percent in the past Recently three girls were raped and killed in Nueva Suyapa one only 8 years old Two 15yearolds were abducted and raped The kidnappers told them that if they didnt get in the car they would kill their entire families Some parents no longer let their girls go to school for fear of their being kidnapped says Luis Lpez an educator with Asociacin Compartir a nonprofit in Nueva SuyapaMilagro Noemi Martnez a petite 19yearold with clear green eyes has been told repeatedly by narcos that she would be theirs  or end up dead Last summer she made her first attempt to reach the United States Here there is only evil she says Its better to leave than have them kill me here She headed north with her 21yearold sister a friend who had also been threatened and 170 among them But she was stopped and deported from Mexico Now back in Nueva Suyapa she stays locked inside her mothers house I hope God protects me I am afraid to step outside Last year she says six minors as young as 15 were killed in her neighborhood Some were hacked apart She plans to try the journey again soon Asking for help from the police or the government is not an option in what some consider a failed state The drugs that pass through Honduras each year are worth more than the countrys entire gross domestic product Narcos have bought off police officers politicians and judges In recent years four out of five homicides were never investigated No one is immune to the carnage Several Honduran mayors have been killed The sons of both the former head of the police department and the head of the national university were murdered the latter an investigation showed by the policeYou never call the cops The cops themselves will retaliate and kill you says Henry Caras Aguilar a pastor in Nueva Suyapa A majority of small businesses in Nueva Suyapa have shuttered because of extortion demands while churches have doubled in number in the past decade as people pray for salvation from what they see as the plague predicted in the Bible Taxis and homes have signs on them asking God for mercyThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recently interviewed 404 children who had arrived in the United States from Honduras El Salvador Guatemala and Mexico 58 percent said their primary reason for leaving was violence A similar survey in 2006 of Central American children coming into Mexico found that only 13 percent were fleeing violence They arent just going to the United States Less conflicted countries in Central America had a 712 percent increase in asylum claims between 2008 and 2013If a house is burning people will jump out the window says Michelle Bran director of the migrant rights and justice program at the Womens Refugee CommissionTO permanently stem this flow of children we must address the complex root causes of violence in Honduras as well as the demand for illegal drugs in the United States that is fueling that violenceIn the meantime however we must recognize this as a refugee crisis as the United Nations just recommended These children are facing threats similar to the forceful conscription of child soldiers by warlords in Sudan or during the civil war in Bosnia Being forced to sell drugs by narcos is no different from being forced into military serviceMany Americans myself included believe in deporting unlawful immigrants but see a different imperative with refugeesThe United States should immediately create emergency refugee centers inside our borders tent cities  operated by the United Nations and other relief groups like the International Rescue Committee  where immigrant children could be held for 60 to 90 days instead of being released The government would post immigration judges at these centers and adjudicate childrens cases thereTo ensure this isnt a sham process asylum officers and judges must be trained in childsensitive interviewing techniques to help elicit information from fearful traumatized youngsters All children must also be represented by a volunteer or governmentfunded lawyer Kids in Need of Defense a nonprofit that recruits pro bono lawyers to represent immigrant children and whose board I serve on estimates that 40 percent to 60 percent of these children potentially qualify to stay under current immigration laws  and do if they have a lawyer by their side The vast majority do not The only way to ensure we are not hurtling children back to circumstances that could cost them their lives is by providing them with real due processJudges who currently deny seven in 10 applications for asylum by people who are in deportation proceedings must better understand the conditions these children are facing They should be more open to considering relief for those fleeing gang recruitment or threats by criminal organizations when they come from countries like Honduras that are clearly unwilling or unable to protect themIf many children dont meet strict asylum criteria but face significant dangers if they return the United States should consider allowing them to stay using humanitarian parole procedures we have employed in the past for Cambodians and Haitians It may be possible to transfer children and resettle them in other safe countries willing to share the burden We should also make it easier for children to apply as refugees when they are still in Central America as we have done for people in Iraq Cuba countries in the former Soviet Union Vietnam and Haiti Those who showed a wellfounded fear of persecution wouldnt have to make the perilous journey north aloneOf course many migrant children come for economic reasons and not because they fear for their lives In those cases they should quickly be deported if they have at least one parent in their country of origin  By deporting them directly from the refugee centers the United States would discourage future nonrefugees by showing that immigrants cannot be caught and released and then avoid deportation by ignoring court orders to attend immigration hearingsInstead of advocating such a humane practical approach the Obama administration wants to intercept and return children en route On Tuesday the president asked for 37 billion in emergency funding Some money would be spent on new detention facilities and more immigration judges but the main goal seems to be to strengthen border control and speed up deportations He also asked Congress to grant powers that could eliminate legal protections for children from Central America in order to expedite removals a change that Republicans in Congress have also advocatedThis would allow lifeordeath decisions to be made within hours by Homeland Security officials even though studies have shown that border patrol agents fail to adequately screen Mexican children to see if they are being sexually exploited by traffickers or fear persecution as the agents are supposed to do Why would they start asking Central American children key questions needed to prove refugee statusThe United States expects other countries to take in hundreds of thousands of refugees on humanitarian grounds Countries neighboring Syria have absorbed nearly 3 million people Jordan has accepted in two days what the United States has received in an entire month during the height of this immigration flow  more than 9000 children in May The United States should also increase to pre911 levels the number of refugees we accept to 90000 from the current 70000 per year and unlike in recent years actually admit that manyBy sending these children away you are handing them a death sentence says Jos Arnulfo Ochoa Ochoa an expert in Honduras with World Vision International a Christian humanitarian aid group This abrogates international conventions we have signed and undermines our credibility as a humane country It would be a disgrace if this wealthy nation turned its back on the 52000 children who have arrived since October many of them legitimate refugeesThis is not how a great nation treats children,2014-07-13T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/05/08/us/ap-us-medicinal-marijuana-insurers.html,Patients who use medical marijuana for pain and other chronic symptoms can take an unwanted hit Insurers dont cover the treatment which costs as much as 1000 a monthOnce the drug of choice for hippies and rebellious teens marijuana in recent years has gained more mainstream acceptance for its ability to boost appetite dull pain and reduce seizures in everyone from epilepsy to cancer patientsStill insurers are reluctant to cover it in part because of conflicting laws While 21 US states have passed laws approving it for medical use the drug still is illegal federally and in most statesBut perhaps the biggest hurdle for insurers is the US Food and Drug Administration hasnt approved it Major insurers generally dont cover treatments that are not approved by the FDA and that approval depends on big clinical studies that measure safety effectiveness and side effectsThat research can take years and millions of dollars And while the FDA has approved treatments like Marinol that contain a synthetic version of an ingredient in marijuana so far no one has gained approval for a treatment that uses the whole plantAs a result of the obstacles advocates for medicinal marijuana say insurers likely wont cover the drug in the next few years In the meantime medical marijuana users  of which advocates estimate there are more than 1 million nationwide  have to find other ways to pay for their treatmentBill Britt for instance gets his supply for free from a friend whom he helps to grow the plants Britt lives mostly on Social Security income and uses marijuana every day for epileptic seizures and leg pain from a childhood case of polioIm just lucky I have somebody who is helping me out but that could go away at any time said Britt 55 who lives in Long Beach California I am always worried about thatInsurers have not seen enough evidence that marijuana is safe and more effective than other treatments said Susan Pisano a spokeswoman for Americas Health Insurance Plans an industry trade groupMarijuanas Schedule I classification under the federal Controlled Substances Act makes it difficult to conduct clinical studies that might provide that evidence The classification means the drug is considered to have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use And that means extra precautions are required in order to study itResearchers have to apply to the FDA to approve their study Public Health Service another arm of the Department of Health and Human Services also may review it a process that can take monthsThe Drug Enforcement Administration has to issue a permit after making sure researchers have a secure place to store the drug Researchers also have to explain the study plan to the National Institute on Drug Abuse or NIDA another agency within Health and Human ServicesAnd researchers have to use marijuana supplied by NIDA which contracts with the University of Mississippi to grow the only federally sanctioned source of the drug That can limit the options for strains of marijuana researchers can studyOn top of that researchers must find a location where the marijuana can be smoked or vaporized and scientists can monitor the patients afterward Thats no easy task especially when dealing with public universitiesThe word marijuana is just so politically radioactive said Dr Sue Sisley a University of Arizona psychiatrist who is trying to study the drug as a possible treatment for military veterans with posttraumatic stress disorderThe American Medical Association has called for a change in marijuanas classification to one that makes it easier for research to be conducted The current classification prevents physicians from even prescribing it in states where medical use is permitted Instead they can only recommend it to patientsThere is no easy and cheap way to get the drug legally Patients in states where medical marijuana is legal can either grow it or buy it from governmentapproved dispensariesAt dispensaries an eighth of an ounce which produces three to seven joints costs between 25 and 60 said Mike Liszewski policy director for Americans for Safe Access which advocates for safe and legal access to therapeutic cannabis He noted that such an amount may not last long for patients who use the drug regularly to control pain or before every meal to help their appetites Those patients might spend 1000 a month or morePatients may get a price break from their dispensary if they have a low income but that depends on the dispensaryGrowing marijuana costs less but takes three or four months And success depends on a number of factors including the growers skill And there are other problems Britt from Long Beach California tried growing it in his backyard only to have thieves steal itAllen St Pierre executive director of the nonprofit National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws or NORML thinks insurers may eventually cover vaporized or eaten forms of marijuana But he says when that happens depends in part on factors like who wins the 2016 presidential electionEven if the FDA approves medicinal marijuana theres no guarantee that insurance coverage will become widespread Big companies that pay medical bills for their workers and dependents decide what items their insurance plans cover They may not be eager to add the expenseMeanwhile patients like Kari Boiter 33 continue to get medical marijuana however they can Boiter has a genetic disorder that causes pain nausea and vomiting and she uses marijuana she helps grow in a cooperative garden to control the symptomsBoiter who lives in Tacoma Washington and is unemployed said shed have to go back to largely ineffective prescriptions or do without treatment if the cooperative went awayIt would be really hard for me she said,2014-05-08T10:26:50Z,drugs

and federally regulated industry with a distinct appeal to the more daring global investorAbout a dozen producers of the drug will find themselves in the spotlight this year as they consider going public or prepare to so through share sales or reverse takeovers to capitalize on recent regulatory changes investment bankers saidThe Canadian companies are in a race to raise money to build facilities attract patients and grab shares in a market projected to grow to C13 billion 120 billion in the next 10 yearsDespite facing considerable risks they have the advantage of being in one of the few countries where medical marijuana is legal nationwide and where licensed operators can massproduce itIn the United States the drug remains illegal at the federal level Some 20 US states have legalized medical marijuana but investors worry about the prospect however remote that the federal government may strike down those lawsAlthough the US market is home to companies including Medical Marijuana Inc and Cannabis Science Inc their northern counterparts are likely to benefit from greater legitimacy and legal clarity Sources said much of the private equity investment in the Canadian industry had come from the United StatesCanada is one of the few countries anywhere where its citizens have a constitutionally protected right to access medical marijuana with a physicians consent

overhaul by regulator Health Canada has thrown the market open More than 850 companies have applied for licenses to produce the drug and 13 have obtained them so farThis is Health Canadas realization that medical marijuana deserves to have a space in the treatment paradigm said Bloom Burton President Brian Bloom What theyre asking in return is that the standards of manufacturing distribution and vigilance are similar to what is seen in the pharmaceutical industryAnalysts expect only a few major companies to remain standing a few years from nowThe winners will be the ones that are going to have a strong brand a strong customer acquisition strategy and have the ability to scale up quickly said Jacob Securities analyst Khurram MalikHealth Canada estimates the sector will grow tenfold in its first 10 years reaching about 450000 users and C13 billion in salesMalik says that is only half of the markets potential because the same number of people already use medical marijuana through the black market and Health Canadas measures will bring greater access and lower pricesIts an industry that has been born out of almost nothing and it is moving very rapidly into something very large he said The flip side is youre also going to have a lot of riskIndeed a list of risk factors takes up about half of the 22 pages in Tweeds latest quarterly filingPotential industry pitfalls include legal

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/07/17/us/politics/17reuters-usa-immigration-children-factbox.html,WASHINGTON   Why are tens of thousands of children from Guatemala El Salvador and Honduras fleeing their homes to go on a dangerous journey to the United States often without their parents or other relativesThe complex backdrop for the surge of children has embroiled President Barack Obama and the US Congress as they struggle to discourage the arrival of unaccompanied minors who are creating a humanitarian crisis on Texas border with MexicoThe Obama administration estimates that around 90000 children will arrive by the end of September and rise to 150000 next year unless steps are taken to reverse the migrationHere are reasons cited by immigration experts and politicians for the rush of people under the age of 18 arriving in the United States illegally Taken together they may have created the perfect storm that helps explain what is occurring on the southwestern border but also means there is no easy fixANTITRAFFICKING LAWIn late 2008 President George W Bush signed into law legislation to combat trafficking of humans for forced sex and labor The measure created new protections for children who arrive in the United States from noncontiguous countriesThe William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 named after a British abolitionist who lived in the late 1700s and early 1800s made it more difficult for the US government to quickly deport immigrant minors who were not from Mexico or CanadaThe Obama administration many immigration experts and members of Congress think this law is encouraging children to flee to the United StatesDRUGS GANGS CRIMECriminal gangs related to drug trafficking proliferate in Central America and Mexico and they prey upon children and teenagers to work for them or face physical harm and even deathFor many kids the only way to escape the violence is by escaping their homelandThe narcotics trade thrives off a vigorous market for marijuana and other drugs in the United States Some US officials are tying insufficient funds for fighting drugs in Central America to the waves of child migration Honduran President Juan Hernandez said USbacked battles against cartels in Colombia and Mexico have pushed drug traffickers into Central America increasing the violence that is fueling the exodusLawlessness stemming from weak governments natural disasters and civil unrest help drive migration Honduras has the worlds highest murder rate and those of El Salvador and Guatemala have consistently ranked near the topFAMILY REUNIFICATIONThe United States also is a magnet for Central American laborers who find jobs ranging from housekeepers and office janitors to farm hands who harvest crops and help birth calves Once established in the country immigrant parents often send for their childrenIMPROVING US ECONOMYA strengthening US economy after years of languishing during and after the recession that began in 2007 gives immigrant parents already in the United States  be they legal or undocumented  added reason to send for children still living in Central AmericaThey believe an improved job market means that they and their children will have even greater opportunity in the United States another factor encouraging family reunificationPOVERTY IN CENTRAL AMERICAAbout 65 percent of Hondurans are living at the poverty line and Guatemalas poverty is among the highest in the region with malnutrition and child mortality also a problem according to the World BankPoverty at home coupled with the large and relatively strong US economy to the north create a lure Many youths who get sent back vow to try again and againDOMESTIC ABUSEChildren in Guatemala El Salvador and Honduras suffer high levels of child abuse Experts attribute it to a mix of poverty alcoholism and drug violence If they can make it to the US border children who can demonstrate domestic abuse can be eligible for special immigrant status in the United StatesCLIMATE CHANGECentral American coffee crops are being devastated by a fungus epidemic related to higher temperaturesAccording to the International Coffee Organization 70 percent of coffee crops in Guatemala were affected in the 201213 crop year 74 percent in El Salvador and 25 percent in HondurasThe problem which some attribute to climate change contributing to the regions warming severely affects farmers incomes creating yet another push factor for children to seek a better life in the United StatesOBAMA ACTIONSMany Republicans blame Obama entirely for the rush of children to the US borderThey point to his actions easing deportations of some children who were brought to the United States by their parents before mid2007 They also cite the administrations decision to focus deportation efforts on undocumented residents with criminal records instead of those who are raising families paying taxes and have established deep roots in the United StatesThese actions they argue have helped human traffickers in Central America market their services by pointing to relaxed enforcement in US immigration laws In fact deportations have sharply increased under the Obama administration which has deported more than 2 million people and earned Obama the title of deporter in chief from some immigration groupsIMMIGRATION COURT BACKLOGSIt can take years for juvenile deportation hearings to wind through US immigration courts leading many to believe that illegal entries will get children some time to establish themselves in the United States or at least enjoy a temporary reprieve from horrible conditions at homeUS FOCUS ELSEWHEREThe Sept 11 2001 attacks on the United States long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the global war on terrorism has put Central America in the back seat of US foreign policy prioritiesNot tending to Americas back yard has meant sluggish foreign aid and other development initiatives between Washington and Central AmericaThe United States has spent 800 million since 2008 on the Central America Regional Security Initiative to address arms and drug trafficking organized crime and shore up policing and government institutions in eight countries according to the Congressional Research ServiceThat figure is dwarfed by the billions Washington spends

end up having a particular disparate effectThe Manhattan district attorney Cyrus R Vance Jr said he was concerned that racial disparities had cropped up especially in the areas of pretrial detention and sentencing He promised to move forward with implicit bias training for his assistants to guard against unconscious prejudices in their decisionmakingIm glad to know the information Mr Vance said in an interview Its more important that we find out ask the question and deal directly with what is uncovered rather than failing to ask the question at allFunded by the Justice Department the study grew out of Mr Vances campaign promise to determine whether race played a role in the decisions of prosecutors In a rare move his office opened its books to the institutes analysts for 2010 and 2011 and gave them unfettered accessThe study is one of the largest of its kind to be done in the United States and its findings echoed what smaller studies had found in places like Milwaukee The authors examined 222542 resolved prosecutions over two years scrutinizing data for all misdemeanors and a selection of felonies including drug offensesThe report comes at a time of heightened public debate across the nation about whether the criminal justice system treats people of different races equally That debate drove the legal battle over the stopandfrisk program in New York City and has prompted the United States attorney general to order an examination of federal convictions and sentencing guidelinesIt is consistent with other studies Don Stemen an associate professor of criminology at Loyola University in Chicago said Even when controlling for all these legal factors race still has an impactOne of the starkest disparities emerged in the prosecution of misdemeanor drug crimes like possession of marijuana or cocaine The study found blacks were 27 percent more likely than whites to receive jail or prison time for misdemeanor drug offenses while Hispanic defendants were 18 percent more likely to be incarcerated for those crimesThe studys authors Besiki Luka Kutateladze and Nancy R Andiloro looked at five key points in a criminal case when prosecutors have significant discretion They examined the prosecutors decisions about which cases to accept which to dismiss what to recommend at bail hearings what plea bargains to offer and what sentences to recommendRace turned out to be a statistically significant factor at every stage save the initial decision to accept cases the study foundBlacks were 10 percent more likely than whites to be remanded to jail before trial or to be unable to make bail Asians fared even better than whites when it came to remaining free before trial 24 percent of white defendants were detained but only 14 percent of Asians were heldProsecutors were also found to be more likely to offer black and Hispanic defendants plea deals on misdemeanors that included jail time Forty percent of black defendants and 36 percent of Hispanic defendants were offered plea deals involving incarceration rather than probation or community service That ratio for whites was 33 percent and for Asians 17 percentAt sentencing blacks were also found to be slightly more likely to be sentenced to jail than whites and Latinos with Asians significantly less likely to receive jail termsSeymour W James Jr the attorney in chief at the Legal Aid Society said the study really confirms what we have been seeing for years in bail hearings and sentencing He said prosecutors should receive extensive training on how to counteract what he perceived might be their own unconscious prejudicesThe studys authors noted policy decisions may cause some of the inequalities The offices guidelines for plea offers on misdemeanors for instance requires harsher offers for defendants with an arrest history That works against defendants from heavily policed neighborhoodsDonna Lieberman the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union said the study raised troubling questions about the police policy in New York of making many arrests for minor offenses in highcrime neighborhoods under the socalled broken windows theory That policy has resulted in many black and Hispanic city residents with long arrest records making it harder for them to make bail and receive a nonjail sentence she saidKhalil Gibran Muhammad a historian and director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture said the racial disparities were not as bad as one might presume given the predominately black and Hispanic makeup of the state prison population The pipeline he said begins with the police decisions on who to arrest about 178000 of the 222000 defendants in the study were black or HispanicIt looks like the issue for Manhattan may be less one of what the prosecutors are doing over all and more one of what police officers are doing he said,2014-07-09T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/07/19/us/ap-us-lifers-new-hope.html,GREENVILLE Ill   From the very start Scott Walker refused to believe he would die in prisonArrested and jailed at 25 then sent to prison more than two years later Walker couldnt imagine spending his life behind bars for dealing drugs He told himself this wasnt the end that someday hed be released But the years passed his appeals failed and nothing changedNow after 17 years as an inmate Walker may have his best shot at freedom The Obama administration  responding to mounting concerns about decades of harsh penalties and overcrowded prisons  recently announced it will consider clemency for possibly thousands of nonviolent federal inmates most drug offendersWalker hopes this new offer holds the key to his cell doorHis lawyers are optimistic too noting in a July letter to the Justice Department that he meets all the criteria for possible release including serving a sentence that would have been substantially lower if imposed todayAdd to that support from an unlikely corner Walkers trial judge whos on record urging the president to reduce the sentence to 20 years He calls a life term excessive and disproportionate and says Walkers time in prison has been a handbook on selfimprovementScott Walkers story reflects a debate now intensifying in political and legal circles over decades of gettough laws that have jammed Americas prisons with drug offenders produced a growing outcry for sentencing reform and posed perhaps the trickiest question of all How do you make sure the punishment fits the crimeWalker says he knows he did wrong and should have paid a price But surely not for the rest of his lifeFrom the time youre a kid  you hear America is the land of redemption the land of liberty and the land of justice he says sitting in a conference room at the Federal Correctional Institution here in southern Illinois Wheres the land of mercy Is there mercy for people who have made mistakesWalker pauses then addsI believe everyone deserves a second chance in life___Looking back Walker says hes ashamed of what he did in his teens and 20sI find it very hard to relate to the person that I once was which makes it all the more difficult for me to live with my past mistakes he wrote in a 2009 letter to one of his lawyers Age and experience have given me new values hopes dreams and goals  This is something we dont comprehend when we are youngWalker now blames his past behavior on immaturity You feel like youre invincible that youre never going to grow old he saysWith straight brown hair parted down the middle framing his unlined face Walker looks a decade younger than 42 Speaking with a slight twang he remembers being so naive he thought he could be arrested for drug dealing only if caught in the actGrowing up in southern Illinois Walker started using marijuana around age 14 then graduated to meth becoming a hardcore addict He played guitar in a band and drugs he says were an accessory to his rocknroll lifestyleScott was a very strongwilled young man says Keith Shelton his stepfather He did not listen He didnt want to listen He felt like most kids do  Youre made out of steel Youre never going to get caught Things are always going to be the way you want them to turn outBy his late teens when his family moved to Arizona Walker began trafficking marijuana meth and LSD carrying drugs to Illinois where he funneled his profits into a 350to400aweek meth habit He became part of a looseknit ring sometimes selling drugs sometimes enlisting others mostly childhood friendsHis mother Brenda recalls knocking on her sons door during the peak of his meth use alarmed to see him rail thin I looked at him and said What are you doing What is wrong with you She took custody of his infant daughter  the childs mother approved  and with her husband raised the little girl as their own I think she kept me sane Shelton saysAfter his arrest on Nov 12 1996 as part of a drug conspiracy Walkers troubles only deepened partly because of some bad decisionsHe didnt cooperate with authorities because he didnt want his friends to suffer Informal discussions about a plea never went anywhere Walker unaware he was facing life chose to go trial despite overwhelming evidence against him Then his lawyer withdrew because of a conflict of interest When a public defender took over trial preparations had begun and it was too late for a pleaJudge J Phil Gilbert followed mandatory sentencing guidelines that added years for aggravating factors such as the amount of drugs his organizing role which included enlisting minors in the ring and previous misdemeanors The result a sentence of life with no chance for paroleGilbert told Walker while he needed to be punished severely whether this is the right sentence or not is not for me to judgeWalker later described by the judge as a middleman in the ring was the only one to receive lifeThree others went to trial and five pleaded guilty including the kingpin a twotime drug felon who cooperated and testified against Walker He served about five yearsIm happy theyre all out and free Walker says They didnt deserve to go through what Im going through now___By the time Walker was sentenced the nation was already reassessing two decades of stiff punitive drug lawsIn the 1970s and 1980s the war on drugs ushered in a dramatic transformation State and federal lawmakers fed up with rising crime rates increasing street violence and growing concerns about drug abuse responded with new measures imposing fixed severe sentencesIn New York for example the Rockefeller laws named after thenGov Nelson Rockefeller were passed in 1973 enacting severe penalties for selling or possessing drugs That same year in Michigan the 650lifer law passed mandating life without parole for possessing intending to or delivering more than 650 grams of cocaine or heroinIn 1980s as the crack epidemic ravaged big cities Congress responded In 1986 the federal AntiDrug Abuse Act imposed mandatory minimums for nearly all drugsThe only thing was How tough can we be says Eric Sterling who helped draft the bill as counsel for the House Judiciary Committee The general sentiment was the public wants it and this is what we should doThe goal was to go after highlevel traffickers he says but the way the law was written relatively small amounts triggered lengthy punishments such as five grams of crack  the size of five packets of artificial sweeteners  bringing a 5to40year sentenceWhile lawmakers intentions were good the approach was heavily focused on supply side If we punish we can smash the supply says Sterling who now heads the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation a drug policy and sentencing reform group There wasnt any real understanding this was a flawed premiseSupport for the crackdown came from both sides of the political aisle for different reasons says Douglas Berman a law professor at Ohio State University and expert on sentencing lawsThe right looked at rising crime rates and broader concern about social problems as a sign that weve been too soft too lenient that we need to just get tougher he says Thats where the length of sentences came in  The left was more concerned about disproportionate and unequal treatment between folks who came from prominent groups and had money and those who didnt Thats where the mandatory part came in By the early 90s though many judges began expressing doubts about mandatory minimums Sterling says with some refusing to take cases and many calling them unjustIn 1994 a federal sentencing law allowed judges leeway to reduce sentences for some drug offenders but it was narrow in scope and Walker did not qualifyIt wasnt until 2005 that a Supreme Court ruling gave judges more discretion with sentencing guidelines no longer mandatory That decision however applied only to future cases Again Walker was out of luck___David Zlotnick first encountered Walker as part of a research project A former federal prosecutor Zlotnick received a grant in 2002 to study Republicanappointed federal judges whod publicly disagreed with mandatory sentences theyd imposed in drug and gun cases He interviewed Walker and his judge an appointee of President George HW BushOver the years the lawyer and inmate stayed in touch forging a friendship through calls and lettersThis is really somebody who could be bitter could be angry could be hopeless says Zlotnick a professor at Roger Williams University School of Law Hes tried to make amends Hes usually in a pretty good mood  He sort of won me overZlotnick agreed to represent Walker in a commutation request He enlisted other lawyers and approached Gilbert now a senior judge seeking his supportIn a 2011 letter to the president Gilbert said this was his first recommendation for commutation in nearly two decades as a federal judge and called the case one of his most difficultGlibert noted Walker was not a kingpin the intended targets of life sentences Another factor that should be considered he said was that Walkers first attorney hadnt conveyed an offer of a plea agreement from the government Noting he wouldnt have been forced to impose a life term now the judge recommended a reduction to 20 years to correct the injustice And he praised Walker as an example of the human spirit at its strongestThe judge also mentioned Walkers ties to his family  newly hopeful because of the Justice Department reviewAngela Marvel one of Walkers three sisters says that for years she found it difficult to listen to her brothers optimismIt just drives you crazy because it hurts so hard she says I know what he was doing was wrong But he doesnt deserve to die there  In my heart I thought youre never going to get out and it killed me I could never say that to him Now I feel differentlyWalkers daughter Raele was just 4 when he was imprisoned Now about to turn 22 shes delaying her wedding hoping for her fathers release She brought her fiance to prison to meet himThough she has maintained contact with her father through visits calls and emails Raele acknowledges the strain of growing up without him I get angry sometimes or upset that he had to miss milestones in my life  starting college and graduating high school she says I feel we just got robbed of a lot of time togetherAn Arizona college student Raele plans to become a substance abuse counselor  a career she says inspired by her father I want to keep people from making these bad decisions she saysWalkers mother Brenda Shelton says throughout all these years her son has never felt sorry for himself He says Im not going to let the system beat me  Most guys get very hardened But Scott never gave up hope Hope springs eternal for ScottWalker occupies his time reading writing music  hes in a prison band called Ball and Chain  and taking trade courses Hed like to become a commercial truck driverIve seen people go to prison and just go buck wild and just join gangs and give in to that finality he says I always wanted to better myself and educate myself more I always felt that maybe Id go home eventually and I just wanted to make sure that I didnt become a worse person by being in prison___Whether Scott Walker goes free ultimately depends on the presidentA recommendation from the office of the pardon attorney in the Justice Department will be forwarded to the White HouseWalkers lawyers say he meets all six criteria for release including a good prison record and having served at least 10 years In their petition theyve included a plan for postprison life Hed live with his sister Angela in her familys house in Illinois A pastor a longtime friend has written commitments from two trucking companies whod consider hiring WalkerI believe that he is ready to reenter society and contribute as a lawabiding and taxpaying citizen and devoted son grandson and father wrote Darin Schultz one of his lawyers seeking a commutation to 20 years If the petition is granted and Walker is given credit for good behavior while incarcerated he could be released soonWalkers bid comes amid years of deepening reservations by the public and elected officials about tough drug sentences From 2009 to 2013 40 states  many facing tight budgets and overcrowded prisons  took steps to ease their drug laws according to a Pew Research Center analysisOn the federal level US Attorney General Eric Holder has urged drug sentencing reform but proposals have stalled in Congress despite bipartisan support Tens of thousands of federal drug offenders also may be eligible for early release as a result of a decision Friday by the US Sentencing Commission The panel which voted this year to substantially lower recommended sentences for those incarcerated for drug cases unanimously agreed to retroactively apply that change to those already behind barsThat decision and the clemency review focusing on nonviolent offenders aim to reduce the bloated federal prison system where about half the inmates are serving time for drug crimes  These steps are designed to scale back stringent penalties and address disproportionately tough sentences imposed on black offenders during the 1980s crack epidemic A 2010 law narrowed some of those gapsNot everyone though feels a need for changeWilliam Otis an adjunct law professor at Georgetown who was special counsel to George H W Bush says to categorize drug cases as nonviolent ignores the social destructiveness that goes on from the consumption and dealing in illegal drugs  Was Scott Walker thinking about whats going to happen to the people who used the LSD or who used the methOtis also rejects the notion Walker and others merely made a mistakeThey made decisions about how they wanted to live and how they wanted to make money he says The whole meaning of accountability is people have to take the consequences of their conscious decisions___Sitting in prison looking out at lush farm fields Walker ponders a future on the other sideIm always thinking that Im going home tomorrow he says with a laugh I think its probably the healthiest way you can liveHe says he tries to tamp down rosy pictures he has about being free realizing life aint all that wonderful at times   I have to remind myself that not everything is so easy

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/06/01/us/ap-us-california-drought-pot-farms.html,SAN FRANCISCO   Some droughtstricken rivers and streams in Northern Californias coastal forests are being polluted and sucked dry by waterguzzling medical marijuana farms wildlife officials say  an issue that has spurred at least one county to try to outlaw personal growsState fish and wildlife officials say much of the marijuana being grown in northern counties under the states medical pot law is not being used for legal personal use but for sale both in California and states where pot is still illegalThis demand is fueling backyard and largerscale pot farming especially in remote Lake Humboldt and Mendocino counties on the densely forested North Coast officials saidPeople are coming in denuding the hillsides damming the creeks and mixing in fertilizers that are not allowed in the US into our watersheds said Denise Rushing a Lake County supervisor who supports an ordinance essentially banning outdoor grows in populated areasWhen rains come it flows downstream into the lake and our water supply she saidMany affected waterways also contain endangered salmon steelhead and other creatures protected by state and federal lawWildlife biologists noticed streams running dry more often over the 18 years since the state passed Proposition 215 but werent sure whyWe knew people were diverting water for marijuana operations but we wanted to know exactly how much said Scott Bauer the department biologist who studied the pot farms effects on four watersheds We didnt know they could consume all the water in a streamSo Bauer turned to Google mapping technology and satellite data to find out where the many gardens are and how many plants each containedHis study estimates that about 30000 pot plants were being grown in each river system  and he estimates that each plant uses about six gallons per day over marijuanas 150day growing season Some growers and others argue the sixgallon estimate is high and that pot plants can use far less water depending on sizeHe compared that information with government data on stream flows and visited 32 sites with other biologists to verify the mapping data He said most grow sites had posted notices identifying them as medical pot farmsPot farm pollution has become such a problem in Lake County south of Bauers study area that officials voted unanimously last year to ban outdoor growsCounties are the ultimate arbiter of land use conflict so while you have a right to grow marijuana for medicinal use you dont have a right to impinge on someone elses happiness and wellbeing Rushing saidSaying they were being demonized pot users challenged the law and gathered enough signatures to place a referendum on the June 3 ballot They argue that grow restrictions like the ones being voted on in Lake County lump the responsible users in with criminalsWe definitely feel environmental issues are a concern But more restrictive  ordinances will force people to start growing in unregulated and illegal places on public land said Daniel McClean a registered nurse and medical marijuana user who opposes the outdoorgrow banWhile some counties are trying to help regulate the environmental effects of pot farms Bauer hopes his study will lead to better collaboration with growers to help police illegal use of water and pesticidesPrevious collaborative attempts between government and growers have not ended well said Anthony Silvaggio a Humboldt State University sociology professor who studies the pot economyThe county or state gets in there and starts doing code enforcement on other things Silvaggio said Theyve done this in the pastHe said pot farmers believe they are being unfairly blamed for killing endangered salmon while decades of timber cutting and overfishing are the real culpritsHowever the environmental damage has led to a split in the marijuana growing communityOne business the Tea House Collective in Humboldt County offers medicinal pot to people with prescriptions that it says is farmed by small scale environmentally conscious producersPatients who cannot grow their own medicine can rely on our farmers to provide them with the best holistic medicine that is naturally grown sustainable and forever Humboldt the groups website advertisesDespite efforts of some pot farmers to clean things up the increased water use by farms is a fullscale environmental disaster said Fish and Wildlife Lt John Nores who leads the agencys Marijuana Enforcement TeamWhether its grown quasi legally under the states medical marijuana laws or its a complete cartel outdoor drug trafficking grow site there is extreme environmental damage being done at all levels Nores saidOfficials say until the federal government recognizes Californias medical marijuana laws growers will continue to operate clandestinely to meet market demand for their product due to fear of prosecution Meantime enforcing federal and state environmental regulations will be harderIf cherry tomatoes were worth 3000 a pound and consumption was prohibited in most states people would be doing the same thing Nores

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/06/25/us/politics/ap-us-supreme-court-cellphone-searches.html,WASHINGTON   In an emphatic defense of privacy in the digital age a unanimous Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that police generally may not search the cellphones of people they arrest without first getting search warrantsCellphones are unlike anything else police may find on someone they arrest Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court They are not just another technological convenience he said but ubiquitous increasingly powerful computers that contain vast quantities of personal sensitive informationWith all they contain and all they may reveal they hold for many Americans the privacies of life Roberts declared So the message to police about what they should do before rummaging through a cellphones contents following an arrest is simple Get a warrantThe chief justice acknowledged that barring searches would affect law enforcement but he said Privacy comes at a costBy ruling as it did the court chose not to extend earlier decisions from the 1970s when cellphone technology was not yet available  that allow police to empty a suspects pockets and examine whatever they find to ensure officers safety and prevent the destruction of evidenceThe Obama administration and the state of California defending cellphone searches said the phones should have no greater protection from a search than anything else police find But the defendants in the current cases backed by civil libertarians librarians and news media groups argued that cellphones especially smartphones can store troves of sensitive personal informationBy recognizing that the digital revolution has transformed our expectations of privacy todays decision is itself revolutionary and will help to protect the privacy rights of all Americans said American Civil Liberties Union legal director Steven ShapiroUnder the Constitutions Fourth Amendment police generally need a warrant before they can conduct a search The warrant itself must be based on probable cause evidence that a crime has been committedIn the cases decided Wednesday one defendant carried a smartphone while the other carried an older flip phone The police looked through both without first getting search warrantsRoberts said theres no comparison between cellphones and packages of cigarettes and other items that were at issue in the earlier casesA ride on horseback and a flight to the moon both are ways of getting from point A to point B but little else justifies lumping them together he saidAuthorities concerned about the destruction of evidence can take steps to prevent the remote erasure of a phones contents or the activation of encryption Roberts said The police still may seize the cellphone and turn it off or remove its battery If they think that turning it off could trigger encryption when the phone is turned back on police can leave the phone on and place it in a special Faraday bag that isolates the phone from radio waves he saidOne exception to the warrant requirement left open by the decision is a case in which officers reasonably fear for their safety or the lives of othersJustice Samuel Alito joined in the judgment but he wrote separately to say he would prefer that elected lawmakers not judges decide current matters of privacy protection Elected officials are in a better position than we are to assess and respond to the changes that have already occurred and those that almost certainly will take place in the future Alito saidThe two cases arose after arrests in San Diego and BostonIn San Diego police found indications of gang membership when they looked through defendant David Leon Rileys Samsung smartphone Prosecutors used video and photographs found on the smartphone to persuade a jury to convict Riley of attempted murder and other charges California courts rejected Rileys efforts to throw out the evidence and upheld the convictionsThe court ordered the California Supreme Court to take a new look at Rileys caseIn Boston a federal appeals court ruled that police must have a warrant before searching arrestees cellphonesPolice arrested Brima Wurie on suspicion of selling crack cocaine checked the call log on his flip phone and used that information to determine where he lived When they searched Wuries home and had a warrant they found crack marijuana a gun and ammunition The evidence was enough to produce a conviction and a prison term of more than 20 yearsThe appeals court ruled for Wurie but left in place a drug conviction for selling cocaine near a school that did not depend on the tainted evidence That conviction also carried a 20year sentence The administration appealed the court ruling because it wanted to preserve the option of warrantless searches following arrestThe justices upheld that rulingThe decision will protect cellphones from warrantless searches going forward but it may not be of much help to defendants in pending cases or those whose convictions are final said Gerry Morris of Austin Texas a vice president of the National Association of Criminal Defense LawyersMorris said that courts could allow evidence to be used from police searches of cellphones that were done in good faith and relied on the law as it stood when the searches were conductedWhat about other countriesCanadas Supreme Court ruled last year much as the US justices did that officers need a specific warrant to search a computer or a cellphone because the devices give police access to an almost unlimited universe of informationIn Britain however warrantless searches of cellphones and other electronic devices are routine London police stations are even equipped with special devices to suck data from the phones of arrestees as theyre bookedWednesdays cases are Riley v California 13132 and US v Wurie 13212___Associated Press writers Nancy Benac in Washington and Raphael Satter in London contributed to this

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/us/politics/despite-support-in-party-democratic-governors-resist-legalizing-marijuana.html,LOS ANGELES   California voters strongly favor legalizing marijuana The state Democratic Party adopted a platform last month urging California to follow Colorado and Washington in ending marijuana prohibition The states lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom has called for legalizing the drugBut not Gov Jerry Brown I think we ought to kind of watch and see how things go in Colorado Mr Brown a Democrat said curtly when asked the question as he was presenting his state budget this yearAt a time of rapidly evolving attitudes toward marijuana legalization  a slight majority of Americans now support legalizing the drug  Democratic governors across the country Mr Brown among them find themselves uncomfortably at odds with their own baseEven with Democrats and younger voters leading the wave of the prolegalization shift these governors are standing back supporting much more limited medicalmarijuana proposals or invoking the kind of lawandorder and publichealth arguments more commonly heard from Republicans While 17 more states  most of them leaning Democratic  have seen bills introduced this year to follow Colorado and Washington in approving recreational marijuana no sitting governor or member of the Senate has offered a fullout endorsement of legalization Only Gov Peter Shumlin a Democrat in Vermont which is struggling with a heroin problem said he was open to the ideaQuite frankly I dont think we are ready or want to go down that road Dannel P Malloy the Democratic governor of Connecticut which has legalized medical marijuana and decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana said in an interview Perhaps the best way to handle this is to watch those experiments that are underway I dont think its necessary and I dont think its appropriateThe hesitance expressed by these governors reflects not only governing concerns but also several analysts said a historically rooted political wariness of being portrayed as soft on crime by Republicans In particular Mr Brown who is 75 lived through the culture wars of the 1960s when Democrats suffered from being seen as permissive on issues like thisEither they dont care about it as passionately or they feel embarrassed or vulnerable They fear the judgment said Ethan Nadelmann the founder of the Drug Policy Alliance an organization that favors decriminalization of marijuana The fear of being soft on drugs soft on marijuana soft on crime is woven into the DNA of American politicians especially DemocratsHe described that sentiment as Do not let yourself be outflanked by Republicans when it comes to being tough on crime and tough on drugs You will loseIn Washington and Colorado the Democratic governors had opposed legalization from the start though each made clear that he would follow voters wishes in setting up the first legal recreationalmarijuana marketplaces in the nation If it was up to me being in the middle of it and having read all this research and having some concern Id tell people just to exercise caution Gov John W Hickenlooper of Colorado said in a recent interviewIn Colorado where recreational marijuana went on sale Jan 1 revenue figures released in February suggested that taxes on drug sales could bring in more than 100 million a year for the state a figure that made other states take noteWashington has yet to let its first marijuana stores open  that is expected to happen later this spring  but Gov Jay Inslee has made his position clear As a grandfather I have the same concerns every grandfather has about misuse of any drug including alcohol and marijuana he said in a telephone interview adding All of us want to see our kids make smart decisions and not allow any drug to become injurious in our lifeI recognized the really rational decision that people made that criminalization efforts were not a successful public policy Mr Inslee continued But frankly I really dont want to send a message to our kids that this is a route that is without riskGov Andrew M Cuomo of New York has said he would oppose outright legalization of marijuana but would support legalizing to some extent medical marijuana in the state and might be open to decriminalizing the drugIn New Hampshire Gov Maggie Hassan a Democrat invoked her states struggle with heroin abuse in arguing against weakening marijuana laws Legalizing marijuana wont help us address our substance use challenge she said in her state of the state address this year Experience and data suggests it will do just the oppositeEven in California the first state to legalize medical marijuana and where marijuana advocates are moving to put a legalization initiative on the ballot in 2016 Mr Brown has flashed a yellow lightAll of a sudden if theres advertising and legitimacy how many people can get stoned and still have a great state or a great nation Mr Brown said in an interview on Meet the Press last month The worlds pretty dangerous very competitive I think we need to stay alert if not 24 hours a day more than some of the potheads might be able to put togetherThe resistance comes as public opinion on the issue is moving more rapidly than anyone might have anticipated Nationally 51 percent of adults support legalizing the drug according to a New York TimesCBS News poll conducted in February including 60 percent of Democrats 54 percent of independents and 72 percent of young adults Even 44 percent of Tea Party members said they wanted the drug legalizedIn California 60 percent of likely voters said they supported marijuana legalization in a poll conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California last yearIn many ways the shift in public sentiment toward the legalization of marijuana tracks the rapid change in views on samesex marriage again led by young adults and Democrats But there is one key difference Many elected Democratic officials have come to support samesex marriage and analysts said Democrats could pay a political cost for opposing itVery different than gay marriage Kevin A Sabet an opponent of legalization and a cofounder of Project SAM Smart Approaches to Marijuana said in an email People have strong feelings on gay marriage Its a civilhuman rightsreligious issue for both sides Not so with potThere is no obvious political upside to supporting legalization analysts said and politicians as a rule tend to be risk averse You dont hold these positions without having a sense of your own place in history said former Representative Patrick J Kennedy who joined Mr Sabet in founding Project SAM which strives to reduce marijuana use by emphasizing health risks They can honestly see that this is not a good move that its going to have huge consequences not all of which can be foretoldThat said there is little evidence in most states that a politician would pay a price for supporting legalization said Anna Greenberg a Democratic pollster Weve moved into a frame thats not ideological  she said Its about a system being broken not working and that legalization involves strict regulation that would allow the state to collect revenues That makes a lot of sense to the kind of voters that electeds are most concerned about If thats the way its being discussed it isnt a liability for a politicianAt this point the prospects for other elected officials jumping on the legalization bandwagon is likely to depend on what happens as the experiments in Washington and Colorado proceed Among the questions are whether legalization will lead to more drug abuse by teenagers and how much it will fatten state tax coffersI dont tell other governors what to do Mr Hickenlooper said but when they asked me I said If I was in your shoes I would wait a couple of years and see whether there are unintended consequences from what is admittedly a wellintentioned law,2014-04-06T00:00:00Z,drugs

would see the world He didnt expect to end up back in his native Jamaica raising pigs and barely getting by in the poor village of his childhoodThe 43yearold father of two was deported in May 2012 from the US to his Caribbean homeland because he was convicted of a marijuanarelated felony drug charge in 1997  despite the four years he served in the Navy including a few months on a supply ship during the first Gulf WarWeighed down by worry and bonedeep weariness he wants to get back to his family and the future he thought he was building in Virginia Bailey was a teenager when he and his siblings followed their mother to New York City as green card holders and he long considered the United States his homeIts so hard Bailey said gesturing at a few roughhewn pigpens and yam vines climbing up bamboo sticks I went from owning a successful trucking business and two homes in the US paying my taxes raising two beautiful children with a beautiful wife to well what you see hereBaileys case has drawn the attention of immigration lawyers and media because his crime seems relatively minor and the punishment extreme But hes not unique Thousands of noncitizens who served in the US military have been deported to countries around the globe in recent years immigrant advocates estimate The precise number is unknown because the US government does not track deportees by veteran statusSome say the deportees deserve special consideration because of their military service We treated you as a national when you wore the uniform we should treat you as one when it comes off said Pennsylvania immigration attorney Craig Shagin who assists a group for deportees called Banished VeteransIf legal permanent residents die while serving in the US military they are granted a military funeral and citizenship But if they finish their service without becoming nationalized and are later arrested as Bailey was they are subject to immigration laws passed in 1994 and 1996 that expanded the list of deportable offensesIts an uphill battle to return a deportee in Baileys position to the US said Alisa Wellek who is assisting him as coexecutive director of the New Yorkbased Immigrant Defense Project She said a legal advocacy project at Boston College has agreed to file a motion to reopen Baileys immigration case so a judge can determine whether he deserves to stay in the US as a green card holder or legal resident But the Department of Homeland Security will ultimately decide if the case is reopenedUS government officials would not discuss specifics of Baileys situation citing privacy rules Gillian Christensen a spokeswoman for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the agency exercises prosecutorial discretion for members of the armed forces who have honorably served our country on a casebycase basis when appropriateNot everyone sympathizes with foreignborn US military veterans who have been convicted of felonies in civilian lifeMilitary service does not in itself absolve anyone  citizens and immigrants alike  from the consequences of their actions said Ira Mehlman spokesman for the Washingtonbased Federation for American Immigration ReformIn Jamaica Bailey mulls over his stupid mistake and worries about his teenage children a boy and girl living in Virginia Once strong students they are struggling in schoolFollowing his honorable discharge Bailey a communications specialist while in the Navy was studying to become a dental assistant and living near Norfolk Naval Station when he was arrested in 1995 He was convicted in August 1997 of possession of marijuana with intent to distributeBailey said he was duped into the crime by a fellow Jamaican who was serving in the Navy at the time Hanging out near the Norfolk base they bonded over music and he didnt think twice when his new buddy asked him to sign for a couple of packages at his home  But the parcels contained marijuana and was being tracked by law enforcementTwo years later Baily followed his lawyers advice and took a plea deal in Virginia Beach Circuit Court and admitted to a felony possession charge rather than risk a harsher penalty by going to trial He served 15 months in a Virginia lockup and thought that was the end of itBut when he applied for US citizenship in 2005 immigration authorities were flagged by the conviction Bailey was locked up in immigration detention centers for two years until 2012 when he boarded a plane with 70 other shackled Jamaicans and flown to the islands capital on a monthly US flight nicknamed Con AirBailey shares his story with few people in Jamaica where stigma against deportees is high and many people struggle to find work His mother and siblings wire him money because he doesnt make nearly enough to support himself by raising just over a dozen pigsHes still flabbergasted he had to leave the country he vowed to defend His situation keeps him up at night especially his inability to provide for his two children His wife has left him and his marriage is overI made a stupid decision in 1995 I paid for it and then I picked myself up Bailey said his voice thick with emotion as he sat outside a tiny

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/17/nyregion/for-a-much-safer-new-york-bratton-redefines-role.html,In his office on the 14th floor of Police Headquarters William J Bratton displays copies of his memoir Turnaround his account of taming New Yorks crimefilled streets and subways in the 1990s On a mostly empty wall hangs a framed Time magazine cover from 1996 declaring over a steely photo of Mr Bratton Finally Were Winning the War Against Crime Heres WhyThe main crises he describes now six months into his second tour as New York City police commissioner are less likely to bring declarations of victory frayed relations in minority communities a department facing increased oversight the everpresent threat of terrorismHe is acutely aware of predictions that crime would rise in a poststopandfrisk New York run by a liberal mayor Bill de Blasio and Mr Bratton accepts that in many ways his mandate is to bolster public confidence that the city will remain safeA lot of this Mr Bratton said is about effectively trying to just calm everybody down Hey its going to be fine The city is not going to fall apart The four horsemen of the apocalypse are not riding into town to rape and plunderFor a quarter century in police departments on both coasts Mr Bratton has made a name for himself based largely on a broken windows theory of policing an aggressive approach to maintaining order by pursuing lowlevel offenses like vandalism as a means of preventing serious crimeBut on his return to New York he is searching for ways to apply that same playbook developed in the highcrime early 1990s to a safer city filled with New Yorkers who have never known it any other wayHe has looked for blight in Manhattan and found little to report He has marveled that grievances about noise are now a leading complaint from residents in Washington Heights an area he associates with the violent drug gangs of an earlier time Crime is not interestingly enough a big issue at this time in the city he said in a recent interviewThe city is a vastly different place than Mr Bratton knew in the 1990s In 1994 his first year as police commissioner there were 17422 robberies in Manhattan alone and 1561 homicides across the city This year through Sunday there have been just over 7000 robberies citywide and 123 killingsBut Mr Bratton 66 is not veering from his focus on lowlevel offenses Rather he is doubling down although for different reasonsIf two decades ago Mr Bratton championed the zealous pursuit of subway fare beaters he did so partly because it led to the arrest of more serious criminals In those crimeplagued years one in 21 turnstile jumpers was found to have a weapon Now his attention to minor offenses is more about banishing the specter of disorderCrime endures in the city but it often differs from what he faced last time around Heroin is resurgent but users are now more frequently found in Staten Island houses than derelict shooting galleries Youth gangs rarely battle over drug turf but engage in violence for violence sake Mr Bratton has said with a kind of disgusted wonderWhile homicides are down shootings are up 11 percent so far this year to 456 an increase that has been seized upon by his critics and those of the mayorBut in the interview Mr Bratton spoke with evident frustration at how each uptick in violence has been treated as evidence that public safety was slipping Thats something that we had to address and the mayor has to continually keep addressing because everybody is still waiting and watching he saidGod forbid we had 30 more shootings than we had last year he added People tend to forget what this place looked like in the 1990sFor Mr Bratton the present reality is best tackled with what he sees as a timetested approach signaling for officers to go after highly visible conditions such as subway begging and graffiti And he is resisting an effort by the Brooklyn district attorney to be more lenient with lowlevel marijuana offendersHe has even sought to brand the showtime performers who dance in train cars  or as Mr Bratton often calls them the subway acrobats  as resonant symbols of disorder much as he once did with the squeegee men of a generation ago Youre seeing activity directed against the acrobats against the aggressive beggars soaring he saidHe announced with satisfaction the arrest last week of a Long Island man accused of routinely spray painting on highway overpasses and walls in Queens Graffiti along the Long Island Expressway has come under particular scrutiny from Mr Bratton who gets a close view of the vandalism as he returns from his weekend home in the HamptonsI get criticized about What are you going after graffiti for Weve got kids killing each other Mr Bratton said Its just this sense of in public spaces whos in controlWhen he reflects on his policing career Mr Bratton speaks in terms of big challenges he has overcome  helping to turn the tide against crime in New York in the early 1990s and a decade later to remake a Los Angeles Police Department which had come to be defined by brutality and racismHe can seem at times cramped by the challenges enumerated for him by Mr de Blasio who campaigned on reducing and reforming the stopandfrisk tactic the aggressive use of which led to new court oversight and the City Council to create an inspector general for the department While the mayor hailed Mr Bratton as the right leader to carry out changes to the stopandfrisk policy Mr Bratton soon began describing the issue as moot pointing out that by the end of the Bloomberg administration officers had abandoned it as a tacticMr Bratton has also grown quieter about Mr de Blasios signature public safety initiative  reducing traffic deathsWith less fanfare Mr Bratton has embarked on several new initiatives including detectives focused on cellphone theft and cybercrime and a push aimed at those who disable MetroCard machines and sell swipes to desperate straphangersHe said he wants the department to embrace socalled predictive policing which uses data streams to anticipate crime patterns or allocate police resources Already the department is looking back at the hours before every shooting to see which 311 complaints and 911 calls for minor events  loud music playing crowds gathering  preceded the violence and if addressed in the future could help head it offMr Bratton has brought in familiar nonofficers from his past postings John Linder who is working on the reengineering of the department as he did in 1994 John Miller a former reporter to head the departments intelligence and counterterrorism efforts and Zachary Tumin the coauthor of Mr Brattons book on leadership to direct efforts on datadriven policing and social mediaBut one of his most urgent priorities in the wake of the political and legal fight over stopping and frisking has been improving morale in what he describes as an unhappy organizationTo that end he has traveled the city shaking hands with patrol officers adding his signature to their memo books Last month during a latenight tour of the 47th Precinct in the Bronx he stopped by the station house in the neighboring 49th Precinct at 1 am on a whim A lot of my role at this juncture in this department is personal touching of the cops and the public he saidIndeed Mr Bratton is trying to find new ways to improve the publics confidence in the Police Department Soon he said the department will regularly conduct a 10question survey with 200 residents in each precinct to ask the old Ed Koch thing How am I doingAt his direction precinct commanders have taken to Twitter It is part public relations and part responding to citizens everyday complaints to build a better relationship with the publicBut Mr Bratton has also encouraged his precinct commanders to make more decisions on their own potentially leading to conflicts if say the dictates of a computer algorithm do not align with the approach taken by a local commanderA situation like that presented itself in the 47th Precinct during Mr Brattons visit last month when the area was leading the city in homicidesBy design teams of young officers sent to handle crime spikes as part of the decadeold Operation Impact are assigned to highcrime zones determined by analytics at headquarters  and can be moved only after a lengthy approval processBut the commander of the 47th Precinct Ruel R Stephenson said the system limited his ability to respond to pockets of crime as they cropped up around the sprawling precinctAfter the precinct commander described the

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/05/25/us/ap-us-destroying-drug-evidence.html,COLUMBUS Ohio   Cardboard boxes and paper envelopes packed with marijuana cocaine and other drugs line warehousestyle shelves at the State Highway Patrols Ohio crime laboratory where seizures large and small are stored for safekeeping for sometimes years until theyre no longer needed as evidenceThen comes a tricky task How do you destroy it allMost often by incineration but where and how varies according to police spokesmen and officers who oversee evidence Arranging evidence burns can be tricky because rules are different everywhere allowing more leeway in some places than othersPolice have used crematories foundries hospital incinerators or specialized businesses  and even torched drugs in 55gallon drumsTroopers in Ohio used to destroy thousands of pounds of seized drugs  for free  at factories where they could be vaporized in molten steel But the companies worried about it potentially affecting the quality of their product and producing emissions the kind that create environmental concerns and the kind that could skew employee drug tests said Capt David Dicken a director at the crime labIf were throwing 940 pounds of marijuana into the vat you know it flares up he saidTo maintain a dedicated drug destroyer the agency switched last year to a paid contract with a federally permitted company that handles hazardous materialsFederal standards regulate waste incinerators that burn pharmaceuticals but those used only for contraband are exempt from those rules said Dina Pierce a spokeswoman for the Ohio Environmental Protection AgencyVarious local environmental and safety rules can apply creating a complicated regulatory picture for evidencemanagement officers sorting out what destruction methods are allowed said Joseph Latta an instructor and executive director at the Burbank Californiabased nonprofit International Association for Property and Evidence IncDuring the class we say Here are the ways that weve heard of Here are the legal ways Here are some maybe unorthodox ways that weve had to do Latta saidUS Customs and Border Patrol which seizes millions of pounds of illegal narcotics pays contractors to destroy the drugs or turns them over to other agencies such as the Drug Enforcement Agency said Jaime Ruiz a CBP spokesmanDEA destroys marijuana at EPAapproved incinerators because those seizures are generally bulkier and it burns other contraband drugs at its labs said Special Agent Rich Isaacson spokesman for the agencys Detroit divisionIn California where environmental regulations tend to be stricter the legal option is usually limited to EPAapproved energyplant incinerators that operate under emissions and security standards Latta said But reaching those sites could be impractical for smaller more rural law enforcement agencies that take in lesser amounts of drugs he said acknowledging some have probably taken shortcutsIt can be a dilemma for officers who must either arrange for destruction or allow drug evidence to accumulate which risks making the storage area a potential theft target Latta saidOther jurisdictions have more choices State police in the Detroit area use a metal forging plants hightemperature furnace but smaller posts use burn barrels Indiana State Police have similar options Pennsylvania State Police handle drug destruction internally such as with a small incinerator New York State Police use an outside contractor they wont discloseIn West Virginia some authorities may use fire pits state police Capt Joe White saidDrug destruction arrangements with steel facilities still work for some agencies including Columbus Ohio police and the FBIs Cleveland division Cincinnati police are using that option for the first time this year because the university facility they used in the past stopped providing the service department spokeswoman Sgt Julian Johnson saidEspecially when drugdestruction work is pro bono police tend to be tightlipped about details to protect security the businesses involved and sometimes the arrangements themselvesThe word gets out there that this facility does it then 50 other agencies want to go there  and that gets to be too much for that place to handle and then you lose that place And then youve got to go find another one said Sgt Jeff Yaney who oversees evidence for Dayton Ohio policeYaney wouldnt divulge where the department destroys drugs It used to take advantage of the incinerator that burned classified materials at nearby WrightPatterson Air Force Base but the base replaced it with a shredder rather than paying for changes to meet environmental rules a few years agoRepresentatives for two federally permitted hazardous waste incinerators in Ohio Ross Environmental Services Inc near Elyria and the patrols vendor Heritage Environmental Services in East Liverpool said they provide a more controlled secure destruction process with environmental protections and benefits not necessarily found at other types of facilitiesFor that though agencies generally must pay Heritage has destroyed about 10000 pounds of drugs and paraphernalia since July for the patrol at a cost of roughly 22000 said Lt Craig Cvetan a patrol spokesman The funding came from seized drug money which is also used for drug enforcement and drugabuse

NYT,http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/31/this-fugitive-life/,WE have begun to pay attention to the harmful effects that Americas extremely high levels of incarceration have on former prisoners and their families particularly in AfricanAmerican neighborhoods but were still missing part of the story Our gettough turn didnt just send millions of AfricanAmerican men to prison and return them home with felony convictions It expanded the scope of policing and court supervision in poor black neighborhoods radically altering the way life is lived thereIn 2002 during my sophomore year of college I moved into a workingclasstopoor AfricanAmerican neighborhood in Philadelphia and got to know a group of friends in their teens and early 20s who hung out together in the alleyways and on back porches I watched the police stop and search young men in the street chase them make arrests raid houses in the middle of the night and threaten girlfriends and mothers who refused to cooperate I saw the police take young men into custody not only on the streets but at their jobs in their mothers homes at funerals and even in a hospital delivery roomChildren in the neighborhood played games of chase in which one child played the role of the cop The child would push the other child down on the ground and stick his hands in imaginary handcuffs Im going to lock you up Im going to lock you up and you aint never coming home I once saw a 6yearold pull another childs pants down to attempt a cavity searchMost of the young men I met had not finished high school and were struggling to find work They lived with female relatives and some sold drugs off and on Many went to jail or prison but before they went in and after they came home they lived as suspects and as fugitives With pending cases in criminal courts probation and parole sentences to complete or lowlevel warrants out for unpaid court fees or missed court dates they worried that any encounter with the police would send them to prison The threat of capture and confinement had seeped into the basic activities of daily livingA FEW weeks after Eddie turned 14 an officer stopped him outside the corner store patted him down and found a nickel bag of crack in the lining of his jeans When the officer reached for his handcuffs Eddie fled losing the officer in the alleyways In the escape Eddie scaled a fence and landed badly He walked into his grandmothers house panting and clutching his right forearm the bone exposed I had been sitting with his grandmother that afternoon and saw Eddie come through the doorHis grandmother took Eddies shirt off muttered a prayer and examined the woundShould I call for an ambulance I askedEddie shook his head saying that he had no intention of going to the ER The cops there would arrest him for fleeing the police and for possession of narcotics and he was not going to juvenile detention not for this or for anythingBetter that than lose your arm I saidHave you been to juvieNoWhat were you doing selling drugs anyway his grandmother askedEddie shrugged Later he mumbled to me Its not like she can buy groceries every weekAfter an hour or so on the phone his grandmother announced that a woman was coming to fix Eddies armIs she a doctorShes a janitor his grandmother said laughing But she works at the hospitalEddies grandmother spent the afternoon visiting the houses of her friends and relatives trying to raise money She came back that evening looking exhausted with 70 in crumpled billsThe woman arrived around midnight wearing scrubs and carrying a large plastic bag full of medical supplies She unwrapped Eddies arm and injected it with anesthetic As she caught up with Eddies grandmother she cleaned the wound and asked me to turn up the music She instructed his grandmother to hold on to Eddies torso while she clutched his arm between her thighs and set the bone Eddie screamed and struggled to get away then cried for a good 10 minutes The woman dropped two needles into boiling water on the stove and used them to sew up the torn skin Soon Eddies arm sat in a sling and Eddies grandmother handed the woman the 70 along with three plates of chicken and corn breadI met Eddie through Mike the cousin of a high school student I had been tutoring Like her Mike lived in an AfricanAmerican section of Philadelphia but Mikes neighborhood had nicer lawns and larger homesTo white people its all just the ghetto though he saidAbout a month after I met Mike the cops raided his uncles house in the middle of the night Mike who was 22 at the time had slept at his girlfriends that night and his uncle called there around 4 am to tell him to leave immediately since they would probably come to her place next Mike was wanted on a shooting charge though he denied being involved in any shooting or even owning a gunWith a warrant out for his arrest Mike spent the next few weeks hiding in the houses of friends and relatives and trying to raise money for his defense Then he paid a lawyer and turned himself in He was held at a large pinkandgray jail in Northeast Philadelphia After a fight in the yard Mike spent a week in solitary confinement and his mother scraped together the money to pay his bailWho knows how long he will last in the darkness like that she said as we walked out of the bail officeMike came home and began attending monthly court dates I had never known a man facing criminal charges before and assumed this was a grave and significant event in Mikes life As we approached the local courthouse Mike recognized a man he knew and smoked a cigarette with him while they exchanged details about their cases By the time we were sitting on the benches on the defendants side of the courtroom he had greeted over a dozen more young men He recognized two of the public defenders and told me which guys from the block had been assigned to them for various casesI began to understand that Mikes shooting charge though not insignificant for him was nothing new  not to him or the other guys he grew up with His best friend Chuck was in county jail awaiting trial for a schoolyard fight and another close friend Alex was completing two years of parole after serving a year upstate for drugs Mikes cousin was out on bail his neighbor was living under house arrest Another friend who was homeless and sleeping in an abandoned Jeep had a warrant out for unpaid court fees These young men were coming of age in courtrooms jail visiting rooms and prison cellsNear the end of my sophomore year I asked Mike what he thought of my writing about his life He agreed and then I asked other young men and their families to take part My junior year Mike Chuck and I became roommates I spent the rest of college and then four years of graduate school in the neighborhood writing daily notes On the weekends wed visit incarcerated friends in prisons across Pennsylvania Wary that my writing might generate new charges for Mike and his friends we picked out pseudonyms and a new name for the neighborhoodWhen I give talks about this research people sometimes ask whether young men selling drugs and getting into violent disputes dont deserve a difficult life Im never quite sure how to answer this question Sometimes I simply tell storiesTims first arrest came at age 11 One of his older brothers Mikes friend Chuck was driving Tim to school in his girlfriends car and when a cop pulled them over the car came up as stolen in California Chuck had never been to California and had no idea which one of his girlfriends relatives had stolen the car The officer took both brothers into custody Down at the police station they charged Chuck with receiving stolen property and they charged Tim as an accessory to the crime Later a judge in juvenile court placed Tim on three years probationMikes first arrest had come at 13 when the police stopped searched and arrested him for carrying a small quantity of marijuanaChuck made it all the way to 18 without any jail time but during his senior year he got into a schoolyard fight with someone who called his mom a crack whore The guy wasnt severely injured but the police charged Chuck with aggravated assault He sat in county jail while the trial dates dragged on coming home eight months later the assault charge dropped The next fall he tried to reenroll as a senior but by then he was 19 and the school secretary would not admit him He could not afford the court fees that came due after his case closed so he ended up with a bench warrant out for his arrestArent these precisely the young men committing the violent crimes ruining poor neighborhoods people ask Surely the innocent public should be protected from this criminal element Yes I say in theory But the division between innocent victims and violent offenders simply does not hold up in this neighborhood where poor young men without work are both the most frequent perpetrators and the most frequent victims of the violence In the time I lived there we lost a number of young men to shootings and the guys I knew were on both sides of those conflictsThe question we might also ask is not whether an individual should be punished for an act of violence but where this violence is coming from and how we might prevent it Often when older people in the neighborhood talked about the troubling levels of violence they blamed bad parenting absent fathers or a lack of moral fortitude in the younger generation Maybe all this is true but from what I observed the roots of crime and violence were also found in economic hardship and in particular a profound dislocation from the legal labor marketSome of the saddest days I spent in the neighborhood were the days that Mike Chuck and their friends searched for work Watching them try and fail day after day to secure lowpaying parttime jobs broke my spirit Once after months of putting in applications Chuck became too exhausted and too hungry and asked another man for some crack to sell As he cut it and placed it into little baggies he seemed to get more and more upsetAre you OKI hate this I seen what it did to my mother I hate doing that to other peoples mothers Like Im causing their painYeahAnd I know Im probably going right back to jailYeahBut what am I supposed to do I need to eat Tim needs to eatThe deep employment problems of AfricanAmerican young men cannot be solved through police work or prison sentences They predate the war on crime and may well survive it But if we want young men like Chuck and Mike to end their reliance on an underground illegal trade for income and employment we must address the chronic joblessness that they face As long as the drug trade continues to sustain a large portion of poor AfricanAmerican communities we will see a level of violence there that no resident or outside observer feels is acceptablePolicy analysts sometimes look at a neighborhood like this one and conclude that the main problem is one of police legitimacy This sanitizes the intense conflict going on between the police and the residents of poor minority communities In these neighborhoods the problem is not that the police lack legitimacy the problem is that residents who are already struggling with acute poverty joblessness and drug addiction are living under daily threat of arrestWhatever our opinion about Mike or Chucks guilt or innocence we might agree that a criminal justice system that arrests an 11yearold boy for sitting in the passenger seat of a stolen car or makes a 14yearold boy scared to seek medical treatment for a severe injury is not working for the public good Perhaps we might also agree that requiring young men to avoid their mothers houses their workplaces and their friends funerals in order to stay out of jail is also misguidedIn this Philadelphia neighborhood the agencies charged with providing justice and safety were instead sources of fear and instability Locking up large percentages of AfricanAmerican young men is morally wrong and immensely costly but creating a shadow world of police surveillance and fugitive living is perhaps equally harmful and ultimately selfdefeatingCan we imagine a world in which the police in poor communities act not as an occupying force to use Mikes mothers phrase but instead as mediators of disputes people residents can turn to for help and support without fear of going to prison If we stretch ourselves even further can we imagine the police connecting residents to jobs and social services rather than disconnecting themPeople on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of the courtroom now acknowledge that the criminal justice system needs a major overhaul After four decades of zero tolerance and getting tough on crime we seem poised for change Can we seize the momentAlice Goffman an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin Madison is the author of On the Run Fugitive

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/05/03/world/americas/ap-lt-uruguay-mujica-.html,MONTEVIDEO Uruguay   Uruguay has finally released its rules for the legal marijuana market it is launching this year detailing how the government plans to get very involved in every aspect of the business But anyone hoping the South American nation will become a potsmokers paradise should probably head to Colorado instead President Jose Mujica suggested on FridayIts a complete fiction what they do in Colorado in terms of controlling the sale and use of legal marijuana Mujica said in an Associated Press interviewColorado licenses sellers and producers but allows any adult to buy up to 28 grams at a time  and then go down the street and buy 28 grams more In Uruguay consumers must be licensed as well and each purchase will be tracked to ensure they buy no more than 10 grams a week he saidMujica and his ministers plan to sign the regulations on Monday and theyll take effect on TuesdayIn two weeks the government will take applications from businesses hoping to become one of a handful of growers supplying marijuana to the state By early December a network of pharmacies will be ready to supply the weed to registered consumers at less than a dollar a gram presidential spokesman Diego Canepa said late FridayAs with tobacco the pot will come in packages warning of health risks and smoking will be prohibited everywhere but private homes and openair locations As with liquor motorists will be subject to testing by police to make sure theyre not driving under the influenceThe state will sell five different strains containing a maximum level of 15 percent THC the substance that gets consumers high Each bag will be barcoded radiofrequency tagged and registered in a genetic database that will enable authorities to trace its origin and determine its legality Canepa said  The rules limit licensed growers to six plants per household  not per person as some pot enthusiasts had hoped And while people who buy in pharmacies will be identified by fingerprint readers to preserve their anonymity every users pot consumption will be tracked in a government databaseMujica predicted that many will call him an elderly reactionary once they see this fine print but he says his government never intended to create a mecca for marijuana loversNo addiction is good he said We arent going to promote smokefests bohemianism all this stuff they try to pass off as innocuous when it isnt Theyll label us elderly reactionaries But this isnt a policy that seeks to expand marijuana consumption What it aims to do is keep it all within reason and not allow it to become an illnessWith bona fide plants registered at the molecular level police can test for illegal weed wherever they encounter it and arrest anyone with pot that lacks the proper genetic markers the rules sayMujica says the system is more transparent and honest than the medical marijuana laws passed by 21 US states and the District of Columbia which he called brutal hypocrisy because people can fake illnesses to get prescription weedThere are places where there are forms already filled out with a doctors signature So you go you say that you need marijuana because your ear hurts they fill out the form you prescribe it yourself and with the signature of a doctor he saidMujica who is preparing to visit President Barack Obama in the White House on May 12 predicted that Uruguays system will be much tougher on drug users and more effective in combatting illegal drug traffickingMujica says his government will license and regulate the entire marijuana business enforcing pot possession rules as well as limits on production and sales so that violators get punished and addicts get helpUruguays leader sat down for a wideranging AP interview in his garden after a quick ride in his Volkswagen Beetle with his wife Sen Lucia Topolansky to the butchers shop to buy some meat for dinner He answered questions surrounded by chickens cats and dogs at the small farm on a hill overlooking Montevideo where he lives and grows flowers for saleIts a critical time for Mujica and the ruling Broad Front coalition which has staked its reputation on outcompeting traffickers and treating marijuana more as a problem of public health than law enforcementMujica also is negotiating with Obama over Guantanamo He says he wants to help close the US detention center by taking some prisoners but wont agree to Washingtons demand to keep the former terror suspects inside UruguayThey will be able to move freely They can leave But theyve been turned into walking skeletons Theyve been destroyed by what theyve gone through physically and psychologically Mujica said He declined to say more to avoid complicating the talks Weve made our proposal Its the United States that has to decideMujica is a former guerrilla who led the armed Tupamaro movement before Uruguays 19731985 dictatorship He was jailed throughout the junta years mostly in solitary confinement Now he not only leads his country hes an international celebrity after making passionate speeches against the consumerism and greed Those speeches  and the marijuana plan  have earned Mujica a Nobel Peace Prize nomination this year,2014-05-03T00:11:48Z,drugs

Texas set up a warehouse to grow more than they would ever need And three people buying pot in a grocery store parking lot are robbed at gunpointWhile no one expected the states firstinthenation recreational sales would eliminate the need for dangerous underground sales overnight the violence has raised concerns among police prosecutors and pot advocates that a black market for marijuana is alive and well in ColoradoIt has done nothing more than enhance the opportunity for the black market said Lt Mark Comte of the Colorado Springs police vice and narcotics unit If you can get it taxfree on the corner youre going to get it on the cornerIts difficult to measure whether there has been an increase in potrelated crimes beyond anecdotal reports because no one at either the federal or state levels is keeping track of the numbers of killings robberies and other crimes linked directly to marijuanaPot advocates say the state is in a transition period and while potrelated crimes will continue they will begin to decline as more stores open and prices of legal marijuana declineIts just a transition period activist Brian Vicente said Marijuana was illegal for the last 80 years in our state and there are some remnants of that still around Certainly much like alcohol over time these underground dealers will fade awaySales are due to begin in June in Washington where authorities will be watching for similar casesTheres going to be a black market here said Cmdr Pat Slack of the Snohomish Regional DrugGang Task Force which covers an area outside Seattle There will be drug ripoffs and drug debts that havent been paid All of that is going to stayUnder Colorados voterapproved law it is legal to possess up to an ounce of marijuana Authorities are concerned that means illegal dealers and buyers believe they can avoid prosecution These dealers and their customers also tend to be targets if robbers know they are flush with cashArapahoe County outside Denver has seen a growing number of drug rips and outright burglaries and robberies of people who have large amounts of marijuana or cash on them said District Attorney George BrauchlerHis district has seen at least three homicides linked to pot in recent months and a rising number of robberies and home invasionsAmong them was a February case in which a 17yearold boy said he accidentally shot and killed his girlfriend while robbing a man who had come to purchase weedElsewhere prosecutors say Nathaniel Tallman 25 was killed during a January drug deal when he was robbed and shot and his body dumped in WyomingThe next month a dealer mugged three people who were trying to buy marijuana from him in a Denver grocery store parking lotSuch deals are the exception said Vicente The average customer prefers to buy in a welllit regulated store he said citing the roughly 2 million Colorado made in marijuana taxes in January aloneWhether dangerous or not it can still be cheaper to buy pot from a drug dealerVoters who approved recreational sales in Colorado also agreed to a 129 percent state sales tax and a 15 percent excise tax on it Local jurisdictions can also add their own taxes Medical marijuana is taxed too but at a much lower rate  a 29 percent sales taxThose taxes mean an ounce of pot can go for 400 or more at a statesanctioned store depending on quality and potency An ounce on the street can run between 200 and 280 depending on how much a dealer wants to profit Comte saidUnderground dealers also are not burdened by complex regulations and licensesThose barriers to entry already create the potential for the black market and then you add these taxes on top of it and it makes it impossible to get rid of said Denver attorney Robert Corry who helped write the pot legalization measure but opposed the taxesCorry who has long represented marijuana dealers facing criminal charges said his clientele has hardly diminishedComtes unit recently searched a warehouse where two men from Texas were growing so much more than they could ever need he said Detectives charged them with possession of pot with intent to distributeIf some Colorado drug dealers have lost business to legal retailers some also have made up for it by transporting weed to other statesA Lakewood man was arrested in March after postal inspectors intercepted a package he was mailing containing a pound of pot Drug task force officers who later searched his home found scores of gallonsized bags of marijuana and 76 plantsMarijuana cases can be hard to prosecute and are not costeffective so police often prefer to focus attention on drugs like heroin and methamphetamine Comte saidOne result he said is the feeling among illegal dealers that because retail sales are legal authorities are looking the other wayMark Kleiman a public policy professor at the University of California Los Angeles who is helping Washington set up its legal marijuana industry said the black markets survival has less to do with taxes than with a shortage of legal storesColorado has more than 160 statelicensed stores but they remain concentrated in the Denver area Many towns dont have anyWhen there are more stores and more products in the stores and prices settle down then well see Kleiman said I would be very surprised if the illicit market can compete at

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/world/europe/britains-new-immigrants-from-romania-and-bulgaria-face-hostilities.html,LONDON   Three days after Andrei Opincaru a 29yearold Romanian arrived in Britain this year police officers saw him smoking a cigarette on the street They stopped searched and questioned him about having marijuanaI asked them What are you doing You cannot do this to me Youre treating me like a criminal he recounted The officers he said laughed and went away To them it was just a joke he saidMr Opincaru came to Britain in hopes of landing a good job by taking advantage of newly extended employment rights for workers from Romania and Bulgaria which were among the latest entrants to the European Union But Mr Opincaru like other newcomers was surprised by how little his European citizenship did to shield him from an intense political backlash against the employment measureThe tension became more apparent last month when Nigel Farage leader of the UK Independence Party expressed discomfort at the idea of having Romanian neighbors suggesting there was a high level of criminality among Romanians in Britain This is not to say for a moment that all or even most Romanian people living in the UK are criminals he said But it is to say that any normal and fairminded person would have a perfect right to be concerned if a group of Romanian people suddenly moved in next doorIn an interview with LBC Radio Mr Farage whose wife is German was pressed on whether he would feel uncomfortable with German neighbors I think you know the difference he replied We want an immigration policy that is not just based on controlling not just quantity but quality The independence party known for an antiimmigration stance won about a quarter of the vote in last months election for European Parliament membersMr Opincaru who found a job in construction shares an apartment with four Italians and two Portuguese who also came to London for work But he and other Romanians say they are made to feel like secondclass citizens more so than the migrants from affluent countries in Western Europe despite having equal legal rights One bank refused to let him open an account he said though he provided all the required documents and had secured a job and a national insurance number  the equivalent of a Social Security numberBeing a Romanian in Britain is very very difficult Mr Opincaru said Theyre not treating us like other citizens from Europe he added Wherever you go and they hear youre Romanian they change the musicWhen the European Union extended full employment rights to Romania and Bulgaria this year allowing workers there free movement throughout Europe nationalist politicians warned there would be a flood of desperate immigrants who would take jobs from native workers Headlines predicted a surge in crime and cheating on benefits One Conservative politician Philippa Roe said the arrival of Romanians and Bulgarians would escalate problems like beggingIn November the government froze loans and other financial support for thousands of Romanian and Bulgarian students as a precautionary measureBut the figures published last month did not reflect an influx of migrants from the two countries The number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in Britain from January to March of this year dropped to 140000 from 144000 in the previous quarter according to the Office for National Statistics That compared with 17 million migrants from the rest of the European Union working in Britain it saidAnd not everyone has been unwelcoming The Muswell Hill Baptist Church in London has set up a charitable organization to help Romanian migrants We should respond to them as European citizens not per nationality said Martin Stone who leads the program We should grow up and not lower ourselves to petty nationalism We know where fingerpointing has led to in the pastPart of the antipathy today stems from previous decisions to allow unfettered immigration from Poland and seven other Eastern European countries immediately after they joined the European Union in 2004The number of native Poles in Britain has grown tenfold since and today they are the second largest immigrant population just behind Indians and ahead of Pakistanis who have colonial links to BritainThis year the government tightened rules for migrants seeking benefits Migrants may not seek jobless benefits for three months after their arrival and they must show weekly earnings of at least 255 before they can apply for child care unemployment housing or health care

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/05/02/world/americas/ap-lt-uruguay-mujica.html,MONTEVIDEO Uruguay   President Jose Mujica says Uruguays legal marijuana market will be much better than the system in Colorado which doesnt track the drug after sale And he says the medical marijuana laws many US states have adopted are based on hypocrisy because they enable people to fake illnesses to get prescription weedMujica also predicted Friday that Uruguays system will be much tougher on drug users and more effective in combatting illegal drug traffickingMujica who will visit President Barack Obama in the White House on May 12 says his government will license and regulate the entire marijuana business enforcing pot possession rules as well as limits on production and sales so that violators get punished and addicts get helpIn an exclusive Associated Press interview just hours before the release of Uruguays longawaited marijuana regulations the former leftist guerrilla also predicted that many will call him an old reactionary once they see the fine printWe dont go along with the idea that marijuana is benign poetic and surrounded by virtues No addiction is good he saidWe arent going to promote smokefests bohemianism all this stuff they try to pass off as innocuous when it isnt Theyll label us elderly reactionaries But this isnt a policy that seeks to expand marijuana consumption What it aims to do is keep it all within reason and not allow it to become an illnessUruguays rules which Mujica plans to sign Monday will take effect on Tuesday The plan calls for disseminating clones of governmentapproved marijuana plants so that police can test weed possessed by licensed users and ensure that its bona fide Possession of marijuana lacking the genetic markers of approved plants will be criminally punishedMujica said its a complete fiction what they do in Colorado which licenses marijuana sellers and producers but allows any adult to buy up to 28 grams at a time In Uruguay consumers must be licensed as well and each purchase will be tracked to ensure they buy no more than 10 grams a weekMujica also criticized the medical marijuana laws passed by 21 US states and the District of Columbia There are places where there are forms already filled out with a doctors signature So you go you say that you need marijuana because your ear hurts they fill out the form you prescribe it yourself and with the signature of a doctor This is brutal hypocrisyMujica sat down for an AP interview in his garden after a quick ride in his Volkswagen Beetle with his wife Sen Lucia Topolansky to the butchers shop to buy some meat for dinner He answered questions surrounded by chickens cats and dogs including a greyhound someone recently abandoned at the small farm on a hill overlooking Montevideo where he lives and grows flowers for saleIts a critical time for Mujica and the ruling Broad Front coalition which has staked its reputation on outcompeting traffickers and treating marijuana more as a problem of public health than law enforcementMujica also is in sensitive talks with Obama over Guantanamo He says he wants to help close the US detention center by taking some prisoners but wont agree to Washingtons demand that the former terror suspects be kept inside UruguayThey will be able to move freely They can leave But theyve been turned into walking skeletons Theyve been destroyed by what theyve gone through physically and psychologically Mujica said He declined to say more to avoid complicating the talks Weve made our proposal Its the United States that has to decideMujica described Obama as a progressive leader whose hands and feet are tied by powerful forcesThat Obama won the presidency was a surprise and within the limits of the US political system practically an abortion It broke with all logic he said But the way that politics have prevented him from doing anything fencing him in so he cant do anything so that his legacy will be that there was a black president but he didnt do anything  they are ferocious FeROcious I think theyre screwing with the North American people with those of their people who are least valuedMujica is a former guerrilla who led the armed Tupamaro movement before Uruguays 19731985 dictatorship At the time the Tupamaros were sworn enemies of the South American military powers supported by US President Richard Nixon and his secretary of state Henry KissingerMujica was jailed throughout the junta years mostly in solitary confinement Now he not only leads his country hes an international celebrity after making passionate speeches against the consumerism and greed Those speeches  and the marijuana plan  have earned Mujica a Nobel Peace Prize nomination this year and many are eager to hear Mujica speak alongside Nobel Peace Prize winner ObamaMujica said hell focus on business and inviting US teachers to Uruguay But foreign relations will come up tooThey have made so many mistakes These Americans have spent an enormous amount of money on Latin America Most of it went to those who need it least Instead of armies political intervention and embassy work what we Latin Americans need is to raise our heads and our technical abilities he said The way the US is going  down the road of arrogance and armies  I think theyre going to lose influenceObama has ruled out legalizing pot nationwide but has not interfered with Uruguays marijuana plans State Department official Roberta Jacobsen said Wednesday that theres an honest debate on the issue and that Obama should get more credit for budgeting more than 10 billion a year on drug prevention and treatment You cant arrest your way out of this problem she said,2014-05-02T15:04:43Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/us/missoula-montana-homeowner-shoots-teenager-in-garage.html,MISSOULA Mont   Teenagers call it garage hopping The goal was to sneak into an open garage steal some beer or other items and slip away into the night It was dumb and clearly illegal It was not supposed to be deadlyAround midnight on April 27 a 17yearold exchange student from Germany named Diren Dede left the host home where he played Xbox and drained cans of Sprite to set off with a friend through his dark hillside neighborhood They passed a home whose garage door hung partially open Using a cellphone for light Mr Dede headed inInside the house motion sensors alerted Markus Kaarma 29 to an intruders presence Two recent burglaries had put Mr Kaarma and his young family on edge his lawyer said and he grabbed a shotgun from the dining room and rushed outside He aimed into the garage and according to court documents fired four blasts into the dark Mr Dedes body crumpled to the floorWhile Mr Kaarma has been charged with deliberate homicide Mr Dedes death has set off an outcry an ocean away in Germany exposing the cultural gulf between a European nation that tightly restricts firearms and a gunloving Western state In his defense Mr Kaarma is expected to turn to laws enacted in Montana five years ago that allow residents more legal protections in using lethal force to defend their homesGerman consular officials have called for justice In an interview with a German news agency Mr Dedes father criticized what he called an American cowboy culture as contributing to his sons death In Mr Dedes hometown Hamburg hundreds of his stunned relatives friends and soccer teammates attended memorials holding photos of Mr Dede and unfurling a banner that read Our brother is dying while America is looking onIn Montana which has one of the countrys highest rates of gun ownership the killing has renewed criticism of the states castle doctrine laws which allow residents wider latitude to use force to defend their homesNearly every state has a law on the books giving residents the legal right to defend their homes but Montana is among several that have gone further With backing from the National Rifle Association and the support of the states Democratic governor Montana passed a stronger law in 2009 that placed the burden on prosecutors to rebut claims of selfdefenseUnder the old laws residents were justified in using force only if an assailant tried to enter their home in a violent riotous or tumultuous manner The new law eliminates that language and makes it clear that residents can use force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent an assault on themselves or someone else in the homeThese laws are expected to play a crucial role in the criminal case that has been filed against Mr Kaarma who is out on bond and is to be arraigned Monday His lawyer Paul Ryan says Mr Kaarma feared for his familys safety and panicked that nightHe doesnt know whos there what theyve got anything Mr Ryan said He just didnt know what was going on Then he started to shootThe shooting has also focused political attention on the castle laws State Representative Ellie Boldman Hill a Democrat from Missoula has proposed repealing the recent changes saying that the rules have fostered a shootfirst culture in MontanaIm a liberal legislator from Montana and I have a handgun in my closet she said We are proud of our gunowning tradition but enough is enough Its like a license to kill People are walking around exercising vigilante justiceSteve Daines a Republican congressman running for the United States Senate recently told a veterans group he supported the laws as they stand a view echoed by gun enthusiasts His opponent Senator John Walsh a Democrat supports them as wellGary Marbut president of the Montana Shooting Sports Association said I think its working just fineIn times of emergency in Montana Mr Marbut said the police are often an hours drive away Selfdefense is a natural right It is part of the nature of being a free person that your life has value and you can protect that life Its just not going to work to change Montana to a Chicagostyle cultureBut here in Missoula a liberal college town ringed by snowcapped peaks Mr Dedes classmates and neighbors as well as other residents have expressed sympathy for him and tried to distance their community from the bloody events of that night Scores of people attended a vigil for Mr Dede and ribbons bearing the red gold and black of the German flag hang around nearly every mailbox post in his neighborhood a winding subdivision where deer leap through backyards and children play driveway basketball at duskThis is not us said Randy Smith one of Mr Dedes host parents Its not our neighborhood its not our country Its not MontanaIt was Mr Dedes first trip to the United States and his teachers and friends host family and soccer coach said he had seemed to thrive here He played on two soccer teams and was so devoted to the sport that he insisted on attending a grueling team run up a mountainside on his first night in MissoulaThe son of Turkish immigrants he often talked about straddling two cultures and listened to German hiphop and Turkish pop music on his phone He took trips to Hawaii and Yellowstone and talked about wanting to return here to crisscross the country in a motor homeBut just up the road two recent burglaries had made Mr Kaarma and his partner Janelle Pflager feel like targets inside their home Mr Kaarmas lawyer said Someone had entered their open garage  the couple kept it open so they could duck out to smoke cigarettes  and stolen a wallet and credit cards Mr Ryan the lawyer said The breakins rattled the couple who are firsttime parents with a 10montholdTheyre feeling invaded Mr Ryan said They thought they were being watched in their own neighborhoodMs Pflager bought motion sensors and a video camera to track the intruders should they return and put a purse with some marked belongings inside so that they could be traced to anyone who stole them Mr Ryan said the purse was sitting in the back of the garage and had not been placed there to lure anyone inA hairstylist named Felene Sherbondy told the police that Mr Kaarma had come into the Great Clips salon three days before the shooting and talked about how he had been waiting up with his shotgun for three nights to shoot some kid Ms Sherbondy told the police that Mr Kaarma was being extremely vulgar and belligerent according to court documentsMr Kaarma told the police that in the moments before Mr Dedes death he heard the sound of metal touching metal as he stared into the pitchblack garage and swept the gun across the width of the garage as he fired Ms Pflager told the police she heard a few yells of Hey or Wait from inside the garage and then gunshots It all happened in less than 10 seconds the couple told the policeThey did not see who was in the garage until it was all over Mr Ryan said The friend accompanying Mr Dede that night an exchange student from Ecuador stayed outside the homeThe police are investigating whether Mr Kaarma was under the influence of marijuana or other substances at the time of the shooting Investigators found a glass jar of marijuana in his kitchen pantry according to a searchwarrant application filed in the case A neighbor also told the police that Mr Kaarma smoked marijuana in the garage and that marijuana and marijuana pipes had been stolen in one of the earlier burglariesInvestigators have tested Mr Kaarmas blood for drugs but the results have not been released Mr Ryan said that Mr Kaarma had also been tested for alcohol use after the shooting and that those results were negative Mr Dedes host parents Mr Smith and Kate Walker who say they have never locked their doors and have never been burglarized have spent the last week grieving for a 17yearold who had begun to feel like a family memberWhatever happened to

NYT,http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/morning-agenda-pfizer-lets-astrazeneca-go/,Pfizer said on Monday that it had abandoned its bid for AstraZeneca bringing an end to a monthslong takeover effort that would have created the worlds largest drug company Jenny Anderson writes in DealBook The decision  made on the final day for Pfizer to decide whether to abandon the deal  came in the wake of AstraZenecas rejection of what Pfizer called its final offer earlier this month The cashandstock bid valued AstraZeneca at about 119 billionPfizer had indicated that it would not pursue a hostile bid which would have allowed AstraZenecas shareholders to vote on the deal without the approval of AstraZenecas board Under British takeover rules Pfizer cannot come back with another offer for AstraZeneca for six months The bid by Pfizer ignited debate on both sides of the Atlantic over corporate taxes cancer research and the potential effect on jobs in BritainThat Pfizer was unable to use its vast clout to woo its smaller rival whose performance had been less than spectacular is a coup for AstraZeneca Ms Anderson writes AstraZeneca is now under pressure to achieve the ambitious performance targets that it revealed in defense of its bid to stay independentNYU CRISIS IN ABU DHABI STRETCHES TO WALL STREET  Martin Lipton the superlawyer has advised hundreds of boards of directors in the midst of crises Now however Mr Lipton is grappling with a board governance crisis of his own Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column As chairman of New York Universitys board of trustees Mr Lipton has been dealing with revelations that the universitys new campus in Abu Dhabi might have been the product in part of rights abuses of foreign laborersHours after The New York Times published an article detailing those conditions Mr Lipton sent an email to some members of NYUs board which is stacked with Wall Street bigwigs including Laurence D Fink of BlackRock the hedge fund impresario John A Paulson and a Home Depot founder Kenneth G Langone The email said that he had been unaware of the reported abuses In a memo later that day the universitys president John Sexton tried to create distance between NYU and the contractorBut this was a red herring Mr Sorkin writes The general contractor that helped oversee the construction of the campus is run by a trustee of NYUs

Blackstone and the other private equity partnerships in the transaction this deal will be a gift that keeps giving Gretchen Morgenson writes in The New York Times In addition to a share of gains from the sale as well as management fees the private equity firms will also share in an estimated 30 million in monitoring feesThe Securities and Exchange Commission has been taking an increasing interest in private equity especially in their fees Monitoring fees like those in the Biomet deal are a source of particular concern at the SEC because of their ubiquity Ms Morgenson writes Portfolio companies generally agree to monitoring for 10year increments but when a company is sold usually after about five years the monitoring fees for the remaining years of the contract must still be paidMs Morgenson writes Ultimately investors are the ones who lose out when companies pay these fees Each dollar that a portfolio company pays in fees is one less dollar that it can invest in its operations thereby

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/05/20/world/middleeast/20reuters-lebanon-cannabis.html,BEKAA VALLEY Lebanon Reuters  Driving around his Bekaa Valley farmland Ali Nasri Shamas carries a revolver by his side and an automatic rifle in the back of his car weapons he says hes ready to use if the army moves in to try to destroy his lucrative cannabis cropBut he may not need them this year With Syrias civil war raging 30 miles 50 km away Lebanese security forces have other priorities than their annual showdown with the Bekaa hashish growersIf they want a confrontation thats no problem for us it will be harvest season soon Shamas says standing in a field of the green spikyleafed plants from which hashish resin is extractedIn recent years security forces have sent tractors bulldozers and armored vehicles to plough up flatten or burn the cannabis crops leading to clashes with farmers armed with assault rifles and rocketpropelled grenadesDramatic as they were those shows of force by authorities achieved only partial success in a region where the state holds limited sway and even the militant Shiite group Hezbollah is reluctant to confront formidable local clansSince 2012 the campaign has been quietly shelvedTwo years ago farmers blocked roads when security forces started burning cannabis The government backed down and the interior minister promised to look into compensating farmers for crop eradication and finding them alternative sources of income pledges the farmers say have not been honoredLast year as violence spilled over the border from Syrias civil war  with bombs and gunfights in Lebanons coastal cities and rockets striking towns in the Bekaa  authorities called a halt to a battle they had waged with farmers since the end of Lebanons own 19751990 civil warDuring that war the fertile Bekaa Valley produced up to 1000 tonnes of cannabis resin annually before it was briefly stamped out under a United Nations programme between 19911993From the 1990s until 2012 cannabis eradication took place on an annual basis said Colonel Ghassan Shamseddine head of Lebanons drug enforcement unitBut in 2012it was halted because of the situation on the Lebanese borders and the instability in Syria he said in an interview in BeirutCALLS FOR LEGALIZATIONShamas has grown a variety of crops in his 135 acres 54 hectares of fields including barley wheat onions and potatoes But cannabis provides by far the best returnsIts also a hardy crop well suited to withstand the unusually dry winter which Lebanon suffered this year without the need for expensive irrigationIt costs between 100 and 150 to cultivate one dunum a quarter of an acre or tenth of a hectare much less than a field of wheat At harvest time in late summer farmers can get up to 3000 per dunumWith hashish no one loses says Shamas who has planted more of it as a portion of his overall crop in recent yearsThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ranked Lebanon in 2011 as one of the worlds top five sources of cannabis resin Shamseddine said official figures suggested the total area of cannabis planted has remained constant over the last three years at around 35000 dunums though it has fluctuated sharply in the preceding yearsIn 2005 a tumultuous year when Syrian forces ended their 29year military presence in Lebanon 64000 dunums were planted That fell to 11000 by 2010 the year before Syrias uprising erupted and Lebanon slipped towards domestic turmoilThe long and inconclusive campaign against the cannabis crop combined with recent moves to legalize the drug in two US states has led some prominent Lebanese to add their voices to the farmers calls for cultivation to be legalizedVeteran Druze leader Walid Jumblatt  insisting he had never smoked marijuana  said last month he supported growing cannabis for medicinal use arguing that regulated crop cultivation would improve living conditions in poorer areas of the Bekaa ValleyEconomist Marwan Iskander said fully legalizing the cannabis crop would help Bekaa and another impoverished part of Lebanon the northern Akkar region as well as contributing 400 million to the state budget and 2 billion to the wider economy at a time when Lebanon is struggling with the fallout of Syrias warAt this stage it would have a big impact he said Lebanon needs this farming and needs to revive the Bekaa and Akkar regionsWhile conceding the idea was unlikely to gain widespread support he said he had floated it to senior United Nations and World Bank officials in Beirut They didnt say at the outset that this is going too far he saidREADY TO FIGHTIn practice Shamseddine says that as long as the drug control efforts take second place to containing the spread of Syrias conflict into Lebanon cannabis cultivation will be seen to be officially tolerated at least by the farmersEvery year that passes without eradication encourages people he saidShamas said authorities should take a step further and formally recognize cannabis as a legal crop  a move he said would have benefits for allWe dont like cultivating cannabis by force and making problems he said When the state legalizes it and gives licenses as they do for tobacco cultivation we would abide by that and the state would receive revenues from usRegardless what stance officials take Shamas said he will continue sowing more and moreEvery year weve planted cannabis and every year weve increased the area which weve planted The year they destroyed it we promised them we would plant five times that amountIf they want to legalize it well thank them If we knew that the state was looking after us we wouldnt lift a gun towards a soldier he said But if anyone from the states gangs fights us we will fight backEditing by Peter

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/business/13-deaths-untold-heartache-from-gm-defect.html,BEN WHEELER Tex  For most of the last decade Candice Anderson has carried unspeakable guilt over the death of her boyfriend He was killed in 2004 in a car accident here and she was at the wheel At one point Ms Anderson who had a trace of Xanax in her blood even faced a manslaughter charge She was 21All these years Ms Anderson  now engaged and a mother  has been a devoted visitor to his grave She tidies it every season sweeping away leaves and setting down blue daisies with gold glitter for his birthday miniature lit trees for Christmas stones with etched sayings for the anniversary of their accidentIts torn me up Ms Anderson said of the death of Gene Mikale Erickson Ive always wondered was it really my faultLast week she learned it was notMr Erickson 25 was one of the 13 victims whose deaths General Motors has linked to an ignition switch defect that can cause a loss of power in cars according to an email that Mr Ericksons mother Rhonda received from the National Highway Traffic Safety AdministrationMs Erickson asked the federal agency whether her son was among the 13 victims at the request of The New York Times which has compiled the identities and circumstances of 12 of the deaths as well as information about the vehicle involved in the 13th based on interviews accident databases and communications from federal regulatorsThe email to Ms Erickson last week was the first time the family had been told that anything other than negligence by Ms Anderson contributed to the accidentI was angry  at him and at Candice for a little bit Ms Erickson said of her son and his girlfriend at the time both of whom had experimented with various recreational drugs Then you find out that it wasnt them being so careless The car malfunctioned and they didnt have a choiceEver since GM first began recalling 26 million small cars with the defective ignition switch in February the company has refused to disclose the names of the victims or details of the accidents  even to some survivors of the crashes and relatives of the dead GM also has not shared its interpretation of the data from the socalled black boxes that helped the automaker identify the 13 deaths leaving some local and state investigators to draw their own conclusions  often erroneously  about the crashesIt is the largest number of deaths formally linked to an auto safety issue in the United States since the recall of Ford vehicles with Firestone tires in 2000 NHTSA has tentatively identified 51 deaths related to postcollision fires that resulted in a 2013 recall of some of Chryslers Grand Cherokee and Liberty models but that investigation remains openInside GM the nations largest automaker some of the 13 victims appear on charts and graphs with a date and a single word fatalOutside in police files and state highway patrol records they are the subjects of accident investigations tragic but mostly unremarkable some involving alcohol inexperienced drivers or failure to wear seatbeltsThe Times found that the 12 victims died in 10 separate accidents in nine states and Canada the earliest on July 4 2004 the latest less than a year ago on June 22 2013 They ranged in age from a 13yearold to an 81yearold All but one of the accidents were singlecar crashes in which the driver lost control and slammed headon into an obstacle usually a tree In every case the air bags did not deployWhen presented with the victims names compiled by The Times GM would neither confirm nor deny them We are not publicly identifying victims out of respect for families privacy Greg Martin a company spokesman said in an email He added Out of respect for their privacy we do not discuss private conversations that we may have had with familiesSome relatives of the victims say that the automaker has refused to even communicate privately about the accidents and that they suspect the companys secrecy has more to do with containing its legal liabilityIt would have been nice if they had acknowledged it at least to us said Margie Beskau whose daughter Amy Rademaker was killed in an October 2006 crash in Wisconsin and is among the 13 GM has just been hiding behind lawyers through this whole thingSome law enforcement officials say the information the automaker withheld might have changed their investigations In all GM now acknowledges that the defective ignition switch contributed to at least 47 accidents a recent revision from its earlier tally of 32 including those that caused the 13 deathsPeter Asplund a former state police trooper in Texas who responded to the accident here involving Ms Anderson said that had he known about the ignition flaw in essence that would change everything Victims in the DarkThe issue of a potential coverup hangs heavily over GM The company has acknowledged that as early as 2001 it had evidence that the ignition switch could if jostled suddenly shut off the power in a moving car disabling air bags and impeding braking and steering systems The Justice Department the Securities and Exchange Commission two congressional committees and a group of state attorneys general are all investigating whether GM misled the public and federal safety regulatorsCongressional investigators have compiled an incomplete list of the fatal crashes linked to the flaw  some entries contain only the month and year of an accident with no names  and there have been various efforts to fill in the missing pieces The Times identified the 12 victims by following the criteria GM has indicated in public statements and documents and by conferring with various people who have knowledge of the list including safety regulators in the United States and Canada as well as elected officialsGM officials have said that they counted only deaths from frontimpact crashes for which black box data confirmed that air bags did not deploy an indication that the ignition had been turned off and the power lost Illustrating the limitations of those parameters in an accident that killed Amy Rademaker in Wisconsin another teenage girl died as well but the company did not count her death presumably because she was riding in the back seat where there were no air bagsIn at least half of the accidents surviving family members received payments from GM four of them through court settlements and at least one through a claim that was resolved as part of the companys 2009 bankruptcy process Lawyers say the ignition switch defect was not identified in the litigation as a contributing factor It was not disclosed by GM until a deposition taken last year in a separate Georgia case involving a death that the company does not link to the defective switchThe families would not discuss the precise terms of their settlements  most are subject to confidential terms  but some said the payments were not large and the process was sometimes unpleasant Those attorneys dragged my son through the mud and he wasnt even there to defend himself said Ms Erickson mother of the man killed here in Texas in 2004 In 2008 GM settled the suit she brought against the automakerIn fighting lawsuits and in its public statements GM has pointed to other factors that could have been responsible for the deaths All of these crashes occurred offroad and at high speeds where the probability of serious or fatal injuries was high regardless of air bag deployment the company said in February when it had acknowledged only six deaths tied to the defect In addition failure to wear seatbelts and alcohol use were factors in some of these casesIn fact The Times found alcohol was listed as a factor in just four of the 10 accidents that the newspaper identified  including one in which the drunken driver was actually driving another vehicle that crashed into the defective GM car The driver of the GM vehicle a Chevrolet Cobalt was Esther Matthews 73 who was killed along with her granddaughter Grace Elliott 13 Her 1yearold greatgrandson survived but was paralyzed from the accidentGM has not indicated how it will compensate the families of the 13 dead or the relatives of other victims who might be added to the list Federal safety regulators said last week that it was likely that more than 13 lives were lost and GM has not ruled out that the tally would increase In the next few weeks Kenneth R Feinberg the victimcompensation expert hired by GM is expected to unveil a plan for addressing the thousands of claims filed against the automakerBlaming the DriverThe day of the accident Ms Anderson was driving Mr Erickson to retrieve his car from a friends house before he went to welding school It was just before noonOn a peaceful Texas country road flanked by tall grass and fencedoff pastures of cows she lost control of her beige Saturn Ion with zebraprint seat covers At a slight curve the pair rode straight off the road and into a tree Neither was wearing a seatbeltAt least an hour went by before a passing driver heard Ms Andersons cries and bushwhacked through briers to reach the couple The blood on Ms Andersons face and hands had dried and the car had settled on top of her legsIn a written statement to the police the passing driver Greg Norrell described Ms Anderson as intermittently hysterical but otherwise in control of her faculties and responsive I noticed both of her pupils were focused and not dilated he wroteMr Ericksons body lay in Ms Andersons lap She kept shaking his head saying Baby wake up  Mr Norrell saidWhen a state trooper Mr Asplund arrived on the scene he saw the lack of skid marks on the road as a sign that no evasive action was taken by the driver according to his report and put the blame squarely on Ms AndersonIve gone out there and looked at the scene so many times said Ms Anderson who has no memory of that day It doesnt make sense Why would I not be able to make the tiniest little sway to the rightThe trooper attributed the collision to drugs I believe that Anderson was intoxicated at the time of the accident he wrote Her intoxication resulted in the accident which resulted in the death of Gene Mikale EricksonHe had found an empty film canister coated with white residue and smelling of marijuana in the car and he had interviewed Mr Ericksons mother about her son and his girlfriends drug use which was as recent as the night beforeThe analysis of Ms Andersons blood sample showing only a small amount of Xanax barely over the detectable limit was not yet completed when she was charged with intoxication manslaughter At the scene Mr Asplund wrote she was incoherent and seemed delirious with a blank look on her faceThe next morning he visited Ms Anderson in the hospital where she remained for a week recovering from internal injuries and broken limbsAnderson did not answer any of my questions but insisted that she did not know what happened during the accident or anytime surrounding the accident he wrote Anderson repeatedly stated I killed him and would begin sobbingA grand jury indicted her Her parents liquidated their 401k to retain a defense lawyer for her Three years after the accident she pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide The district attorney agreed to the deal only after Ms Erickson wrote a letter asking for leniency Ms Anderson was fined and sentenced to five years probation Im glad she didnt do any time in prison said Mr Asplund who has since left his job in law enforcement The intentional coverup of the ignition that upsets meReceiving ForgivenessMs Ericksons small brown farmhouse where her son also lived is less than a mile from the site of the accident A decade later she still takes a longer route into town to avoid that subtle curveI have memories all around me she said fresh tears welling up during an interview on the 10th Mothers Day weekend without her sonMr Ericksons two daughters from a previous relationship are now 14 and 16 The elder Siara has her fathers bright red hair and both have his athleticism having learned to play softball with his mittThis year for the first time since the accident Siara spoke with Ms Anderson who had reached out to apologize Siara extended both girls forgivenessMs Erickson too has forgiven her sons former girlfriend She has watched Ms Anderson mature she said  avoiding drugs settling down with her current fianc eight years ago and starting a familyI would love to see Candice be able to have some peace from this Ms Erickson saidStill Ms Erickson is racked by complicated emotions about the accident unable to bring herself to buy a headstone for her sons grave She has set aside the money 2400  and has even designed a headstone with a smiling picture of himFor Ms Anderson it is all about not forgetting even as her life has moved onThe thing that scares me about death is that people forget you and I dont want people to forget him Ms Anderson said This is something Im not ever going to be done with,2014-05-27T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/07/us/medical-marijuana-providers-fear-effects-of-wider-legalization.html,SEATTLE   There should be one might think a note of triumph or at least quiet satisfaction in Muraco Kyashnatochas voice Her patientbased cooperative in north Seattle dispenses medical marijuana to treat seizures sleeplessness and other maladies And with the state gearing up to open its first stores selling legal marijuana for recreational use the drug she has cultivated provided to patients and used herself for years seems to be barreling toward the mainstreamBut her oneword summary of the outlook for medical marijuana is anything but sunny Disastrous she said standing in her shop Green Buddha which she fears she will soon have to closeThe legalization of recreational marijuana for adults in Washington approved by voters in 2012 and now being phased in is proving an unexpectedly anxious time for the users growers and dispensers of medical marijuana who came before and in many ways paved the way for marijuanas broader acceptanceIn the 16 years since medical marijuana became legal here an entire ecosystem of neighborhood businesses and cooperative gardens took root with employees who could direct medical users to just the right strain there are now hundreds of varieties with names like Blue Healer Purple Urkle and LA Confidential each with a variety of purported medicinal benefits Medical users could also start gardens in their backyards and keep large amounts of marijuana at home It was all very folksy  and virtually unregulated which the authorities say led to widespread abusesNow under pressure from the federal government the state is moving to bring that loosely regulated world with its echoes of hippie culture into the tightly controlled and licensed commercial system being created for recreational marijuana which goes on sale this summer The first license to grow marijuana was issued on Wednesday This week the Legislature is debating bills that would reduce the amount of the drug that patients can possess or grow eliminate collective gardens under which most dispensaries operate require medical users unlike recreational users to register with the state and mandate that all marijuana be sold only by new licensees effectively shutting down the medical dispensary systemProponents say the changes are needed to stamp out fraud and help ensure that Washington has a uniform system supplying the medical products people need and want while at the same time passing muster with guidelines issued by the federal government last summer even though marijuana remains illegal under federal law But many medical marijuana users and dispensary owners say the rules will inadvertently discourage the legitimate use of marijuana to treat illness and pain even as science has increasingly been validating its therapeutic effectsTrusted dispensaries will be closed they contend and choices will diminish with the varieties that marijuana medical users prefer squeezed off the shelves by more profitable recreational varieties grown for their greater highproducing THC content not for headache or nausea relief In Seattle alone about 200 dispensaries will have to close replaced by 21 licensed retailers and under current state regulations employees in those shops will not be allowed to even discuss the medical value of the products for saleA medical marijuana user will certainly be able to enter a shop and buy marijuana once the new stores are open in June but the old system of medical advice and supply however flawed or beloved is over say both critics and supporters of the new rulesPrepare for the end said Hilary Bricken a lawyer in Seattle who works mostly with the marijuana industry summarizing the advice she is giving her medical marijuana dispensary clientsWashington States struggles  and the inevitable comparison with Colorados different smoother path toward retail marijuana  are being watched around the nation Ms Bricken and other legal experts saidCalifornia for example with a medical marijuana system far larger but otherwise similar to Washingtons in its absence of state controls also has active voterinitiative efforts pushing toward legalization Twenty states as well as the District of Columbia allow medical marijuana and at least 14 more are considering some form of it this year Oregons Legislature is wrestling with how to administer its dispensary system even as efforts continue to put legalization on the ballotColorado avoided trouble mostly by acting early There state regulators stepped in with strict rules for medical marijuana long before full legalization And after voters approved legalization in 2012 those regulated dispensaries were put first in line for licenses forming the backbone of the new recreational market The dispensaries had supplies of the product in the pipeline  and expertise  which is why recreational marijuana sales started there from the first day of legalization on Jan 1 while Washingtons are still weeks awayIn Washington some dispensaries might be well run others poorly but without oversight state officials could not know which was which So a clean sweep was seen as the only way forward legislators sayWere moving from the wild wild West to the regulated West said State Senator Ann Rivers a Republican and a sponsor of one of the leading bills A similar bill sponsored by a Democrat from Seattle Representative Eileen Cody passed the House last monthMs Rivers emphasized that her goal was to protect not punish marijuana patients though she said she understood their fear of change Without formalized rules allowing patients to continue growing their own plants for example I502 the initiative legalizing recreational marijuana prohibits that and to have more than one ounce in their possession arrest and federal prosecution are a real risk she asserts Her bill allows bothA mandatory registry she said provided the legal spine to those protections Under her bill a registered patient buying medical marijuana at a licensed store with an endorsement from the state to sell medical marijuana would also be exempt from the 25 percent retail tax charged to recreational buyers Other state taxes assessed on growers and producers would already be included in the retail priceThe feds have been very clear that if we dont get our ducks in a row they are going to bring it to a screeching halt Ms Rivers said We have a chance right now to define our destiny with this and if we dont we will most definitely allow the feds to define our destinyTo many patients and providers though the proposed mandatory registry is not a good thing Some patients especially those receiving Social Security or other federal aid have said they will refuse to sign up because that would be a legal admission of drug use that they said could jeopardize their benefits Others have told lawmakers they fear a loss of private informationSome dispensary owners concede that the medical system was rife with abuses but that patients were now about to pay the priceThe state failed to regulate allowing doctors to write these prescriptions to 20yearold gangbangers on the street who said Oh I hurt my knee playing basketball said Karl Keich a dispensary operator and founder of the Seattle Medical Marijuana Association a group of collective gardensAndrea Mayhan who takes medical marijuana to control muscle spasms and seizures that she suffers as a result of a degenerative disorder says she believes she will be able to get the strains of marijuana she wants because she knows what to ask for New patients though might walk in  or like her roll in using their wheelchairs  and find a clerk less familiar with medical strains or prohibited

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/27/us/momentum-is-seen-as-more-states-consider-legalizing-marijuana.html,A little over a year after Colorado and Washington legalized marijuana more than half the states including some in the conservative South are considering decriminalizing the drug or legalizing it for medical or recreational use That has set up a watershed year in the battle over whether marijuana should be as available as alcoholDemonstrating how marijuana is no longer a strictly partisan issue the two states considered likeliest this year to follow Colorado and Washington in outright legalization of the drug are Oregon dominated by liberal Democrats and Alaska where libertarian Republicans hold swayAdvocates of more lenient marijuana laws say they intend to maintain the momentum from their successes heartened by national and statewide polls showing greater public acceptance of legalizing marijuana President Obamas recent musings on the discriminatory effect of marijuana prosecutions and the release of guidelines by his Treasury Department intended to make it easier for banks to do business with legal marijuana businessesTheir opponents though who also see this as a crucial year are just as keen to slow the legalization drives They are aided by a waitandsee attitude among many governors and legislators who seem wary of pushing ahead too quickly without seeing how the rollout of legal marijuana works in Colorado and WashingtonWe feel that if Oregon or Alaska could be stopped it would disrupt the whole narrative these groups have that legalization is inevitable said Kevin A Sabet executive director of Smart Approaches to Marijuana which is spearheading much of the effort to stop these initiatives We could stop that momentumDespite the drug still being illegal under federal law the Obama administration has said it will not interfere with the rollout of legal marijuana in the states for several reasons including whether the state is successful in keeping it out of the hands of minorsAt least 14 states  including Florida where an initiative has already qualified for the ballot  are considering new medical marijuana laws this year according to the Marijuana Policy Project which supports legalization and 12 states and the District of Columbia are contemplating decriminalization in which the drug remains illegal but the penalties are softened or reduced to fines Medical marijuana use is already legal in 20 states and the District of ColumbiaAn even larger number of states at least 17 have seen bills introduced or initiatives begun to legalize the drug for adult use along the lines of alcohol the same approach used in Colorado and Washington but most of those efforts are considered unlikely of success this yearThe allure of tax revenues is also becoming a powerful selling point in some states particularly after Gov John W Hickenlooper of Colorado said last week that taxes from legal marijuana sales would be 134 million in the coming fiscal year much higher than had been predicted when the measure was passed in 2012In Rhode Island which is struggling financially national and local advocates for legalization say the Colorado news is sure to help legislation introduced in February to legalize the drugSome feel its not an appropriate issue for an election year and others want to wait and see what happens in Colorado said State Senator Joshua Miller a Democrat who is sponsoring the Rhode Island legalization law But a lot of other people are very anxious to take the revenue part of this very seriouslyOpponents of legalization meanwhile are mobilizing across the country to slow the momentum keeping a sharp eye on Colorado for any problems in the rollout of the new law thereLegalization almost had to happen in order for people to wake up and realize they dont want it Mr Sabet said In a strange way we feel legalization in a few states could be a blessingCalifornia had been considered a possibility to legalize marijuana this year through a ballot proposition  one to do just that failed in 2010  but the Drug Policy Alliance which had been leading the effort decided this month to wait until 2016While much of the recent attention has focused on these legalization efforts medical marijuana may also cross what its backers consider an important threshold this year  most notably in the South where Alabama Georgia and South Carolina are among the states considering such lawsJohn Morgan an Orlando lawyer whose firm includes former Gov Charlie Crist has spent 36 million of his own money to get a medical marijuana initiative on the November ballot in Florida where a Quinnipiac University poll conducted in November showed that eight in 10 Florida voters support medical marijuana State law requires 60 percent to passMr Morgan insists that his initiative is not intended to help Mr Crist a Republican turned Democrat reclaim the governorshipElection data compiled by Just Say Now a promarijuana group showed that the percentage of the vote that came from people under 30 increased significantly from 2008 to 2012 in states that had marijuana initiatives This youth vote predominantly Democratic rose to 20 percent from 14 percent in Colorado and to 22 percent from 10 percent in Washington both far above the 1 percent rise in the national youth voteIf it benefits Charlie Crist its certainly an unintended consequence Mr Morgan saidMr Sabet said his conversations with Democratic leaders around the country convince him that there is little enthusiasm for being highprofile on the issue For the moment I think by and large Democrats are uncomfortable with that Mr Sabet saidIn Maryland though the marijuana issue is already playing a role in the governors race where all three leading Democratic candidates are talking about how much and how fast to ease marijuana laws not whether to do it at allA narrow majority of Americans  51 percent  believe marijuana should be legal according to a New York TimesCBS News poll conducted last week matching the result in a CBS News poll the previous month In 1979 when The Times and CBS first asked the question only 27 percent wanted cannabis legalizedThere were stark differences in the new poll though While 72 percent of people under 30 favored legalization only 29 percent of those over 65 agreed And while about a third of Republicans now favored legalization this was far below the 60 percent of Democrats and 54 percent of independents who did soIn Alaska sufficient signatures have been collected to get the legalization initiative on the ballotAlaska is a red state but with a heavy libertarian streak said Taylor Bickford spokesman for the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol in Alaska The idea of personal freedom and responsibility is uniting Alaskans on both sides of the aisleUnder state law however the vote will occur during the Aug 19 primary not in the general electionThe support in Alaska is very strong but how do you poll on an issue like this for a lowturnout primary election asked Ethan Nadelmann executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance That is why he thinks Oregon really has the better chance this yearAnthony Johnson the director of New Approach Oregon a coalition that is leading the drive there said advocates are trying to persuade state legislators to put the issue on the November ballot while simultaneously preparing to collect the roughly 88000 signatures that would be needed to force it onto the ballot if the legislators demurAt the moment Id say the odds are no better than 50 percent that the Legislature will act Mr Johnson said But if they dont we will just gather the signatures I am pretty confident we will be able to get themMason Tvert director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project a leading advocate for legalizing marijuana said campaigns were already underway to stage aggressive legalization drives in several states over the next couple of years including Arizona California Maine Massachusetts Nevada and possibly MontanaIt is certainly important to maintain the momentum Mr Tvert said But I dont think we can look at any one election cycle and see what the future holds This is going to be a multiyear effort,2014-02-27T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/11/us/politics/social-issues-splitting-young-republicans-from-their-elders.html,OXON HILL Md   It was difficult to miss Ian Jacobson at the Conservative Political Action Conference Known as Rooster he was 33 with an ample beard earrings and a towering orangeandaqua spiked Mohawk haircut But he also sported a pinstriped suit French cuffs and a natty contrast collarMr Jacobsons sartorial contradictions matched those of his politics He is among the young Republicans who are profree market on fiscal issues and libertarian on social ones While his views represent a potential growth wing for a party that is losing among other demographic groups they also show an emerging tension with the older social conservatives at the core of the partys baseI want us to return to our roots Mr Jacobson said while attending the conference over the weekend A selfdescribed libertarianleaning Republican from San Antonio he sketched out his ideal political party as one that freed individuals to chart their own course in their personal and professional livesHe had a ready assessment of his partys opposition to samesex marriage and legalization of marijuana Its ridiculous its timeconsuming and its taking focus away from where it should be  on economic issuesWhile much attention has been devoted to the split between the establishment and the Tea Party the growing divide along generational lines among Republicans could cause a significant a rift Younger conservatives are more firmly staking out a libertarian orientation on social issues in a way that will shape the 2016 presidential primary as candidates seek to appeal to activists who are in the party because of social issues and to younger voters who see some aspects of cultural conservatism as intolerantThat young people regardless of party prefer a liveandletlive approach on social issues is nothing new In 2012 President Obama defeated Mitt Romney by 23 points among 18 to 29yearolds in part because of the presidents more liberal cultural views But what is increasingly alarming to some cultural conservatives is that it is not just young Democrats who share those views  and that this youthful libertarianism is not fading when the Republicans of tomorrow graduate from collegeIn a recent New York TimesCBS News poll 56 percent of Republicans under age 45 indicated support for samesex marriage rights compared with just 29 percent among older Republicans That split was on display at CPAC an annual conclave of some of the partys most conservative activists The split did not take place among the highprofile presidential candidates who largely avoided divisive social issues or mentioned them only to praise their partys bigtent tolerance but the conversation was easy to find elsewhereThis is the civil rights issue of the 21st century Alexander McCobin 27 the head of a libertarian student group said about samesex marriage during a panel titled Can Libertarians and Social Conservatives Ever Get Along Mr McCobins statement elicited both applause and a smattering of groansI think it was very much a generational difference too he said later adding a warning to Republicans They need to start embracing libertarian issues or its going to start really hurting them in electionsHe said it was time for social conservatives to recognize a shifting society People can be socially conservative in their private activities without trying to impose their views on other people said Mr McCobin who leads Students for LibertyWhat is striking is that even some young social conservatives who do not want their party to abandon its platform on culture say Republicans would deemphasize those issues Anna Page 19 a Wellesley freshman attending CPAC said support for samesex marriage was now a matter of pure statistics among millennialsIf the party wants to move forward and appeal to our generation they have to appeal to the majority to succeed Ms Page saidZach Pohl an Ohio State junior who was strolling through CPAC wearing a Russianstyle winter hat with OBAMA and the Soviet hammer and sickle emblazoned on it said he was not really moved by the samesex marriage issueReligiously I dont agree with it but at the same time I dont really care Mr Pohl saidLeading social conservatives worry about the rise of libertarianism or apathy on social issues in the ranks of young Republicans Former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania a cultural conservative acknowledged that libertarian social views were no longer confined to freespirited college Republicans but were taking root among conservatives in their 30s and 40sMr Santorum said that after he speaks to youthful audiences they give him feedback about how they had not previously heard his case about the importance of cultural conservatism as it relates to the centrality of the familyThey dont hear it from pop culture they dont hear it from the media they dont hear it from anybody unless theyre going to church and even in church now theyre not hearing it in a lot of churches said the once and perhaps future presidential candidate So when youre only hearing one side of the argument its pretty easy to be convincedMr Santorum said Republicans should not abandon their social conservative base but rather should take a lesson from Pope FrancisYoung people love him right Mr Santorum said Has he changed his position on marriage has he changed his position on life No A lot of this is about what were for not what were againstWhile views on samesex marriage highlight an obvious division in the party there is also a widening generational gap when it comes to marijuana Half of Republicans and Republicanleaning independents under 45 support legalizing the drug while twothirds of Republicans over 45 oppose making pot legal according to the  TimesCBS News pollPeople view it as a waste of government resources explained Gabriel Sachs 19 and a Purdue University sophomore about keeping marijuana outlawed Were sending people to jail for this drug that doesnt really hurt anyoneMr Sachss profile illustrates the new Republican vanguard He supported Mr Romney for president and likes his partys stance on the minimum wage and taxes but he is exasperated at Indiana legislators for trying to enact a ban on samesex marriage He is also active in his campuss chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws or NormlThe older folks have their beliefs and I think its kind of ingrained in the party but I think as more young Republicans come out and vote hopefully the tide changes he said in a recent interview on campusThere is no division however on the issue of abortion with young and old opposed in almost equal numbers Still younger Republicans are more willing to support a candidate who does not share their position on abortion than those over 45 according to the pollRachael Dobi 21 a junior at Geneva College a Christian school in western Pennsylvania described herself as very conservative on cultural issues But she urged Republicans to focus on areas with broader appeal to young votersTheres more to the Republican Party than gay

Keene from the violent monopoly of government and its enforcers including these parking officers who work in weather fair and foulThe mundane matter of parking has become so contentious that a third

contentious that the mayor the city manager and the city attorney all declined even to say hello to meBut some local residents are speaking out in their stead by challenging the activists through a Facebook page with the unwieldy name of Stop Free Keene One of its organizers Andrea Parkhurst Whitcomb is asking the relative newcomers a fundamental questionWho asked you to come free usThe activists selected this New Englandcute city of 24000 for liberation mostly because it lies within that flinty bastion of Yankee individualism known as New Hampshire where Live Free or Die is carved into the collective graniteBack in 2003 a libertarianleaning group called the Free State Project decided that this small state could be a liberty lovers paradise if enough likeminded people settled here The movement by the way tends to attract white males according to Carla Gericke the groups president a white South African who has lived for many years in this country Im the token AfricanAmerican she jokedA dozen years in the Free State Project is about threequarters of the way toward achieving its goal of having 20000 people commit to relocating to the state after which it will trigger the move The project has already influenced the statewide conversation at times  partly because of early movers like Ian Freeman a Floridian who bought an old white duplex on Leverett Street several years ago and quickly set out to push local buttonsThere have been marijuana gatherings in the central square Makebelieve drinking of alcohol at City Council meetings Leafleting outside public schools And many videorecorded encounters in which the activists are the earnest heroes of their own narratives holding accountable the employees of a government they do not generally recognizeIn one notorious instance a grandmotherly crossing guard smacked at their camera with her stopsign placardThe gangly Mr Freeman born Ian Bernard drives an auctionedoff police car with Wisconsin plates hasnt paid federal taxes for a decade and has donated his house to the recently established Shire Free Church which is now seeking taxexempt status From this parsonage he broadcasts his nationwide Free Talk Live radio show several nights a weekMr Freeman 33 has been repeatedly arrested and once served 58 days in jail for disorderly conduct after standing in front of a police car to protest a womans arrest because she had an open can of beer He is guided he says by his voluntarist belief that all human interaction should be consensual which might surprise the human parking officers who do not consent to being followed or videotapedThis shadowing of parking enforcement officers has received the most publicity by far Videotapes show the officers being dogged by activists who sometimes goad with pleasantries like How do you live with yourselfAfter the officers complained about skyrocketing stress last year the situation became even more surreal with Keene hiring a private investigator to follow and videotape the activists following and videotaping the parking enforcers The city then filed a legal complaint against several activists including Mr Freeman accusing them of harassment and seeking a buffer zone between activist and parking officerThey would try to make comments to bait me about my faith about my military status Alan Givetz the exsoldier recalled

I couldnt take it anymore he said I didnt see an end in sightMr Freeman denied that he and his colleagues have harassed anyone But he noted that enduring verbal and mental abuse is part of the officers job description If its too stressful he said maybe its not the right job for youJames Cleaveland an accountant who helped to popularize Robin Hooding in Keene sounded like a dental surgeon when he said that as he videotapes the officers I try to make it as comfortable as I can Still he said My ultimate mission is to prevent the state from getting involved in other peoples livesBut there are reasons the state uses parking meters tickets and even tow trucks according to Gary Lamoureux Keenes project manager for parking and the only city official to comment Its to have turnover for the business owners in the downtown area he said In other words to support the marketplaceIn December a Cheshire County Superior Court judge cited freespeech protections in dismissing the citys complaint as well as its request to be reimbursed for costs that included therapy sessions for the officers The activists celebrated a victory in the courts they disdain the city appealedMr Freeman said that some in the larger Free State Project disapproved of his tactics believing that they might alienate New Hampshire residents before the group has made clear its purpose But he has no remorse he said Weve brought millions of dollars of press coverageMs Gericke the projects president said that we want to be good productive neighbors who dont want to poison the well But she added that Robin Hooding in Keene is evolving and has become a great means of outreachFreedom is messy she saidMr Freemans movement has inspired many to take up activism  against him The Stop Free Keene Facebook page has seen

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/04/29/us/politics/ap-us-supreme-court-cellphone-searches.html,WASHINGTON   The Supreme Court seemed wary Tuesday of allowing police unbridled freedom to search through cellphones of people they arrest taking on a new issue of privacy in the face of rapidly changing technologyThe justices appeared ready to reject the Obama administrations argument that police should be able to make such searches without first getting warrantsA key question in two cases argued Tuesday is whether Americans cellphones with vast quantities of sensitive records photographs and communications are a private realm much like their homesPeople carry their entire lives on their cellphones Justice Elena Kagan saidThe issue involving devices now carried by almost everyone is the latest in which the court is being asked to adapt old legal rules to 21stcentury technological advances We are living in a new world Justice Anthony Kennedy saidThe court heard arguments in cases involving a drug dealer and a gang member whose convictions turned in part on evidence found on their cellphonesThe justices suggested they might favor limiting warrantless cellphone searches to looking for evidence of the crime on which an arrest is based Both defendants could lose in such an outcomeMore broadly however a decision imposing restrictions on the searches could avoid subjecting people arrested for minor crimes to having all the contents of their cellphones open to police inspection And it might also prevent the police from using the phones to connect to the Internet and any information stored onlineIf police were to arrest someone for driving without a seat belt Justice Antonin Scalia said it seems absurd that they should be able to search that persons iPhoneThe Supreme Court has previously ruled that police can empty a suspects pockets and examine whatever they find to ensure officers safety and prevent the destruction of evidence The Obama administration and the state of California defending the searches said cellphones should have no greater protection from a search than anything else police findBut the defendants in these cases backed by an array of civil libertarians librarians and news media groups argued that cellphones especially smartphones are increasingly powerful computers that can store troves of sensitive personal informationJeffrey Fisher representing gang member David Leon Riley of San Diego said even a limited ruling could have profound implicationsI think you will fundamentally have changed the nature of privacy that Americans fought for at the founding of the republic and that weve enjoyed ever since Fisher saidThe issue is of more than passing concern for many people More than 90 percent of Americans own at least one cellphone the Pew Research Center says and the majority of those are smartphones More than 12 million people were arrested in the US in 2012 according to FBI statisticsUnder the Constitutions Fourth Amendment police generally need a warrant before they can conduct a search The warrant itself must be based on probable cause evidence that a crime has been committed But in the early 1970s the Supreme Court carved out exceptions for officers dealing with people they have arrestedSeveral justices expressed concern about applying rules written 40 years ago to a rapidly evolving technologyHow do we determine what the new expectation of privacy is Justice Samuel Alito askedJustice Department lawyer Michael Dreeben repeatedly warned the court about unduly restricting officers when they seize a phone saying they might need to act quickly to evade encryption that could render the device impregnable If officers are forced to get a warrant and the phones protection is activated Dreeben said It may be months or years or never before officers can break through that encryptionHe also argued that cellphones are important devices in the commission of crimes a point picked up by Kennedy People who are breaking the law are more dangerous more sophisticated more elusive with cellphones Kennedy saidBy contrast Fisher urged the court to regard cellphones generally as extensions of the home where privacy protections are greatestIn the two cases Riley carried a Samsung smartphone while Brima Wurie of Boston had a less advanced flip phoneProsecutors used video and photographs found on Rileys smartphone to persuade a jury to convict him of attempted murder and other charges Officers who arrested Wurie on suspicion of selling crack cocaine checked the call log on his flip phone and used that information to determine where he lived When they searched Wuries home armed with a warrant they found crack cocaine marijuana a gun and ammunitionThe justices expressed varying levels of sophistication about cellphones Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Sonia Sotomayor Kagan and Alito seemed most comfortable talking about the technology They are perhaps not coincidentally the four youngest justicesOn the other hand 75yearold Justice Stephen Breyer who is given to selfdeprecation on the bench gamely tried to engage the Justice Departments Dreeben in a discussion about

NYT,http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/think-like-a-doctor-sweating-it-out/,The Challenge Can you solve a medical mystery involving a 25yearold man who gets sweaty and nauseated and starts vomiting uncontrollably every few weeksEvery month the Diagnosis column of The New York Times Magazine asks Well readers to sift through a difficult medical case and solve a diagnostic riddle In this case the emergency room physician gives the patient a diagnosis but the doctor caring for him doesnt think its the right one Ill give you all the information that was available when the patient first appeared in the emergency room Ill also give you the patient history and physical exam and test results obtained by the emergency room physician After that its up to you to use this information to make the correct diagnosis As usual the first person to crack the case gets a copy of my book Every Patient Tells a Story and that warm feeling you get when you figure out a tough puzzleThe Patients StoryDad I need to go to the hospital the young man croaked in a near whisper barely audible over the hum of the traffic around them Im sick again His father glanced over at his 25yearold son and knew he was in trouble The young mans face was drained of color and shiny with sweat despite the frigid winter day The father took the next exit and headed back toward Waterbury Hospital in Connecticut A Tough Way to Start the DayThe young man had woken early that morning with the familiar weight in his stomach that always preceded these terrible attacks He forced himself out of bed and did a few pushups The pressure in his stomach worsened ominously His mouth was flooded with the taste of bile a hint of what was to come If he could just manage to take his antinausea medication and crawl into a hot shower he might still be able to fight it off The hot shower had seemed to work leaving him feeling remarkably good with no nausea and none of the dread that seemed to come with it He made a cup of coffee and buttered a muffin Maybe it was going to be a good day after all His father drove him to the methadone center where he got the daily dose that kept him from relapsing into his heroin habit But standing in line waiting for the little cup of red liquid that would allow him to go to work the heaviness again settled in his stomach He gulped the cherryflavored liquid and hurried back to the car He sat quietly with his eyes closed as his father drove them toward the house where theyd both be working that day The car had barely made it to the Interstate when the young man felt the full force of nausea hit him Suddenly he was icycold inside his winter coat Sweat streamed from every pore Acid burned deep in his throat And he knew that he wasnt going to make it to work Maybe he could get to the hospital before he started vomiting because once he started there was no stopping Not for hours Another Emergency Room Visit When his father pulled into the emergency room parking lot the young man eased himself out of the car He hadnt taken more than a halfdozen steps before he fell to his knees and began vomiting By the time he made it to the ER his shirt his sweater and even the lining of his coat were drenched in sweat and covered in vomit He pulled on the hospital gown and lay down next to a large pink basin bracing himself for the next round of vomiting The nurse gave him a dose of antinausea medicine through the IV she had placed It had just started to kick in when the ER doctor came into the cubicle where the young man lay He told the doctor that he had these episodes of nausea regularly perhaps a couple of times a month Sometimes he could tough it out But far too often he ended up either here or at the hospital across town At first he blamed his heroin habit  withdrawal produced the same kind of dread he felt before the nausea hit But hed given up all those drugs heroin marijuana cocaine Hed been clean for months Hed even quit smoking Why was he still getting sickMaking a DiagnosisThe young man was no longer sweaty but still looked tired and uncomfortable His blood pressure was high and his belly was tender The doctor wasnt surprised The labs drawn earlier suggested that he had pancreatitis an inflammation of the pancreas which makes the chemicals that break down food in the small intestine Certain medications alcohol or some diseases can cause the same caustic chemicals to be released inside the pancreas itself where they start breaking down its delicate tissues as if they were food When that happens the patient will have nausea and vomiting and terrible pain in the belly just below the ribs and often radiating to the back All doctors can do then is to ease the pain and keep the patient from becoming dehydrated from all the vomiting as the injured tissues recover The doctor finished up the paperwork  the young man definitely wasnt going home You can see the emergency room triage notes here

resident on call that day hurried down to the ER after hearing about the young man with pancreatitis She was accompanied by Dam Idossa a thirdyear medical student learning the ins and outs of caring for patients in the hospital The patient was asleep when the young doctor and the student entered the room A slender tattooed arm was slung across his face A large basin at his side crowded the narrow stretcher The medical student stepped closer and called the young mans name He awakened quickly and sat up After wiping the sweat from his shiny face he told of the days onagain offagain nausea and devastating vomiting  A dozen similar episodes filled his electronic medical chart It was frustrating he told Dr Brady He used to think these attacks were caused by his excesses but he had given up alcohol years ago and then drugs as well a few months ago And the methadone program made sure he stayed clean with regular urine tests But he was still getting sick as a dog WhyAre you sure youve taken no drugs at all the doctor asked The patient replied that the only drugs he took were an antidepressant an antihistamine to help him when he had trouble sleeping and a nausea pill when he needed it And he added with a trace of reluctance there was this stuff called Spice synthetic marijuana which he bought off the shelf at a little neighborhood store He smoked that regularly But it was really just a bunch of dried weeds   legal and definitely not marijuana he told them Otherwise it would show up in the urine tests he had to take practically every week Solving the MysteryOn examination the patients blood pressure had come down and his belly was soft and without tenderness His bowel sounds were a quieter than normal but the rest of his exam was unremarkable So Dr Brady wondered what had made this young man so sick The nausea and vomiting and elevated pancreatic enzymes revealed by the blood test certainly suggested pancreatitis But the ultrasound showed a totally normal pancreas Moreover patients with pancreatitis usually have a lot of abdominal pain Its an excruciating condition And yet the patient had no tenderness at all in his belly Can you figure out what this young man has Dr Brady did Make your guesses in the comments box Ill post the answer on Friday Updated Friday March 7 328 pm  Thanks for all your responses Read about the winning diagnosis at Think Like a

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/us/politics/paul-and-wealthy-libertarians-connect-as-he-weighs-running.html,Frayda Levin a New Jersey libertarian activist and former smallbusiness owner is a woman of many passions promoting liberty ending marijuana prohibition and opposing her states recent minimumwage increase But Ms Levin has added another cause as well At gala benefits for freemarket research institutes and at fundraisers for antitax groups she has urged likeminded donors to help send Senator Rand Paul Republican of Kentucky to the White HouseI consider that one of my main goals said Ms Levin who has met with Mr Paul several times and in February introduced him at a private conference in Florida hosted by the Club for Growth a conservative advocacy group I tell people hes the Republican of the future Hes got both the intellectual heft and the emotional understandingAs he has risen in prominence as a Republican presidential contender Mr Paul is avidly courting a small but influential cluster of wealthy libertarians His pursuit offers an intriguing window into an eclectic network of potential donors who have made fortunes in Silicon Valley startups and Wall Street hedge funds a group that could form a vital donor base if he makes a bid for the Republican nomination A tightknit tribe of philanthropists and entrepreneurs they have exerted enormous intellectual influence on conservative policy But they have historically spent more on nonprofit groups and endowing college economics departments than they have on backing candidatesNow Mr Paul is seeking to nudge them into the comparatively messier world of presidential campaigningHe has recruited libertarianleaning financiers and money managers from across the country including Kenneth M Garschina founder of a 54 billion New York hedge fund and a contributor to The Review of Austrian Economics and Donald G Smith an investor and board member of the Cato Institute a libertarian research organization based in Washington Mr Pauls nascent finance team includes Joe Lonsdale a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who helped start an organization dedicated to building new sovereign cities on floating ocean platformsIn January Mr Paul was the star attraction at a fundraiser for the Goldwater Institute a libertarian foundation and legal watchdog based in Phoenix Top donors were given 10 autographed copies each of the senators book Government Bullies How Everyday Americans Are Being Harassed Abused and Imprisoned by the Feds In February at the Club for Growth meeting held at the Breakers resort in Florida Mr Paul pitched a roomful of smallgovernment true believers on the importance of reducing prison sentences for drug offensesSuch wealthy potential contributors could build on the army of small donors that helped make Mr Pauls father former Representative Ron Paul of Texas a successful fundraiser in his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns Many are also big donors to outside groups and super PACs which will be a major force in the 2016 Republican primary Others are primarily philanthropists in the nonprofit world  for nowWe think that is an avenue that is not as well tapped for pure political campaigns as it could be said Doug Stafford a political adviser to Mr PaulMr Paul is also navigating his own relationship with libertarianism a philosophy he today describes as only one of several influences on his thinking He is strongly antiabortion opposes samesex marriage but believes it should be left to the states and last summer voted against a Senate immigration overhaul bill  positions that are at odds with some schools of libertarian thinkingIm impressed with him said David Boaz executive vice president of the Cato Institute I wish he was better on the gay marriage issue and Im a little concerned with his position on immigration But I think when you combine his positions on economic issues with his views on foreign interventionism and the surveillance state you have a much better libertarian profile than I see in any other leading politicianWhile his advocacy for reduced government spending and a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget are shared by most of his Republican colleagues Mr Paul has also pushed for more unorthodox measures such as a bill to audit the Federal Reserve Last year he was among the Republican lawmakers who played down the risks of a default on the national debt  claims that angered many of the partys big donors and business alliesNevertheless since his election in 2010 Mr Paul has emerged as a force According to the Center for Responsive Politics his leadership political action committee RAND PAC has raised more money this cycle than any other Senate Republican save for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida Last fall he was the featured guest at a fundraiser in Connecticut for Senate Republicans hosted by Clifford S Asness a billionaire libertarian investor who has also financed gay rights groupsStill more than a year out from the 2016 primaries most of the biggest Republicanleaning donors are still weighing their options Mr Asness among others is said to be intrigued by Mr Paul not committed to him On Friday Mr Paul will travel to Boston to court former donors to Mitt Romney a sign that Mr Paul is also reaching out to Republican establishment giversLike other Republican contenders Mr Paul is seeking support among the 200 or so donors  many of them outsiders to the traditional Republican money establishment  who belong to Freedom Partners the donor club overseen by Charles and David H Koch perhaps the nations most influential libertarians He has spoken at the Kochs annual seminars for conservative donors and last fall Mr Paul met with David Koch in New YorkHis point is to try to show everyone how the party needs to adapt a bit and some of the things that he wants to do personally to reach out to people who have not traditionally been Republican Mr Stafford saidSome major libertarian contributors also remain on the sidelines Aside from the Kochs no libertarian donor played a bigger role in the 2012 Republican presidential primaries than Peter A Thiel the billionaire PayPal cofounder who gave 26 million to Endorse Liberty a super PAC supporting Mr Pauls father Mr Thiel described the donations as a means of promoting libertarianism suggesting that his real goal was to help build the libertarian base for 2016 Mr Lonsdale who is helping raise money for Mr Paul is a Thiel protgThrough a spokesman Mr Thiel declined to comment on his intentions for the 2016 raceFinancial industry donors to Mr Paul and his political action committee are as likely to work for smaller asset management firms in California or Florida as they are for Wall Street private equity shops or investment banksIndeed the biggest names in hedge funds and private equity are often merely socially liberal establishment Republicans not libertarians Some including the hedge fund investor Paul E Singer are also ardent foreign policy hawks especially on Israel Mr Paul has advocated a more limited United States role abroad and cuts to overseas aidHe seems to have a good understanding of domestic issues and wed all like to learn more about his opinions on foreign issues said Kenneth S Abramowitz a selfdescribed rational centrist and a founder of a New Yorkbased venture capital firm Israel is one of many issuesMr Paul has supporters among the Kochs network of donors including Ms Levin who sits on the board of Americans for Prosperity a group founded by David Koch But so do several other candidates particularly Gov Mike Pence of Indiana whose relationship with the Kochs goes back more than a decadeAdvisers and supporters of Mr Paul said his goal for the coming months was to harness libertarian supporters including those who backed his father while pitching his ideas to other donors and elected officials as a way to broaden the appeal of the Republican Party But some of his biggest fans also believe that a Paul candidacy would give some libertarian ideas more influence within Republican circlesRand Paul Ms Levin said is going to make it OK for conservatives to believe in the legalization of marijuana,2014-04-25T00:00:00Z,drugs

secondsScore well on all three of these Olympic events and theres a very good chance that you are not drunk This socalled standard field sobriety test has been shown to catch 88 percent of drivers under the influence of alcoholBut it is nowhere near as good at spotting a stoned driverIn a 2012 study published in the journal Psychopharmacology only 30 percent of people under the influence of THC the active ingredient in marijuana failed the field test And its ability to identify a stoned driver seems to depend heavily on whether the driver is accustomed to being stonedA 21yearold on his first bender and a hardened alcoholic will both wobble on one foot But the same is not necessarily true of a driver who just smoked his first joint and the stoner who is high five days a week In another study 50 percent of the less frequent smokers failed the field testAs more states legalize medical and recreational marijuana distinctions like these will grow more and more important But sciences answers to crucial questions about driving while stoned  how dangerous it is how to test for impairment and how the risks compare to driving drunk  have been slow to reach the general publicOur goal

found that 12 percent of the drivers randomly stopped on American highways on Friday and Saturday nights had been drinking In return for taking part in the study intoxicated drivers were told they would not be arrested just taken homeSix percent of the drivers tested positive for marijuana  a number that is likely to go up with increased availability Some experts and officials are concerned that the campaign against drunken driving has not gotten through to marijuana smokersWeve done phone surveys and were hearing that a lot of people think DUI laws dont apply to marijuana said Glenn Davis highway safety manager at the Department of Transportation in Colorado where recreational marijuana use became legal on Jan 1 And theres always somebody who says I drive better while highEvidence suggests that is not the case But it also suggests that we may not have as much to fear from stoned driving as from drunken driving Some researchers say that limited resources are better applied to continuing to reduce drunken driving Stoned driving they say is simply less dangerousStill it is clear that marijuana use causes deficits that affect driving ability Dr Huestis said She noted that several researchers working independently of one another have come up with the same estimate a twofold increase in the risk of an accident if there is any measurable amount of THC in the bloodstreamThe estimate is based on review papers that considered the results of many individual studies The results were often contradictory  some of the papers showed no increase in risk or even a decrease  but the twofold estimate is widely acceptedThe estimate is low however compared with the dangers of drunken driving A recent study of federal crash data found that 20yearold drivers with a bloodalcohol content of 008 percent  the legal limit for driving  had an almost 20fold increase in the risk of a fatal accident compared with sober drivers For older adults up to age 34 the increase was ninefoldThe studys lead author Eduardo Romano a senior research scientist at the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation said that once he adjusted for demographics and the presence of alcohol marijuana did not statistically increase the risk of a crashDespite our results I still think that marijuana contributes to crash risk he said only that its contribution is not as important as it was expectedThe difference in risk between marijuana and alcohol can probably be explained by two things Dr Huestis and Dr Romano both say First stoned drivers drive differently from drunken ones and they have different deficits Drunken drivers tend to drive faster than normal and to overestimate their skills studies have shown the opposite is true for stoned driversThe joke with that is Cheech and Chong being arrested for doing 20 on the freeway said Mark A R Kleiman a professor of public policy at the UCLA School of Public AffairsDr Huestis also found that in laboratory studies most people who were high could pass simple tests of memory addition and subtraction though they had to use more brainpower than sober people who passed the same tests People who were drunk were much more likely to failThe deficits of being stoned really began to show up she said when people had to handle multiple tasks at once and were confronted with something unexpectedIts typical to see a young adolescent with three or four other kids in the car she said of stoned driving Hes aware he might be impaired so hes driving carefullyBut then he sees an old man in the middle of the street All his senses say This guy is there but will be out of way by the time I get there But then the old man drops his keys and hes slower than the kid expected By the time it takes to process a change in the situation theres an accidentAnother factor is location A lot of drinking is done in bars and clubs away from home with patrons driving to get there and then leaving by car By contrast marijuana smokers tend to get high at homeThere is a lot of debate about how best to prove that drivers under the influence of THC are too intoxicated to drive Bloodalcohol content can be reliably tested on the side of the road with a Breathalyzer and ample data link rising levels of blood alcohol to decreases in driving skills The same is not true for marijuanaTHC levels must be measured from blood or urine samples which are typically taken hours after an arrest Urine tests which look for a metabolite of THC rather than the drug itself return a positive result days or weeks after someone has actually smoked Yet most states have laws that equate any detectable level of THC metabolite in urine with detectable levels of actual THC in blood and criminalize both Only six states have set legal limits for THC concentration in the blood In Colorado and Washington where recreational use has been legalized that limit is five nanograms per milliliter of blood or five parts per billionThe problem Dr Huestis said was that studies from Europe suggested that this limit was far too high Ninety percent of impaireddriving cases in Sweden would be missed at that level she saidThe studies indicated that a better limit would be just one nanogram per milliliter she said But because THC builds up in fatty tissue and is released slowly over time such a limit would ensnare frequent users who may not actually be high Indeed if you smoke often enough your bloodTHC content might still be five nanograms per milliliter a day after you last lit upAll of these facts lead experts like Dr Romano and Dr Kleiman to believe that public resources are better spent combating drunken driving Stoned driving they say is best dealt with by discouraging people from mixing marijuana and alcohol  a combination that is even riskier than alcohol alone  and by policies that minimize marijuanas risk on the roadFor instance states that legalize recreational marijuana Dr Kleiman said should ban establishments like pot bars that encourage people to smoke away from home And Dr Romano said that lowering the legal bloodalcohol concentration or BAC to 005 or even 002 percent would reduce risk far more effectively than any effort to curb stoned drivingIm not saying marijuana is safe he said But to me its clear that lowering the BAC should be our top priority That policy would save more

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/03/05/us/ap-us-legalizing-marijuana-washington.html,OLYMPIA Wash   Washington state issued its first legalmarijuana business license Wednesday launching a new phase in the states ambitious effort to regulate a market that has been illegal for more than 75 yearsSean Green who has operated medical marijuana dispensaries in Spokane and the Seattle suburb of Shoreline proclaimed the document beautiful as it was handed to him at a state Liquor Control Board meeting in OlympiaThe license will allow him to grow 21000 square feet of cannabis at his Spokane facility  the first pot that will be grown for sale under the highly taxed system approved by voters in 2012 The possession of marijuana became legal for adults over 21 soon after the vote but its still illegal to grow or sell it for recreational use until pot shops open in the state later this yearGreen plans to start by raising marijuana starter plants to sell to other growers and later expand to growing buds for retail pot shopsCannabis prohibition is over Green declared to applause from a room packed with his supporters Im coming home with jobs SpokaneSales began Jan 1 in Colorado the only other state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana But Colorado already had a regulated medical marijuana system and simply began by allowing medical dispensaries to sell recreational pot Washington had no regulated medical systemThe Liquor Control Board said Green got the first license because he was the first applicant to complete the processThe board also received more than 2200 retail applications and is expected to hold lotteries in at least some areas before allowing 334 pot shops statewide Washingtons first pot stores are expected to open in June or JulySeattle attorney Alison Holcomb who led the states legalization campaign called it excitingIts easy to talk about what marijuana legalization might look like she said Its a much different thing to see it roll outGreen is chief executive of Spokanes Kouchlock Productions a company named for the phenomenon of being too stoned to get off the couch The boards three members credited the hard work he did to meet the requirements to obtain a license including passing criminal and financial background checks developing a boardapproved business plan and finding a location that wasnt too close to schools or daycaresWere proud of you board chairwoman Sharon Foster said We now know there are folks out there who follow the rules and are willing to be participants of this brave new venture in Washington stateBut even the issuance of the first license underscored the hurdles the industry continues to face Pot remains illegal under federal law and despite recent guidance from the US Treasury and Justice departments banks continue to be wary of working with marijuana businessesGreen said he has lost bank accounts six times because of his connection to the pot industry most recently last week He already found another one but isnt sure how long hell be able to keep itGreen said he got involved in the industry after his decadelong career as an independent realestate appraiser dried up He took 10000 and started Pacific Northwest Medical in Shoreline in 2011 later expanding to SpokaneHe plans to begin by growing 1200 square feet of starter plants to provide to other growers as they become licensed He said he plans expand to growing marijuana buds for retail with 30 to 50 employees For now he plans to also continue running his medical operations though the Legislature is considering whether to bring medical marijuana into the same system as recreational potGreen also said he plans to make cannabisinfused candies as well as what he described as a super joint an ultrastrong marijuana cigarette made with cannabis oil and flowersDerek Franklin president of the Washington Association for Substance Abuse and Violence Prevention said he found it troubling that Green was getting the first license with the message sent by the Kouchlock name as well as the idea of the super jointThere doesnt seem to be much attention being paid to public health and public safety he saidThough the board praised Green for following the rules some questions remained about his medical marijuana business As first discovered by The Seattle Times two of Pacific Northwest Medicals former employees filed complaints with the state Department of Labor and Industries alleging it had withheld their wages The wages totaling more than 1600 were later paid records showOne of the complainants also alleged Green had sexually harassed another employeeDepartment spokesman Matthew Erlich confirmed Labor and Industries received the two complaints He said the agency would have referred the complainant who alleged sexual harassment to the state Human Rights CommissionThe commission said it never received any sexual harassment complaint concerning Green or his companyGreen said twice at a news conference he was unaware of the complaints But Erlich later contradicted that saying in an email to The Associated Press that the department dealt directly with Green to get the complaints resolvedThe liquor boards director said staff would not have considered the civil complaints in deciding whether to give Green a license___,2014-03-05T13:35:11Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/us/us-issues-marijuana-guidelines-for-banks.html,The Obama administration on Friday issued guidelines intended to give banks confidence that they will not be punished if they provide services to legitimate marijuana businesses in states that have legalized the medical or recreational use of the drug even though it remains illicit under federal lawThe guidance which requires banks to vigorously monitor their marijuanaindustry customers was provided by the Treasury Department and the Justice Department in separate advisories The policy does not grant immunity from prosecution or civil penalties to banks that serve legal marijuana businesses But it directs prosecutors and regulators to give priority to cases only where financial institutions have failed to adhere to the guidanceStill the banking industry was quick to say that the new guidelines would not be sufficient to make banks feel at ease about opening accounts for or granting loans to marijuana businesses because the drug would still be illegal under the federal Controlled Substances ActWhile we appreciate the efforts by the Department of Justice and FinCEN guidance or regulation doesnt alter the underlying challenge for banks Frank Keating president of the American Bankers Association said in a statement referring to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network the Treasury unit that issued part of the guidelines As it stands possession or distribution of marijuana violates federal law and banks that provide support for those activities face the risk of prosecution and assorted sanctionsTwenty states and the District of Columbia allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes and two of those states Colorado and Washington have also legalized the recreational use of the drug Those numbers may grow this year as several other states are considering measures to legalize marijuana useIn a threepage memo to prosecutors issued in conjunction with the new banking guidelines Deputy Attorney General James M Cole wrote that prosecutions may not be appropriate when banks do business with marijuana entities that are operating legally under state law and do not violate any of the eight priorities set forth in a Justice Department memo last August Those priorities include preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors and preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprisesJennifer Shasky Calvery director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network said she was unaware of any banks that have been punished for servicing legal marijuana businessesLegal marijuana entrepreneurs have stressed that access to banking has been their most pressing concern Their businesses are conducted almost entirely in cash raising huge security concerns because it is difficult for them to open and maintain bank accounts or to accept credit cards Banks have been apprehensive about providing services to marijuana businesses for fear that the authorities might punish them for violating moneylaundering laws among other federal statutes and regulationsLast month Attorney General Eric H Holder Jr acknowledged that having so much cash on hand presented a public safety problem for legal marijuana businesses adding that they should have access to the countrys banking systemSome representatives of the legal marijuana industry said that although the guidelines showed progress federal laws need to be revampedIts a great step in the right direction but ultimately it would not solve all the problems here said Michael Elliott executive director of the Medical Marijuana Industry Group in Colorado We need to go beyond saying that this is a low law enforcement priority There are still violations of federal law going on here So federal laws need to be changed to ensure that what is legal in states like Colorado is legal at the federal level as wellMarijuana remains a Schedule 1 drug  along with heroin LSD and Ecstasy  under the Controlled Substances Act This week 18 members of Congress in a joint letter to President Obama asked him to instruct Mr Holder to remove marijuana from any of the drug schedules or to reschedule it to a lower categoryClassifying marijuana as Schedule 1 at the federal level perpetuates an unjust and irrational system the lawmakers led by Representative Earl Blumenauer Democrat of Oregon said in the letter Schedule 1 recognizes no medical use disregarding both medical evidence and the laws of nearly half of the states that have legalized medical marijuanaMs Shasky Calvery said in a conference call with reporters that the guidelines should clarify how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana businesses while maintaining their obligation to comply with the federal antimoneylaundering law the Bank Secrecy Act She also said that the guidelines were drafted to move from the shadows the financial operations of marijuana businessesThe guidance will provide transparency and mitigate the risks to the financial system Ms Shasky Calvery said The authorities do not intend to crack down on banks for a technical mishap she said adding We are not looking to have a gotcha enforcement regimeIn a sevenpage document explaining the guidelines FinCEN called for due diligence by financial institutions in monitoring their marijuana customers including reviewing their applications for state licenses and understanding their normal and expected activity such as the types of products they sell and whether they have medical or recreational customersSince the financial transactions of a marijuana business are considered illegal under federal law banks are required to file suspicious activity reports on those entities A spokesman for the Treasury unit Steve Hudak said the reports under the guidelines would be abbreviated versions Banks will have to initially file one suspicious activity report on a marijuana business then three a year after thatThe new guidelines also establish different kinds of suspicious activity reports depending on whether a bank believes a marijuana business is running afoul of the Justice Departments priorities or is violating state law,2014-02-15T00:00:00Z,drugs

uncooperative with the process airport police Sgt Karla Ortiz said She said he told a TSA agent that he had a bomb before walking to the gate When airport police officers caught up with him Ortiz said Smith became uncooperative and was taken into custodyA witness video posted on TMZcom shows Smith exchanging words with an officer as he was being handcuffed and escorted out of the gate areaSmith was booked for investigation of making a false bomb threat FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said anyone who makes a bomb threat at an airport is potentially subject to federal charges although no such

further commentA fearsome passrushing specialist Smith took a fivegame leave of absence from the 49ers last season to undergo treatment for substance abuse He rejoined the team Nov 5Smith played in a 277 home loss to the Indianapolis Colts on Sept 22 two days after he was arrested and jailed on suspicion of DUI and marijuana possession After the game he publicly apologized for his behavior and later announced he would leave for treatmentLeading up to the playoffs in early January Smith said during an interview with The Associated Press he was encouraged by the strides he had made to better himself off the football field that put life  and his work  in perspective  He said at the time he hadnt had any alcohol since before his Sept 20 DUI arrest and that he wasnt craving it When he rejoined the team Nov 5 he insisted he was on the path to lifelong sobriety stuck by that statementHis teammates rallied around him in support of his rehab and later his return to the teamSmith emerged as one of the NFLs mostfeared pass rushers in 2012 He had a franchiserecord 195 sacks that year but failed to record a sack in his final six games including the teams postseason Super Bowl runSmith finished with 8 sacks and 34 tackles in 11 games last season making eight startsIn November Smith pleaded not guilty to three felony counts of illegal possession of an assault weapon stemming from a June 2012 party at his home Investigators say several shots were fired two partygoers were injured and Smith was stabbed In the subsequent investigation prosecutors say detectives found five unregistered weapons in Smiths house including two Bushmaster rifles and an Armalite AR10T They say those are assault weapons illegal to possess under California lawSmith and former teammate Delanie Walker were named in a lawsuit last September filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court by a Northern California man who said he was shot at a party at Smiths house on June 29 2012  The players

the NFC championship gameThis is the latest in a long list of legal issues for 49ers players the past two years  and recently too The Niners who lost to the rival and eventual champion Seattle Seahawks in the NFC championship game have made nearly as much news away from the field as they have in free agency this offseasonOn Thursday 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was one of three NFL players named in a Miami police report involving a woman who passed out in a hotel and later woke up in a hospital not knowing how she got there though no one has been charged with a crime Kaepernick 49ers wide receiver Quinton Patton and Seahawks wide receiver Ricardo Lockette  a former 49er  were with the woman at a Miami hotel where Lockette lives according to the Miami Police Department report

derail the rollout of a nascent recreational pot industry across a quarter of Washington state where it still holds some traditional rightsThe roughly 10000member Yakama Nation had already asserted sovereignty to keep pot outlawed on 12 million acres of reservation land it controls in central Washingtons Yakima ValleyBut in a bold move that could test the limits of tribal sovereignty the Yakama are also seeking to bar pot cultivation and sales from a 108 million acre stretch of the state it ceded under an 1855 treaty with the US government but where the tribe still holds hunting foodgathering and fishing rightsMarijuana is the biggest problem for our people up to age 40 said George Colby attorney for the Yakama Nation Its a bigger problem than alcoholThe move adds to a growing backlash against pot in Washington state that pits the liberal tech hub of Seattle against some more conservative areas At least six local governments are also taking a stand to keep out pot businesses including two that lie on the Yakamas ceded landsMarijuana businesses on those lands spanning 10 counties would exacerbate an epidemic of use in a tribe with no cultural ties to pot Yakama says It has filed challenges to nearly 1300 pending pot business applications thereThe tribe which has threatened to sue if its demands are not met in the past has won legal cases blocking projects deemed detrimental to its wellbeing including a proposed landfill on the ceded lands About a quarter of the land is national forest where pot is already banned by federal lawChris Marr a member of the state Liquor Control Board charged with regulating pot said it would consider the tribes concerns when issuing individual licenses but views the tribes assertion of authority with skepticismAs far as requiring us to deny applications on all ceded lands to me that seems to be quite a heavy lift he saidWashington and Colorado became the first US states to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012 ballot initiatives and a similar measure will be on the ballot in Alaska this summerThe federal government classifies marijuana as an illegal narcotic although the Obama administration issued guidelines in August giving states new leeway to experiment with legalized cannabis Colorado was the first to open a network of statelicensed marijuana stores in JanuaryWashington which issued its first potgrowing license this month is set to follow suit in June Pot regulators have received more than 7000 applications from entrepreneurs seeking licenses to grow process or sell marijuanaCONFRONTATION OR COMPROMISEThe Yakama Nation has cited federal antidrug laws and its desire to curb pot use among its young tribal members in challenging marijuana retail business applications in the ceded lands where over 600000 nonIndians resideA 2011 US National Survey on Drug Use and Health report found 22 percent of Native American youth ages 15 to 17 had used marijuana within the past month nearly double the national averageIf no accommodation is reached the tribe will likely make an unprecedented assertion of tribal authority over the ceded lands by suing in federal court Colby said While it has fought off uses of ceded land it deems objectionable before it has never sought to block a state law from taking hold thereWe are making this the test case Colby saidTroy Eid a former US Attorney for Colorado who chairs a federal advisory panel for criminal justice issues on Native American lands suggested the sides try to reach a settlement rather than heading into a drawnout court caseThey ought to come to some voluntary agreement where each side reserves its arguments about sovereignty and its ability to make law Eid saidThe Yakama Nations demands put it somewhat awkwardly on the same side of the fence as the cities of Yakima and Wenatchee which have enacted their own bans on marijuana retailers and producers over the objections of state regulatorsAlong with other local governments preferring to keep marijuana sales out Yakima and Wenatchee got a boost when the state attorney general issued an opinion in January that cities and counties could opt to ban pot within their own boundariesBut both Yakima and Wenatchee overlap the tribes ceded lands and were wary of appearing to acknowledge any assertions of Indian sovereignty thereWhen they start talking about ceded land theres a lot of other things involved other than marijuana like water rights said Yakima city councilman Bill Lover who opposes pot businessesLeaders of other Native American tribes by contrast have expressed support for the Yakamas bold demands even if no other tribes appear poised to followed suitIts a steep hill theyre trying to climb said Ron Allen chairman of the Jamestown SKlallam Tribe in western Washington which is among a majority of US tribes on whose reservations pot use remains banned But I recognize their right to try to control the environment their community lives withinEditing by Cynthia Johnston and Gunna Dickson,2014-03-24T12:17:47Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/18/nyregion/clinton-backer-pleads-guilty-in-a-straw-donor-scheme.html,As Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ran for president in 2008 one of her most enthusiastic financial supporters was Sant Singh Chatwal an IndianAmerican hotel and restaurant owner whose relationship with the Clintons dated back yearsMr Chatwal was a regular at Clinton campaign events in New York a genial and gregarious presence in his red turban He had directed more than 200000 through his businesses to her 2000 Senate campaign when unregulated softmoney donations were still permissibleBoth Bill and Hillary Clinton along with Senator Charles E Schumer and Representative Richard A Gephardt were guests at the wedding of one of Mr Chatwals sons Vivek at Tavern on the Green in New York City in 2002For Mrs Clintons presidential run in 2008 Mr Chatwal went on to raise at least 100000 It now turns out however that much of what Mr Chatwal raised was tainted a product of an elaborate straw donor scheme in which Mr Chatwal illegally reimbursed donors for their contributionsMr Chatwal pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in Brooklyn on Thursday to skirting federal campaign contribution laws and witness tampering admitting that he had funneled more than 180000 in illegal contributions between 2007 and 2011 to three federal candidates  identified by a person with knowledge of the investigation as Mrs Clinton Senator Christopher J Dodd of Connecticut and Representative Kendrick B Meek of FloridaMr Chatwal owns the Chatwal and the Dream hotels and the Bombay Palace restaurant chain He has long been shadowed by financial and legal problems in both the United States and India filing for bankruptcy twice facing allegations of bank fraud and owing millions in back taxesNow Mr Chatwal 70 faces up to 25 years in prison It is not hard to discern Mr Chatwals motivation for his scheme according to information filed by federal prosecutors He described the importance of the donations to a government informant in a recorded conversationWithout that nobody will even talk to you When they are in need of money he said the money you give then they are always for you Thats the only way to buy themThe Chatwal family has had a colorful history Mr Chatwals other son Vikram is a nightlife fixture whose corporate website describes him as a manabouttown who has friendships with some of Hollywoods most influential stars has dated the models Gisele Bndchen and Esther Caadas and is a friend of the rapper Sean Combs and the actress Lindsay Lohan He was arrested last April after trying to board a flight while carrying cocaine marijuana and prescription pills and has had several stints in rehabilitationThe elder Chatwals realm was politics He had a private dinner with Ms Clinton when she was visiting India and was a regular at state dinners at the White House under three different presidents  Mr Clinton George W Bush and Barack ObamaHe and his family have given more than 350000 to candidates for federal office since the 1990s and have raised hundreds of thousands moreHis business problems raised some alarms but never enough to lock him out of the process One former fundraiser for Mrs Clinton recalled Mr Chatwal as always nice but desperate to be seen as close to powerAnother Clinton fundraiser described Mr Chatwal as a regular at Clinton Global Initiative and campaign events often proffering invitations to his Lambs Club restaurant or his hotelsHe filed for bankruptcy protection in 1995 and in 1997 was sued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for his role in a failed New York bank A naturalized United States citizen he was charged in 2000 with bank fraud in India but was eventually dropped from the caseIn April 2007 Mr Chatwal formed Indian Americans for Hillary 2008 and pledged to raise 5 million for her presidential campaignOne of the straw donor schemes that prosecutors sketched out in court records started that year Mr Chatwal asked an associate who owed him 25 million to help him raise money for a candidate prosecutors said The court records say that the associate distributed 90000 and kept a minimal sum as a commission and that Mr Chatwal reduced the total the associate owed him by 100000 The resulting contributions by straw donors appeared to support at least three fundraising events for that candidate according to the court recordsMr Chatwal could be frank about the power of money in politics In the fall of 2010 according to court documents Mr Chatwal and a business owner who is now cooperating with prosecutors decided that they should raise money using straw donors for another candidate so the candidate might intervene with a federal regulatory agency that had issued an adverse ruling regarding the other persons business Thats the only way to buy them get into the system Mr Chatwal was recorded as saying to the person who by then was cooperating with prosecutorsTo reimburse straw donors for contributions made to a third candidate Mr Chatwal instructed a contractor involved in the scheme to pad an invoice for work done for one of his businesses by 69000 to cover some of the contributions according to prosecutorsIn September 2010 around the time of actions described by prosecutors Mr Clinton was then helping Mr Meek in a threeway race  against Charlie Crist an independent and Marco Rubio the Republican who ultimately won  for a Senate seat from Florida that was seen as very important to the Democratic Party and the Obama White HouseThat month Mr Chatwal hosted a fundraiser for Mr Meek at his Lambs Club restaurant in Manhattan which had just opened in the Chatwal Hotel on West 44th St Mr Clinton stopped by to say a few words on Mr Meeks behalf according to news reports at the timeBy 2012 both the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were looking into Mr Chatwals activities He was recorded multiple times telling an associate to lie about the donations according to court recordsHe appeared in court on Thursday wearing his usual red turban a pink shirt and a red tie He said little more than Yes sir as Judge I Leo Glasser accepted his guilty pleas He was released on 750000 bail forfeited his passport and agreed to forfeit 1 million to the government His sentencing is scheduled for July 31He remains chairman of Hampshire Hotels and Resorts his hotel and management group but this month stepped down as chief executiveMr Chatwal deeply regrets his actions and accepts full responsibility for the consequences a spokeswoman for Mr Chatwal Lesley Bogdanow said He looks forward to resolving this personal matter,2014-04-18T00:00:00Z,drugs

the Philippines and taking bribes from undercover FBI agents including one who posed as a marijuana dealer Another was accused of taking bribes from federal agents impersonating Hollywood film executives And a third was convicted of perjury and voter fraud after lying about where he lived when he ran for officeAll three are Democratic state senators from California and their recent legal problems have brought rare bad news to a party that has come to thoroughly dominate politics in this state but now looks besieged by highprofile corruption casesThe State Senate voted last Friday to suspend all three men after the arms trafficking and bribery charges against Senator Leland Yee of San Francisco were made public Party leaders however citing due process have refused to cast them out even as Gov Jerry Brown also a Democrat called on the men to resignIn one sign that the party is aware of the scandals potential political fallout Darrell Steinberg the Senates president pro tem and majority leader canceled a planned fundraiser scheduled for this weekend amid concerns about the appearance of Democrats being seen playing golf with lobbyistsThough there is little chance that Democrats will lose control of the Legislature in November the suspensions provide ammunition to beleaguered Republicans eyeing close elections in swing districts The recent string of corruption cases has led Democrats to struggle with how best to discipline the men and keep Republicans from using the scandals to gain political tractionOne is an anomaly two is a coincidence but three Mr Steinberg said hinting at the broader meaning of the suspensions before last Fridays voteRepublicans said the scandal could provide an opportunity for them When three members from the same party suffer its possible people look at things through a different metric said Bob Huff a Republican and the Senate minority leader It might disenfranchise a lot of voters who feel that we are all corrupt But that may make a difference in a few of our tight seats absolutelyMr Yee was arrested last week after becoming ensnared in a wideranging federal corruption investigation that initially focused on organized crime figures in San Franciscos Chinatown According to the FBIs 137page affidavit Mr Yee desperate to retire 70000 in campaign debt from a failed run for mayor of San Francisco in 2011 accepted tens of thousands of dollars in bribes from undercover agents posing as businessmen seeking to influence marijuana legislation or buy large quantities of firearmsAfter his arrest Mr Yee dropped out of the race for California secretary of state his lawyer said that he would plead not guiltyHis troubles followed those of two Democrats from the Los Angeles area Ron Calderon whose district includes parts of Los Angeles and East LA was indicted in February on charges that he accepted 100000 in bribes and gifts in exchange for pushing legislation that would benefit various groups He is also accused of directing an undercover FBI agent posing as a film industry executive to donate tens of thousands of dollars to a private organization controlled by his brother Thomas Calderon a former Democratic state assemblyman The lawmaker has pleaded not guiltyIn January Rod Wright was convicted on eight felony counts of perjury and voter fraud A Los Angeles jury found him guilty of lying about the location of his home when he ran for office in 2008 California law requires candidates to live in the district they represent He is scheduled to be sentenced in May but is expected to appealThe Democraticcontrolled Senate at first dealt leniently with Mr Wright and Mr Calderon allowing them to take paid leaves of absence from the Legislature Their departure cost the Democrats their twothirds supermajority in the chamberBut last Friday two days after Mr Yees arrest the Senate voted to suspend all three men  the first time any member has been suspended in the chambers history The suspensions bar them from engaging in legislative affairs but allow them to receive their salariesCritics described the suspensions as slaps on the wrist meant to minimize the scandals political fallout and called instead for expulsion For Democrats looking at the forthcoming primaries and general elections the expulsion process would draw unnecessary attention especially to Mr Calderon and Mr Yee who must give up their seats at the end of the year anyway because of term limitsWe are expecting low voter turnout in the primaries and general elections which means that you have an electorate that is smaller and more tuned in to the news and issues surfacing in state politics and so it may end up having an impact on races at the local level said Mark Baldassare president of the Public Policy Institute of CaliforniaJoel Anderson a Republican state senator from San Diego voted against the suspensions because he favors expulsion The suspensions he said amounted to paid holidaysI believe the Democrats are out of touch with the citizens he said Until they have an open and honest debate on whether the senators should be expelled I think theres going to be a dark cloud over the Democrat PartySteve Boilard executive director of the Center for California Studies at California State University Sacramento said the scandals may accelerate a trend in which losses for

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/us/cannabis-legal-localities-begin-to-just-say-no.html,YAKIMA Wash   The momentum toward legalized marijuana might seem like an inevitable tide with states from Florida to New York considering easing laws for medical use and a fullblown recreational industry rapidly emerging in Colorado and here in Washington StateBut across the country resistance to legal marijuana is also rising with an increasing number of towns and counties moving to ban legal sales The efforts still largely local have been fueled by the opening or imminent opening of retail marijuana stores here and in Colorado as well as by recent legal opinions that have supported such bans in some statesAt stake are hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenues from marijuana sales  promised by legalizations supporters and now eagerly anticipated by state governments  that could be sharply reduced if local efforts to ban such sales expandBut the fight also signals a larger battle over the future of legal marijuana whether it will be a national industry providing nearuniversal access or a patchwork system with isolated islands of mainly urban sales To some partisans the debate has echoes to the postProhibition era when dry towns emerged in some states in response to legalized alcohol At some point we have to put some boundaries said Rosetta Horne a nondenominational Christian church minister here in Yakima at a public hearing on Tuesday night where she urged the City Council to enact a permanent ban on marijuana businessesThough it seems strongest in more rural and conservative communities the resistance has been surprisingly bipartisan In states from Louisiana to Indiana that are discussing decriminalizing marijuana Republican opponents of relaxing the drug laws are finding themselves loosely allied with Democratic skeptics Voices in the Obama administration concerned about growing access have joined antidrug crusaders like Patrick J Kennedy a Democratic formerUnited Statesrepresentative from Rhode Island who contends that the potential health risks of marijuana have not been adequately explored especially for juveniles  and who has written and spoken widely about his own struggles with alcohol and prescription drugsIn some ways I think the best thing that could have happened to the antilegalization movement was legalization because I think it shows people the ugly side said Kevin A Sabet a former drug policy adviser to President Obama and the executive director and cofounder with Mr Kennedy of Smart Approaches to Marijuana The group founded last year supports removing criminal penalties for using marijuana but opposes full legalization and is working with local organizations around the nation to challenge legalizationIf legalization advocates just took a little bit more time and were not so obsessed with doing this at a thousand miles per hour he added it might be better Instead they are helping precipitate a backlashIn Washington the Yakima County Commission has already said that it plans to ban marijuana businesses in the unincorporated areas outside Yakima city Clark County Washington is considering a ban on recreational sales that would affect the huge marijuana market in Portland Ore just across the Columbia River And the states second most populous county Pierce just south of Seattle said last month it would bar recreational businesses from openingPockets of retrenchment have emerged in other states as well In California one of 20 states and the District of Columbia that allow marijuana use for medical purposes a state appeals court said late last year that local governments could prohibit the growing of medical marijuana Fresno County promptly did so becoming the first county in the state medical marijuana advocates said to ban all marijuana cultivationLawmakers in Oregon are considering a bill that would allow municipalities to restrict or prohibit medical marijuana Colorados recreational marijuana law opened for business Jan 1 with retail sales but dozens of local governments including Colorado Springs the states secondlargest city have prohibited marijuana commerceNational politicians from Mr Obama on down appear just as conflicted Mr Obama said last week that he believed the experiment in Washington State and Colorado should be allowed and Attorney General Eric H Holder Jr said Thursday that the Justice and Treasury Departments were developing guidelines to make it easier for legal marijuana businesses to obtain banking services currently prohibited under federal law But at the same time a senior federal Drug Enforcement Agency official recently expressed alarm that marijuana use and access are spreading so rapidlyHere in Yakima an agricultural city of wine and apples population 93000 each side in Tuesdays often emotional twohour Council meeting talked about risk Proponents of the ban said they feared that neighborhoods and cherished patterns of life would be harmed by recreational marijuana businesses Opponents including some marijuana business license applicants warned of economic harm and legal liability if the ban passedBy the evenings end the vote was not close  6 to 1 for a complete prohibition of marijuana businessesYakimas course council members said was bolstered by the states attorney general Bob Ferguson who this month issued a nonbinding legal opinion that local governments could ban recreational marijuana under I502 the initiative legalizing recreational marijuana that Washington voters approved in 2012 Critics said Mr Fergusons reasoning flew against the intent of the law which says that marijuana must be available to all state residentsBut even before his opinion resistance was growing Across Washington local moratoriums or bans covering more than 15 million people  about one in five residents  were in place by midJanuary according to a prolegalization research group in Seattle the Center for the Study of Cannabis and Social PolicyOn a broader level some legal experts say the emerging opposition to legal marijuana could lead to legal challenges that strike at the heart of the legalization laws in Colorado and Washington  or affirm themExperts expect legal challenges to local bans from wouldbe marijuana business operators In anticipation of such litigation some communities are already claiming that they have the legal right to ban legal sellers and growers because the drug remains illegal under federal lawFederal law trumps this said Bill Lover a Yakima City Council member who voted for the banWe dont think they win said Alison Holcomb the criminal justice director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington and leader of 2012s ballot initiative She added that legal precedents for states ignoring federal law went back at least to the end of Prohibition when many states simply refused to enforce federal laws forbidding the sale of alcohol This is essentially how alcohol prohibition was repealed she saidA deeper engine driving opposition to legal marijuana is anxiety about the ways that the rapid expansion of marijuana shops and increasingly easy access to the drug might change communities None of the new local bans affect possession of marijuana for personal use which is legal statewide in WashingtonThis is not about the adult being able to smoke a joint said Mr Sabet of Smart Approaches to Marijuana Its about widespread access its about changing the landscape of a neighborhood its about widespread promotion and advertising and its about youth accessSupporters of legalization say that because voters statewide approved a system guaranteeing adults access to legal marijuana they will push state regulators and lawmakers to meet that mandate possibly by pushing for penalties against local governments that enact bansBut Dave Ettl a Yakima City Council member who voted for the ban said he was willing to risk penalties saying he considered the promised tax revenues from marijuana sales taintedTheres some money thats not worth getting he said,2014-01-27T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/03/14/us/ap-us-legalizing-marijuana-background-checks.html,SEATTLE   The FBI is refusing to run nationwide background checks on people applying to run legal marijuana businesses in Washington state even though it has conducted similar checks in Colorado  a discrepancy that illustrates the quandary the Justice Department faces as it allows the states to experiment with regulating a drug thats long been illegal under federal lawWashington state has been asking for nearly a year if the FBI would conduct background checks on its applicants to no avail The bureaus refusal raises the possibility that people with troublesome criminal histories could wind up with pot licenses in the state  undermining the departments own priorities in ensuring that states keep a tight rein on the nascent industryIts a strange jam for the feds who announced last summer that they wouldnt sue to prevent Washington and Colorado from regulating marijuana after 75 years of prohibitionThe Obama administration has said it wants the states to make sure pot revenue doesnt go to organized crime and that state marijuana industries dont become a cover for the trafficking of other illegal drugs At the same time it might be tough for the FBI to stomach conducting such background checks  essentially helping the states violate federal lawThe Justice Department declined to explain why it isnt conducting the checks in Washington when it has in Colorado Stephen Fischer a spokesman for the FBIs Criminal Justice Information Services Division referred an Associated Press inquiry to DOJ headquarters which would only issue a written statementTo ensure a consistent national approach the department has been reviewing its background check policies and we hope to have guidance for states in the near term it said in its entiretyIn Washington three people so far have received licenses to grow marijuana  without going through a national background check even though the state Liquor Control Boards rules require that that they do so before a license is issuedThe federal government has not stated why it has not yet agreed to conduct national background checks on our behalf Washington state Liquor Control Board spokesman Brian Smith said in an email However the Liquor Control Board is ready to deliver fingerprints as soon as DOJ is readyIn the meantime officials are relying on background checks by the Washington State Patrol to catch any instate arrests or convictions Applicants must have lived in Washington state for three months before applying and many are longtime Washington residents whose criminal history would likely turn up on a State Patrol check But others specifically moved to the state in hopes of joining the new industryBoth Washington state and Washington DC have been unequivocal that they want organized crime out of the marijuana business said Alison Holcomb the Seattle lawyer who authored the legal pot law Requiring and ensuring nationwide background checks on Washington state licensees is a nobrainerThe FBI has run nationwide background checks since 2010 on applicants who sought to be involved in medical marijuana dispensaries in Colorado Daria Serna a spokeswoman for that states Department of Revenue said in an email The applicants provide fingerprints to Revenues Marijuana Enforcement Division which turns them over to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation The agency conducts a statewide background check and supplies the prints to the FBI for a national checkBecause Colorado launched its marijuana industry by converting medical dispensaries to recreational pot shops its likely that no additional background checks were required for the key employees of those shops Serna said However all new employees of recreational or medical shops must undergo the same background checks  and those are still being processed Serna saidDoing background checks and making sure the criminal element has been locked out of the program has been enormously important in Colorado said Michael Elliott director of the Medical Marijuana Industry Group The integrity of Washingtons program may be put into jeopardy because the FBI is not willing to ensure that drug cartels and criminals are being locked out and that is absurdIn Washington officials use a point system to determine whether someones criminal history is too troubling to grant them a license to grow process or sell marijuana under the states law passed by voters in 2012 A felony within the past 10 years normally disqualifies an applicant as does being under federal or state supervision for a felony convictionThe state received more than 7000 applications during a monthlong window that began in November Applicants are required to supply fingerprints and disclose their criminal history with omissions punishable by license forfeiture or denial But without a federal background check theres no way for state officials to verify what the applicants reportUnder rules adopted by the Liquor Control Board the applicants fingerprints must be submitted to the State Patrol and the FBI for checks as a condition of receiving a license Asked whether issuing licenses without the FBI check contradicted that rule Smith wrote Applicants have provided the prints necessary for running the checkDeborah Collinsworth manager of the Washington State Patrols Identification and Criminal History Section said she first asked the FBI in April 2013 about conducting national background checks on potbusiness applicantsThey havent responded because marijuana is still federally illegal Collinsworth said Thats the rub___AP writers Kristen Wyatt and Sadie Gurman contributed from

them in childresistant packages and bars labels designed to appeal to children It requires manufacturers to list ingredients serving sizes and expiration datesBut critics say the regulations are not strict enough especially for products that can contain 10 times as much psychoactive THC as the marijuana a casual user might take Because prices often depend on the amount of THC one highly potent

was drowsy and drooping and struggling to walk When she took her to the hospital the girl tested positive for THC according to a police reportShes fine now Ms Hernandez said in a brief interview while Evelyn grinning waved and made faces from the livingroom couchOn the other side of the state in a farm town renowned for its sweet corn a student from Olathe High School ended up in the emergency room after a 14yearold classmate passed some marijuanainfused brownies around the school last week Justin Harlan the Olathe police chief said the brownies appeared to have been homemade not sold from a dispensary He said his officers were still investigating how the student had gotten the brownies and whether to file felony criminal chargesIn a letter to parents the schools principal Scot Brown warned that there would be serious consequences for students who brought marijuana onto campus But with recreational marijuana now legal in Colorado school officials were bracing for more Marijuana food products Mr Brown wrote will be more readily available to our young peopleTwenty states and the District of Columbia now allow medical marijuana and in 2012 Colorado and Washington State became the first to legalize the drug for recreational use Sales in Colorado began on Jan 1 and have gone smoothly so far regulators say Retail sales in Washington are expected to start this springMarijuana even if consumed by children in high doses poses few of the grave dangers of overdosing on alcohol or drinking household chemicals But doctors said young children who consume marijuana are at risk of falling and hurting themselves or falling asleep in a position where they could not breathe For the most part doctors who treated children in the study advised that the children be watched closely as their bodies digested the drugTheres no antidote no medicine that reverses this Dr Wang saidCompared with the 14 children who were treated after consuming marijuana the hospital treated 48 children who had swallowed acetaminophen  the active ingredient in Tylenol  and 32 who had accidentally taken antihistamines during the same time periodRegulators manufacturers and retailers say they are working intensely to keep marijuana  edible or not  safe and tightly regulated If they fail federal authorities have warned they could step in and take actionSo far the state has given licenses to 34 retail marijuana product manufacturers who extract THCrich oil from marijuana plants to make everything from lip balm and lotion to chocolate candiesTripp Keber the managing partner of Dixie Elixirs and Edibles said his company was fastidious about following the reams of new rules handed down by the state It clearly labels THC content and tells consumers how long it usually takes the drug to activate It sells its wares in silver bags and opaque silver bottles No cartoon characters allowedHaving pink flamingos and grape apes on products is not appropriate Mr Keber saidThe company distributes its products to about 490 medical and retail dispensaries across the state and hopes to expand to Arizona and California Mr Keber wants to reach 23yearold ski lift operators and 73yearold grandmothers But there is one culinary aspiration he does not haveWe do not make a pot brownie he said Its a little clich for us,2014-02-01T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/us/war-pain-yields-to-new-anxiety-at-a-texas-fort.html,KILLEEN Tex   Pastor Randall Wallace of the First Baptist Church of Killeen has watched thousands of troops head off to war and then come home to Fort Hood the mammoth military base that shares this patch of Central Texas with an unpretentious jumble of pawn shops fast food joints and vinylsided bungalowsThese are heroes he reflected and yet they have problems Sometimes its too much alcohol Sometimes its too much stress And then they wind up in the crime section and were burying people he said in the wake of Wednesdays shooting spree by a soldier the second in five years that left four dead and 16 injuredFor a decade Fort Hood which rose from cotton and corn farmlands as a training ground for World War II tank destroyers was like a Grand Central Terminal for waves of troops heading out to Iraq and Afghanistan weekly Soldiers deployed from this selfcontained city where the streets on the base are named Hell on Wheels Avenue and Tank Destroyer Boulevard Then they came back many in need of counselingTo many who live or pass through here this is a primal slice of Americana shaped by patriotism pride and a shared sense of mission a company town where the company is the American military and the heroes are ordinary soldiers It is the kind of town where the Taiwan Dragon Chinese Restaurant about a mile from the base places photos of soldiers  not celebrities  on its wallsBut now the wars are ending and the stress of combat and multiple deployment is being compounded or replaced by new anxieties The number of soldiers assigned to the base has fallen from highs of more than 50000 and could continue to shrink And soldiers many of whom had planned to make a career in the military are looking at an uncertain path A local nonprofit that works for soldiers rights says they are coming in regularly to deal with discharges from the military that have left them with few options for workI dont know what the future holds for our town Killeens mayor Daniel A Corbin saidThe base which sprawls across 340 square miles has an annual economic impact of roughly 25 billion and a footprint as large as Dallas About 41000 soldiers are stationed there and every day thousands of civilian workers drive through its gates to work and veterans head in to exercise at the gym or catch up with old buddiesWhen they talk about Daytona they talk about racing said State Representative Jimmie Don Aycock who represents the area When they talk about Detroit they talk about cars When they talk about Silicon Valley they talk about chips When they talk about Killeen they talk about soldiersBut they have often been troubled soldiers The shooting last week brought back sickening memories of the 2009 rampage on the base in which a former Army psychiatrist Maj Nidal Malik Hasan killed 13 peopleExperts caution against stigmatizing a generation of soldiers with the actions of a few and note that most troubled soldiers are dangers more to themselves than to others But they say demand for mental health services at bases has grown over timeSuicide spousal abuse sexual assault and mental health problems in general are issues that have come to the forefront in the last decade or so that my Army in my day did not see with this level of frequency said Sam Floca Jr 72 who is currently an honorary colonel of the regiment at Fort Hood an unofficial title that he uses to provide a link between past generations of soldiers and current ones It is more acceptable to talk about mental health issues todayAs the wars dragged on and soldiers returned after multiple punishing deployments the pain increasingly has been felt at home though episodes reported to the authorities have receded in recent years Suicides at Fort Hood hit a peak of 22 in 2010 the largest oneyear total on any Army post during the recent wars Last year the Lone Star Legal Aid office recorded 172 militaryrelated family violence cases in a county that includes the base down from 250 in 2010But law enforcement officials and advocates said soldiers were still struggling with the transition back Lt Donnie Adams spokesman for the Bell County Sheriffs Department said there were surges in fatal motorcycle crashes driven by soldiers freshly returned from combat who feel that they are invincibleLegal advocates for soldiers said they were fielding calls from people who had bolted from the base because they felt traumatized after deployments or who were so heavily medicated for pain they struggled to wake up for morning formationsDr Elspeth Cameron Ritchie a longtime Army psychiatrist who is now chief clinical officer for the District of Columbias Department of Mental Health said the wars had taken a toll on the bases soldiers and families In January the husband of a soldier who had recently returned from a deployment to Afghanistan killed the couples two daughters and then himselfFort Hood has placed greater focus on behavioral health issues for soldiers and their families and runs a Resilience and Restoration Center dedicated to helping soldiers deal with combat stress anxiety anger management and other problems on their return And even some victims from 2009 still have fond memories of the base that outweigh the trauma of that dayEven after she was shot four times in the back in that same hail of gunfire Private First Class Amber Gadlin stayed on base at Fort Hood for more than a year and a half Shortly after the November 2009 mass shooting children were back on the playgrounds she recalled Soldiers enjoyed down time riding horses had barbecues and jetskied around a lake on baseAfter a while people started to feel safe again said Ms Gadlin who left the Army in 2011 and is now a stayathome mother in Albuquerque People still felt secureIn the wake of Wednesdays shooting rampage military officials scoured the mentalhealth background of the gunman Specialist Ivan A Lopez who committed suicide after a military police officer confronted him The authorities said Specialist Lopez had been prescribed the sleep aid Ambien and was being treated for depression and anxiety But military officials said there had been no signs he appeared dangerous and they have not found any evidence he had been wounded in combat On Friday they said an argument had precipitated the shootingSome soldiers veterans and elected officials said some personnel on the base should be allowed to carry concealed weapons to defend themselves a position many military leaders and others oppose But few doubt that one of the most troubling aspects of violence on the base is that it comes in a place where soldiers should feel safe after returning from dangerous posts abroadKilleen has a long history of tragedyIn 1991 a merchant seaman who had lost his job for possessing marijuana rammed his car into Lubys Cafeteria in Killeen and opened fire methodically killing 23 people before he shot himself The markers in the nearby veterans cemetery bear witness to Iraqs and Afghanistans outsize toll on the base  519 troops from Fort Hood died in the Iraq war and 56 died in Afghanistan Mr Corbin the mayor said attending solemn memorials and homecomings had become almost a way of lifeAnd with the 2009 shooting still so fresh many in the area were all too familiar with the pattern of shots and sirens On Wednesday the chief medical officer at Scott  White Memorial Hospital which took in nine of the wounded got word of the shooting through a short text message from someone on the post that began Sir it happened againI knew exactly what he was talking about said the doctor Stephen Sibbitt whose hospital is east of Fort Hood and KilleenFor Sgt Jorge Sanchez 29 it provided a somber exit note Sergeant Sanchez said he had survived countless IEDs countless firefights after two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan before returning to Fort Hood where he lives with his wife and two young children and works at a refueling station In November he said he was notified that he was being released from the Army after falling short on a physicalfitness testHe was upset at first but said it was time to move on after 11 years in the military He said he was still haunted by memories of seeing his comrades killed and takes Ambien to get to sleep Sometimes he said his wife hears him cry out in his sleep Theyre shooting at usThe Army has changed he said I cant be a part of thisStill the base and the towns militarydrenched culture offer a sanctuary and a source of pride for many soldiers active and retiredIn November 2009 Sgt Alonzo Lunsford was shot seven times by Major Hasan Sergeant Lunsford now retired lost sight in his left eye and suffers from posttraumatic stress and recurring headaches among other things but he said he had fond memories of handling soldiers at one of the medical centers on baseThen all of a sudden on Nov 5 everything changed he said The reality is this We have security measures in place for a reason Its like flying an airplane Things happen but it is still the safest mode of transportation Fort Hood and other military bases are the same,2014-04-06T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/02/14/us/politics/ap-us-legalizing-marijuana-banks.html,WASHINGTON   The Obama administration on Friday gave banks a road map for conducting transactions with legal marijuana sellers so these new businesses can stash away savings make payroll and pay taxes like any other enterprise Its not clear banks will get on boardGuidance issued by the Justice and Treasury departments is the latest step by the federal government toward enabling a legalized marijuana industry to operate in states that approve it  The intent is to make banks feel more comfortable working with marijuana businesses that are licensed and regulatedOthers have a keen interest too in a regulated financial pipeline for an industry that is just emerging from the underground Marijuana businesses that cant use banks may have too much cash they cant safely put away leaving them vulnerable to criminals And governments that allow marijuana sales want a channel to receive taxesBut a leading financial services trade group immediately expressed misgivings and others too said the guidelines dont go far enough in protecting banksAfter a series of red lights we expected this guidance to be a yellow one said Don Childears president and CEO of the Colorado Bankers Association This isnt close to that At best this amounts to serve these customers at your own risk and it emphasizes all of the risks This light is redWashington and Colorado in 2012 became the first states to approve recreational use of marijuana A group is hoping to make Alaska the third state in the nation to do soCurrently processing money from marijuana sales puts federally insured banks at risk of drug racketeering charges so theyve refused to open accounts for marijuanarelated businessesFridays move was designed to let financial institutions serve such businesses while ensuring that they know their customers legitimacy and remain obligated to report possible criminal activity said the Treasury Departments Financial Crimes Enforcement Network or FinCENBut in response the American Bankers Association said guidance or regulation doesnt alter the underlying challenge for banks As it stands possession or distribution of marijuana violates federal law and banks that provide support for those activities face the risk of prosecution and assorted sanctionsThe group says banks will only be comfortable serving marijuana businesses if federal prohibitions on the drug are changed in lawDenny Eliason a lobbyist for the Washington Bankers Association said it will take some time before banks decide whether to take advantage of the guidance He called it a good first step but said it sets forth a complicated process for the banks to follow  for example by filing suspicious activity reports designated marijuana limited in the case of business that seem to be complying with the rules and marijuana priority for those acting questionablyTheyll have to have a real awareness of the activities of their customers he saidState banking regulators in Colorado and Washington appear to believe that mainly small and mediumsized banks will be interested in handling financial transactions with legal marijuana stores not the big ones a FinCEN official said speaking only on condition of anonymity to talk about internal deliberationsThis is a decision that each financial institution needs to make on its own the official said We feel quite comfortable that we have acted within the scope of our authority and therefore dont expect legal challenges to the new proceduresFinCEN writes the rules that US financial institutions must follow to help protect the system from money laundering and the financing of terrorism The office said it expects financial institutions to perform thorough customer due diligence on marijuana businesses and file reports that will be valuable to law enforcementUnder the guidance banks must review state license applications for marijuana customers request information about the business develop an understanding of the types of products to be sold and monitor publicly available sources for any negative information about the businessAsked about the conflict in federal and state laws on marijuana use the official said the agency sought to balance competing interests One of them is the concern about having so much cash on the street without an ability to get those funds into the safety of a bankThe guidance provided the banks with more than 20 red flags that may indicate a violation of federal law Among them if a business receives substantially more revenue than its local competitors deposits more cash than is in line with the amount of marijuanarelated revenue it is reporting for federal and state tax purposes or experiences a surge in activity by third parties offering goods or services such as equipment suppliers or shipping servicesIf a marijuanarelated business is seen engaging in international or interstate activity such as the receipt of cash deposits from locations outside the state thats a red flag tooIt has been difficult for legal marijuana sellers to operate without banks in the mixIts not just banks that are wary about handling our money its everybody  security businesses lawyers you name it no one wants to take the risk of taking our money said Caitlin McGuire owner of Breckenridge Cannabis Club in Breckenridge ColoMcGuires shop had an account with a local credit union for years but the credit union cut them off last yearThey basically told us they wanted to keep our accounts but it was too big of a risk They were questioned by their auditors Why do you have this marijuana account It just ended up being too much for themThe pot shop now pays its bills with money orders and cash Its not easy McGuire saidIts made it very difficult to pay our bills to pay our employees to pay our taxes to do anything___Associated Press writers Martin Crutsinger and Alicia Caldwell in Washington and Kristen Wyatt in

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/us/more-deportations-follow-minor-crimes-data-shows.html,With the Obama administration deporting illegal immigrants at a record pace the president has said the government is going after criminals gang bangers people who are hurting the community not after students not after folks who are here just because theyre trying to figure out how to feed their familiesBut a New York Times analysis of internal government records shows that since President Obama took office twothirds of the nearly two million deportation cases involve people who had committed minor infractions including traffic violations or had no criminal record at all Twenty percent  or about 394000  of the cases involved people convicted of serious crimes including drugrelated offenses the records showDeportations have become one of the most contentious domestic issues of the Obama presidency and an examination of the administrations record shows how the disconnect evolved between the presidents stated goal of blunting what he called the harsh edge of immigration enforcement and the reality that has played outMr Obama came to office promising comprehensive immigration reform but lacking sufficient support the administration took steps it portrayed as narrowing the focus of enforcement efforts on serious criminals Yet the records show that the enforcement net actually grew picking up more and more immigrants with minor or no criminal recordsInterviews with current and former administration officials as well as immigrant advocates portray a president trying to keep his supporters in line even as he sought to show political opponents that he would be tough on people who had broken the law by entering the country illegally As immigrant groups grew increasingly frustrated the president held a succession of tense private meetings at the White House where he warned advocates that their public protests were weakening his hand making it harder for him to cut a deal At the same his opponents in Congress insisted his enforcement efforts had not gone far enoughFive years into his presidency neither side is satisfiedIt would have been better for the administration to state its enforcement intentions clearly and stand by them rather than being willing to lean whichever way seemed politically expedient at any given moment said David Martin the deputy general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security until December 2010 They lost credibility on enforcement despite all the deportations while letting activists think they could always get another concession if they just blamed Obama It was a pipe dream to think they could make everyone happyVarious studies of court records and anecdotal reports over the past few years have raised questions about who is being deported by immigration officials The Times analysis is based on government data covering more than 32 million deportations over 10 years obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and provides a more detailed portrait of the deportations carried out under Mr ObamaThe demographics of those being removed today are not all that different from those removed over the years Most are Mexican men under the age of 35 But many of their circumstances have changedThe records show the largest increases were in deportations involving illegal immigrants whose most serious offense was listed as a traffic violation including driving under the influence Those cases more than quadrupled from 43000 during the last five years of President George W Bushs administration to 193000 during the five years Mr Obama has been in office In that same period removals related to convictions for entering or reentering the country illegally tripled under Mr Obama to more than 188000The data also reflect the Obama administrations decision to charge immigration violators who previously would have been removed without formal charges In the final year of the Bush administration more than a quarter of those caught in the United States with no criminal record were returned to their native countries without charges In 2013 charges were filed in more than 90 percent of those types of cases which prohibit immigrants from returning for at least five years and exposing those caught returning illegally to prison timeFor years the Obama administrations spin has been that they are simply deporting socalled criminal aliens but the numbers speak for themselves said Marielena Hincapi executive director of the National Immigration Law Center In truth this administration  more than any other  has devastated immigrant communities across the country tearing families away from loved ones simply because they drove without a license or reentered the country desperately trying to be reunited with their family membersAdministration officials say the deportations are a result of a decade in which Congress has passed tougher immigration laws increased funding for enforcement and stymied efforts to lay out a path to legal residency for the bulk of nations 115 million illegal immigrants The president is concerned about the human cost of separating families said Cecilia Muoz the White House domestic policy adviser But its also true that you cant just flip a switch and make it stopIn the spring of 2012 Mr Obama announced a way for illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children  so called Dreamers  to avoid deportation Facing a new wave of protests he announced two weeks ago a review of the administrations deportation programs in an effort to make them more humaneRepublicans immediately pushed back warning that the changes he had already made had weakened enforcement Despite the record deportations they said his shift in emphasis to the border had resulted in a decline in the removals from the interior of the country  a trend borne out by the records And while immigrant advocates and some leading Democrats are outraged by the administrations policy of penalizing illegal entry at the border many Republicans have accused the administration of using those cases to inflate its deportation numbersThe administration has carried out a dramatic nullification of federal law said Senator Jeff Sessions Republican of Alabama Under the guise of setting priorities the administration has determined that almost anyone in the world who can enter the United States is free to illegally live work and claim benefits here as long as they are not caught committing a felony or other serious crimeThe information on 32 million cases obtained from Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE log every removal handled by the agency but do not provide enough information to determine which cases represent repeated deportations of the same personIn places like Painesville Ohio a small town on the shore of Lake Erie sustained for decades by immigrants who work in greenhouses and factories the spate of deportations has been felt one person at a timeAnabel Barron who has lived in the United States for nearly two decades was facing deportation after being stopped for speeding and driving without a license Her record showed that she had been removed previously and she said she returned to be with her four Americanborn children At a regular Tuesday night meeting of immigrants at a converted church she was fretting about her coming hearingI am afraid of being deported she said But for my children its worse They dont sleep the same They dont eat They dont want to go to school because they are afraid I am not going to be there when they get homePromise Collides With RealityDeportations began rising sharply in the final years of the Bush administration Having failed to win comprehensive reform in part because opponents argued that sufficient progress had not been made in securing the borders that administration undertook a sweeping immigration crackdown It stepped up militarystyle raids on factories and farms and granted local police the authority to check the immigration status of foreigners they suspected of being in the country illegally Deportations reached 383000 in 2008Congress supported the moves doubling the immigration agencys budget to 55 billion in 2008 and imposed a mandate that required the immigration agency to detain a daily average of 34000 immigrantsMr Obama attacked those policies during his 2008 campaign saying When communities are terrorized by ICE immigration raids when nursing mothers are torn from their babies when children come home from school to find their parents missing when people are detained without access to legal counsel when all thats happening the system just isnt working He criticized his Republican opponent Senator John McCain of Arizona for abandoning the push for immigration reform when it became politically unpopular and promised to make it a priority in his first year in officeBut that promise collided with the reality of the recession and the bruising fight to get a financial stimulus package through Congress We did stimulus and then as we calculated the rest of the agenda we saw health care as possible energy as sort of possible but super hard and immigration as impossible said a former senior White House official The votes just werent thereLike Mr Bush both Mr Obama and his first Department of Homeland Security secretary the former Arizona governor Janet Napolitano believed that to win comprehensive reform they needed to demonstrate a commitment to enforcing existing laws The Obama administration set out to keep deportation numbers up but to make enforcement smarterImmigration officials set a goal of 400000 deportations a year  a number that was scrawled on a whiteboard at their Washington headquarters The agency deployed more agents to the border according to several former immigration officials where finding and removing illegal immigrants is legally and politically easier The administration attempted to tread more carefully in the interior of the country where illegal immigrants have typically been settled longer It ended the worksite raids and rolled back the local polices broad discretion to check foreigners immigration status Instead it expanded a pilot project started under Mr Bush that required the state and local police to check everyone fingerprinted during an arrestThe change was made partly to address charges of racial profiling but the new program  called Secure Communities  greatly expanded the pool of people who were checked ICE officials said And those found living in the United States illegally could be turned over to the immigration authorities regardless of the charges against themA June 2010 memo from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement director at the time John Morton for the first time set priorities for enforcement They included any immigrants who had entered the country illegally overstayed visas or had ignored prior deportation orders regardless of their criminal history or how long they had lived in the United States Although the memo was meant to focus enforcement the categories were so broad former officials of the immigration agency said that they easily covered a third of the countrys 115 million illegal immigrantsThe administration also broadened the use of expedited proceedings which gave illegal immigrants limited opportunities to consult a lawyer seek asylum or present extenuating circumstances to judges The number of expedited removals nearly doubled from the Bush to the Obama administrations The Obama administration also expanded the pursuit of people who had failed to comply with previous deportation orders And a majority of them involved immigrants who either had no criminal history or had been convicted for immigration or traffic offensesEven as we recognize that enforcing the law is necessary Mr Obama said in a 2011 speech in El Paso we dont relish the pain that it causes in the lives of people who are just trying to get by and get caught up in the systemTorn Families in OhioPainesville Ohio 30 miles east of Cleveland offers a snapshot of some people caught up in the system Every Tuesday night at a nondenominational church downtown several dozen immigrant families cram together to talk about ways they can help loved ones who are either facing deportation or who have already been removed The stories spill out so fast and they all seem to share the same general narrative arc  immigrant drives through red or yellow light police officer asks for drivers license immigrant lands in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody children reel from uncertaintyIts been hard without my husband here said Elizabeth Perez a 35yearold Americanborn woman and a former Marine who briefly served in Afghanistan Her husband was deported to Mexico in June 2010 after the police detained him during a traffic stop and the authorities found 14yearold misdemeanor charges for assault and marijuana possessionAs she spoke her 3yearold son was fidgeting wildly in her arms and tugging on her long hair Her 4yearold daughter had plopped onto the floor and began screaming for her mothers attention We were supposed to do this together she said trying to quiet her restless brood Raise the kids I meanEsperanza Pacheco who said she has lived illegally in the United States for 20 years was detained with her husband three years ago for illegally reentering the country He was deported but he was allowed to return after winning a court fight last year And her deportation has been temporarily suspended Still she said the ordeal hangs over her four daughters The eldest of the girls 16yearold Esmeralda Moctezuma piped up School is hard because we feel like people are pointing at usAn informal tally among the immigrants gathered that recent Tuesday night found a total of 22 people who either had a spouse who had been deported or were in deportation proceedings themselves All told those parents had 59 children All but nine of the children were born in this countryFive of them had fathers who were deported and two of the men had died of exposure in the Arizona desert trying to make it back to their familiesThe last word David Lomelis three children had of their father was the note from forensics officials who found his remains in July 2012 It read Subject was lying on his stomach with his head facing north He was lying on a rippedopen black trash bag The body was in an advanced state of decomposition with the skull fully exposed He was wearing blue jeans no shoes socks or shirt Subject appears to have been at this location for approximately one monthHalf a dozen of the children had dropped out of school to help fill the void left by their fathers deportations Its like a light that was inside of them has gone out said Manuela Martinez referring to her six sonsIn April 2010 an 11yearold girl named Arlette Rocha with long brown hair and a cherubs cheeks was found hanging from the stairway at home in an apparent suicide some eight months after her father was deported to Mexico Her mother had taken a job on the second shift at a local plastics molding factory forcing Arlette to take care of three younger siblingsWhen the family petitioned to have the fathers deportation reversed Dr Archie S Wilkinson who had tried to resuscitate Arlette wrote a letter to authorities pleading with them to return him for the sake of her surviving siblingsDr Wilkinson wrote that in his view Arlette had been suffering from the profound grief of missing her dad and the extra burden placed on her when their familys main support was taken away He ended writing Please give this family a chanceOne teenagers plea reached all the way to the White House Ivan Maldonado 18 who lives in what has become a typical mixedstatus immigrant household was 3 years old when his parents illegally moved him and an older brother to the United States from Mexico His parents had four more sons in Ohio Then in 2010 their father was deported after the authorities found he had failed to obey a previous removal orderHis mother has been allowed to stay to take care of the children and Mr Maldonado and his older brother have been granted temporary legal statusIn 2011 Mr Maldonado who recently dropped out of high school to work at the same factory that once employed his father went on a trip to Washington organized by advocates where he shared his story with Ms Muoz Mr Obamas lead adviser on immigration She told me she would never forget me he recalled It made me feel that maybe there was hope my dad might come homeAnger at ObamaThe issue of deportations has reached the White House repeatedly turning immigration into a contentious issue between Mr Obama and the Hispanic and Asian communities that are a critical part of his political baseWe assumed that a Democratic president who wanted to move immigration reform would not pursue a strategy of deporting the people who he was intent on legalizing said Deepak Bhargava executive director of the Center for Community Change That was a totally wrong assumption And there is a lot of anger about thatOne of the first confrontations played out in March 2010 when immigrant organizations announced plans to hold a march in Washington to demand that Congress pass immigration reform and that Mr Obama stop the expansion of Secure Communities Three former administration officials said the White House quickly began an effort aimed at damage control summoning leading immigrant advocates to meet with the presidentHaving just emerged from a bruising fight for health care reform the president saw the sudden pressure from immigration groups as a betrayal the former aides said But at the White House meeting the advocates also expressed betrayalThey were like This deportation thing is important Families are being ripped apart recalled a former senior White House official who requested anonymity to recount the meeting Theyre almost crying Their faces are turning red Every one of them had a storyChungWha Hong the former executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition recalled that the president kept saying that he was not above the law and that if we were suggesting that he stop enforcing the law then there was no point in continuing the conversation She added We werent asking him not to enforce the law Our point was simply that there were things he could do to protect good people from bad lawsAt some point the former White House official recalled the president made clear he had heard enoughFinally the president was like Hey you know what You dont have to convince me Im dealing with a Congress that wont move on this and the politics theyre looking at wont force them to move the former official said recalling Mr Obamas words and adding So the thing we should spend our time talking about is what can you do and what can I do to change the political calculus The former official said that the meeting ended with Mr Obama and the advocates both angry and the immigration march in Washington went ahead as plannedLast month facing renewed pressure Mr Obama announced that he had ordered his new secretary of homeland security Jeh Johnson to review deportation programs When you hear enough stories about separating families or removing people who are not truly dangerous Mr Johnson said it leads you to want to dig in to make sure youre getting the policy and the implementation rightJanet Murguia the president of the National Council of La Raza the countrys largest Hispanic civil rights organization joined a growing chorus of unions religious groups and immigrant advocacy organizations that have labeled Mr Obama the nations deporter in chief and demanded that he make good on his promises to protect immigrant families from unfair removal policies The pressure has prompted similar calls from leading congressional Democrats including some of Mr Obamas closest allies who are worried about among other things the impact deportations may have on Hispanic turnout in this years midterm electionsAfter ordering the review Mr Obama called the advocates together again While the White House hoped to intensify pressure on Republicans for comprehensive reform the advocates had all but given up hope and have instead directed much of their attention  and outrage  at the administrationMr Obama asked them to skip the stories of pain and suffering not because he did not care but because he felt it more productive to discuss strategy for winning permanent relief people who attended the meeting saidThe odds were not good Mr Obama acknowledged But he asked the advocates to stick with him another 90 days and press hard on Congress If those efforts failed to lead to reform Mr Obama said he would work with them on administrative relief The advocates and others told the president that their communities had waited long enoughWhen the president told us he was going to only go after criminal aliens we all said OK go do that but dont go after people whose only crime is that theyre living here undocumented said Richard Trumka the president of the AFLCIO who attended the meeting But thats not what happened Now immigrant communities are feeling under attack And its hard for them to focus on trying to win reform when theyre afraid they could be pulled over for running a red light and get torn away from their families,2014-04-07T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/travel/scenes-of-india-from-a-fort-and-a-camel.html,The view from atop the nearly 900yearold walls of one of the oldest inhabited forts in the world was distracting to say the least Two hundred and fifty feet below me the sandstone city of Jaisalmer in western Rajasthan resembled an earthen cubist painting of angular cardhouses surrounded by an endless sandandscrub landscape Above it all the evening sky glowed a dusky purpleI had come to Jaisalmer in the midst of the nearly 77000squaremile Thar Desert to explore this ancient part of Rajasthan and go on a threeday camel trek into the wildernessJaisalmer Fort known as Sonar Quila or Golden Fort for the way sun lights its sandstone walls from amber to gold throughout the day was a major draw for my visitBut I soon learned that Jaisalmer has its own charms Though it is dusty the city was a welcome departure from the grimy crush of New Delhi where I had entered the country Jaisalmers narrow streets were filled with vendors trading in handmade leather bags fabrics and finished clothing jewelry spices and countless other textiles Busy yes but there was also a pleasant unrushed feel to the placeAnd the fort accessible by a narrow stone roadway that passes through a series of stone gates did not disappoint Its interior was a labyrinth of alleys dotted with havelis  sandstone buildings hundreds of years old covered from stoop to roof in intricate carvings of gods geometric symbols and mythological depictionsOne morning I explored a group of elaborately sculptured Jain temples inside the fort then hired an autorickshaw to see the dozens of chhatri cenotaphs at a nearby ruin called Bada Bagh in the afternoon But the highlight was sitting on the top of the forts walls just before sunset with a cup of chai to watch children fly kites from nearby roofsOn the evening before my camel trek I spent 30 minutes chatting with Dilip the owner of the governmentlicensed bhang shop around the corner from the outer gate of the fort on a street lined with leather workers The shop sells legal preparations of marijuana in edible or drinkable form Id ordered a bhang lassi thick with ground pistachios saffron black pepper and dairy curd It tasted like Turkish delight in milkshake form Considered at once a medical tonic a sacrament and in some parts of India more socially acceptable than alcohol bhang is as old as the Vedic texts and remains legal and regulated in RajasthanBut a warning Its strong stuff When the bhang finally hit me I was having a hard time holding a conversation with another guest on the roof of our guesthouse After excusing myself I spent the next hours in my room contemplating the vibrating sensations in my body and staring out at the twinkling lights of the city I had been exploring for the last two daysThe next morning I emerged from my room at 530 walked past a few old people and children presumably on their way to work or school and dodged wandering cows in the alleysOutside the office of Adventure Travel Agency two other travelers three guides and I crammed into an old 4 x 4 for the predawn ride into the desert Over the next three days wed forgo showers eat mostly vegetarian meals cooked over a fire and sleep on bedrolls spread out on dunes Everything we needed wed carry with us and all of our trash wed pack outAfter about 45 minutes in the truck we debarked at the side of a road where a halfdozen camels grazed on stubby trees near a temporary camp consisting of a windbreak made from dried sticks and brush A handful of men dressed in tan robes and blankets draped over their shoulders sat around a small fire brewing chaiThe men offered us the tea and a breakfast of hardboiled eggs and freshly made chapati flatbread And then our guides with little instruction other than to lean back when the camels stood up helped us onto our camels We each rode our ownOnce I was in the saddle Deena our 20yearold lead guide made a percussive ckck noise from the side of his mouth abruptly sending the camel up on its hind legs and nearly pitching me over the animals headIt took a couple of hours to get used to the camels swaying jarring gait We left behind the access roads and windmills encroaching on the desert and by lunchtime had entered a primal landscape with alternating areas of rocky and sandy ground punctuated by short squat trees and towering Calotropis bushes whose delicate white and purple flowers our guides warned us leaked a gooey sap that could cause blindnessWe passed by small mudandstraw villages where women were dressed in brilliant red and yellow saris with gold lace details and men wore red green or orange paggar turbans We also passed singlebuilding outposts made from brush that were used by seminomadic people during the rainy season for farming peanuts guar and millet and herding sheep and goatsBy late afternoon as the sun slipped behind the dunes I caught glimpses of wild antelope grazing on dried vegetation And shortly afterward we stopped at a suitable place to make camp a sand dune rising out of the mostly flat landscape like the back of a serpent As with each meal our food curried vegetables millet and wheat chapati and rice was cooked over a wood fire and eaten with bare hands from metal platesExhausted from the long day we unpacked our sleeping rolls I lay supine for a while staring up at a clear sky filled with stars Then I pulled the covers over my head partly because of the cold but mostly because a friend had told me that once on a similar trip he had awakened to find a small pack of wild dogs licking his faceI was awakened by something less startling and decidedly more pleasant one of our guides handing me a cup of sweet firebrewed chai with fresh ginger The dunes were lit a bright orange covered in undulating ridges set by an overnight breeze and crisscrossed by strange tracks that thank goodness I didnt identify as scorpion trails until weeks later when I had a chance to do a search on GoogleWalking around before we departed I found thousands of bleachedwhite spiral seashells about the length of the tip of my pinkieThey are from an old ocean Deena saidThe second day was much like the first but with morefrequent stops at small villages where our guides who had various religious backgrounds would say This one is Muslim or This one is HinduAt each of our stops clustered during the hottest part of the day a goatherd or a few children joined us to share our food and try on our sunglasses At lunch an extended family of 10 led us over a nearby ridge to their small compound where they showed us their fields of guar and peanuts and offered freshly made goat or sheep curdWe found a goat Deena announced as we stopped to set up camp later that evening If you still want it they will bring it here tonight and we can make mutton curry and barbecueFor around 3000 rupees about 50 at 60 rupees to the dollar we bought the whole animal and an older relative of one of our guides slaughtered and butchered the goat according to halal tradition By the time the meat was ready we were three tourists three guides and a halfdozen men from a nearby village sitting around three fires and chatting about our livesWith a full stomach and the fire still crackling I slipped away to my bedroll In the morning Id awake to dozens of peacocks calling from perches in nearby trees and a few wild dogs tails tucked between their legs searching the outskirts of camp for scrapsBut as I lay under the stars after our feast I was more ecstatic than the night I tried bhang and more exhausted than I had been in a long time I stared at the stars and listened to the local men still chattering around the fire And while I remember eventually seeing wispy clouds blot out the stars and hearing the faintest patter of rain so light that the drops evaporated upon reaching the ground I dont remember falling

on Wednesday issued Green the license at its meeting in Olympia on Wednesday launching a new phase in the states ambitious effort to regulate a market that has been illegal for more than 75 yearsGreen who has operated medical marijuana dispensaries in Spokane and the Seattle suburb of Shoreline proclaimed the document beautiful The license will allow him to grow 21000 square feet of cannabis at his Spokane facility  the first pot that will be grown for sale under the highly taxed system approved by voters in 2012 The possession of marijuana became legal for adults over 21 soon after the vote but its still illegal to grow or sell it for recreational use until pot shops open in the state later this yearGreen plans to start by raising marijuana starter plants to sell to other growers and later expand to growing buds for retail pot shopsCannabis prohibition is over Green declared to applause from a room packed with his supporters Im coming home with jobs SpokaneSales began Jan 1 in Colorado the only other state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana But Colorado already had a regulated medical marijuana system and simply began by allowing medical dispensaries to sell recreational

potent cannabis oil as well as flowersThere doesnt seem to be much attention being paid to public health and public safety Franklin saidThe issuance of the first license underscored the hurdles the industry continues to face Pot remains illegal under federal law and despite recent guidance from the US Treasury and Justice departments banks continue to be wary of working with marijuana

his Democratic allies to depict Gardner as a fringe candidate in the mold of Ken Buck a county prosecutor who was the Republican candidate in the states 2010 Senate race Buck was defeated after struggling to explain his decision not to prosecute an alleged rape case and after telling the woman who said she had been attacked that a jury would consider her allegations buyers remorse Buck also

laws in the land of the late reggae musician and cannabis evangelist Bob Marley In Morocco one of the worlds top producers of the concentrated pot known as hashish two leading political parties want to legalize its cultivation at least for medical and industrial useAnd in Mexico City the vast metropolis of a country ravaged by horrific cartel bloodshed lawmakers have proposed a brand new plan to let stores sell the drugFrom the Americas to Europe to North Africa and beyond the marijuana legalization movement is gaining unprecedented traction  a nod to successful efforts in Colorado Washington state and the small South American nation of Uruguay which in December became the first country to approve nationwide pot legalizationLeaders long weary of the drug wars violence and futility have been emboldened by changes in US policy even in the face of opposition from their own conservative populations Some are eager to try an approach that focuses on public health instead of prohibition and some see a potentially lucrative industry in cannabis regulationA number of countries are saying Weve been curious about this but we didnt think we could go this route said Sam Kamin a University of Denver law professor who helped write Colorados marijuana regulations Its harder for the US to look at other countries and say You cant legalize you cant decriminalize because its going on hereThats due largely to a White House thats more open to drug war alternativesUS President Barack Obama recently told The New Yorker magazine that he considers marijuana less dangerous to consumers than alcohol and said its important that the legalization experiments in Washington and Colorado go forward especially because blacks are arrested for the drug at a greater rate than whites despite similar levels of useHis administration also has criticized drug wardriven incarceration rates in the US and announced that it will let banks do business with licensed marijuana operations which have largely been cashonly because federal law forbids financial institutions from processing potrelated transactionsSuch actions underscore how the official US position has changed in recent years In 2009 the US Department of Justice announced it wouldnt target medical marijuana patients In August the agency said it wouldnt interfere with the laws in Colorado and Washington which regulate the growth and sale of taxed pot for recreational useGovernment officials and activists worldwide have taken note of the more open stance Also not lost on them was the Obama administrations public silence before votes in both states and in UruguayIt all creates a sense that the US is no longer quite the drug warobsessed government it was and that other nations have some political space to explore reform said Ethan Nadelmann head of the nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance a prolegalization group based in New YorkAnxiety over US reprisals has previously doused reform efforts in Jamaica including a 2001 attempt to approve private use of marijuana by adults Given Americas evolution the discussion has changed said Delano Seiveright director of Ganja Law Reform CoalitionJamaicaLast summer eight lawmakers evenly split between the ruling Peoples National Party and the opposition Jamaica Labor Party met with Nadelmann and local cannabis crusaders at a luxury hotel in Kingstons financial district and discussed next steps including a nearterm effort to decriminalize pot possessionOfficials are concerned about the roughly 300 young men each week who get criminal records for possessing small amounts of ganja Others in the debtshackled nation worry about losing out on tourism dollars For many weed is synonymous with Marleys home country where it has long been used as a medicinal herb by families including as a cold remedy and as a spiritual sacrament by RastafariansInfluential politicians are increasingly taking up the idea of loosening pot restrictions Jamaicas health minister recently said he was fully on board with medical marijuanaThe cooperation on this issue far outweighs what Ive seen before Seiveright said Both sides are in agreement with the need to move forwardIn Morocco lawmakers have been inspired by the experiments in Washington Colorado and Uruguay to push forward their longstanding desire to allow cannabis to be grown for medical and industrial uses They say such a law would help small farmers who survive on the crop but live at the mercy of drug lords and police attempts to eradicate itSecurity policies arent solving the problem because its an economic and social issue said Mehdi Bensaid a legislator with the Party of Authenticity and Modernity a political party closely allied with the countrys king We think this crop can become an important economic resource for Morocco and the citizens of this regionIn October lawmakers from Uruguay Mexico and Canada converged on Colorado for a firsthand look at how that states law is being implemented They toured a medical marijuana dispensary and sniffed barcoded marijuana plants as the dispensarys owner gave them a tourMexico has outlets like that but guarded by armed men Mexican Congressman Ren Fujiwara Montelongo said afterwardTheres no general push to legalize marijuana in Mexico where tens of thousands have died in cartel violence in recent years But in liberal Mexico City legislators on Thursday introduced a measure to let stores sell up to 5 grams of pot Its supported by the mayor but could set up a fight with the conservative federal governmentRather than continue fighting a war that makes no sense now we are joining a cuttingedge process said Jorge Castaneda a former Mexican foreign ministerOpponents to legalization worry that pot could become heavily commercialized or that increased access will increase youth use They say the other sides political victories have reawakened their causeTheres been a real hunger from people abroad to find out how we got ourselves into this mess in the first place and how to avoid it said Kevin Sabet of Project Smart Approaches to MarijuanaWashington and Colorado passed recreational laws in 2012 to regulate the growth and sale of taxed pot at statelicensed stores Sales began Jan 1 in Colorado and are due to start later this year in Washington Twenty states and the District of Columbia already have medical marijuana lawsA number of US states are considering whether to try for recreational laws Voters in Alaska will have their say on a legalization measure this summer Oregon voters could also weigh in this year and in California drugreform groups are deciding whether to push a ballot measure in 2014 or wait until 2016s presidential election Abroad activists are pushing the issue before a United Nations summit in 2016While some European countries including Spain Belgium and the Czech Republic have taken steps over the years to liberalize pot laws in the face of international treaties that limit drug production to medical and research purposes the Netherlands famous for its pot coffee shops has started to pull back calling on cities to close shops near schools and ban sales to touristsThere is however an effort afoot to legitimize the growing of cannabis sold in the coffee shops While its been legal to sell pot its not to grow it so shops must turn to the black market for their supply which may wind up seized in a raidIn Latin America and the Caribbean where some countries have decriminalized possession of small amounts of drugs from cocaine to marijuana there is significant public opposition to further legalization But top officials are realizing that it is nevertheless on the table despite the longstanding efforts of the US which has provided billions of dollars to support counternarcotics

laws against young people to getting them into treatment He also said after Fernandez appointed him in December that Argentine society is ready to openly debate legalizing marijuana altogetherI believe that Argentina deserves a good debate about this We have the capacity to do it The issue is fundamental for this country Molina said in an interview with Radio del PlataThe pace of change has put American legalization activists in heavy demand at conferences in countries weighing their drug laws including Chile Poland and the Netherlands The advocates including those who worked on the

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/02/09/us/ap-us-medical-marijuana-deep-south.html,ATLANTA   Medical marijuana has been a nonstarter in recent years in the Deep South where many Republican lawmakers feared it could lead to widespread drug use and social ills That now appears to be changing with proposals to allow a form of medical marijuana gaining momentum in a handful of Southern statesTwenty states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana and this year powerful GOP lawmakers in Georgia and Alabama are putting their weight behind bills that would allow for the limited use of cannabis oil by those with specific medical conditions Other Southern states are also weighing the issue with varying levels of supportThe key to swaying the hearts of conservative lawmakers has been the stories of children suffering up to 100 seizures a day whose parents say they could benefit from access to cannabidiol which would be administered orally in a liquid form And proponents argue the cannabis oil is low in tetrahydrocannabinol or THC the psychoactive compound in marijuana that makes users feel highIm an unlikely champion for this cause said Georgia Rep Allen Peake a businessman from Macon who attended the evangelical Dallas Theological Seminary Once people realize its not a 6yearold smoking a joint most folks realize this is the compassionate thing to doPeakes bill has already earned the backing of more than 80 state lawmakers including several members of the House Republican leadership who signed on as cosponsors and the states largest professional association of doctors The bill would revive a longdormant research program allowing academic institutions to distribute the medical cannabis and would be limited in scope tightly restricted well regulated and managed by doctors Peake saidAlabama Rep Mike Ball a retired hostage negotiator for the State Patrol is behind a bill that would allow people to possess the cannabis oil if they have certain medical conditions It passed a key committee vote on WednesdayThe public is starting to understand what this is said Ball who chairs a powerful House committee and is a prominent voice on law enforcement issues The political fear is shifting from what will happen if we pass it to might what happen if we dont Ball saidThe bills in Georgia and Alabama still have more vetting and their ultimate prospects are not certain But what is happening offers a strong signal of whats to come in other statesIn Louisiana although a bill has yet to be introduced a recent committee hearing at the Capitol on legalizing medical marijuana drew a standingroomonly crowd and Gov Bobby Jindal made comments last month indicating he was willing to consider itWhen it comes to medical marijuana  if there is a legitimate medical need Id certainly be open to making it available under very strict supervision for patients that would benefit from that Jindal said according to a report in The AdvocateTechnically both Georgia and Louisiana have laws on the books from the 1980s and 1990s that allow for the use of medical marijuana but those programs essentially ended before they could start Georgias law established the academic research program for those diagnosed with glaucoma and cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation but the program stalled when the federal government stopped delivery of legal cannabisLouisianas law allowed for glaucoma and cancer patients and those suffering from spastic quadriplegia to receive marijuana for therapeutic use but regulations to govern the program were never developedIn Mississippi Republican state Sen Josh Harkins of Brandon is sponsoring a cannabis oil bill similar to the ones in Alabama and Georgia Harkins said one of his constituents has a 20monthold daughter with Dravet syndrome a form of pediatric epilepsy and the oil can help reduce the number of seizuresElsewhere both Kentucky and Tennessee have medical marijuana bills under consideration although they have yet to gain traction Kentucky Senate President Rover Stivers RManchester has said hes not convinced marijuana has legitimate medical purposes and called it an area ripe for abuseIn Florida its likely to become a campaign issue in the fall given that Gov Rick Scott is up for reelection and a proposed constitutional amendment will be on the ballot that would allow for the medical use of marijuana as determined by a licensed physician Former Republican Gov Charlie Crist now a Democrat seeking to challenge Scott has called it an issue of compassion trusting doctors and trusting the people of FloridaMeanwhile Alabama Gov Robert Bentley has signaled a willingness to discuss medicine that might be derived from marijuana with appropriate federal regulationIf someone wants to use the medicine that is in marijuana go through the same testing that you have to go through when you do that through the US Food and Drug Administration you go through all of that do the testing the drug testing thats fine Bentley said last month I have no problem with that I am not just for prescribing marijuanaGeorgia Gov Nathan Deal has declined to take a position but noted the strong case being presented by some of the families with very serious situations involving their childrenDustin Chandler a police officer in Pelham Ala has been a major part of the effort there His daughter 2yearold Carly has three to five seizures each day from a severe neurological condition she has had since infancy Chandler believes cannabidiol could help control his daughters seizures and improve her cognitive functioning based on anecdotal evidence seen elsewhereWeve been battling the stigma from the mword Chandler said Id love to hear my daughter talk Id love to hear her say one word You know that is something most parents take for grantedOverall public opinion in support of legalization has shifted in less than a decade according to William Galston and EJ Dionne who cowrote a paper last year on the topic for The Brookings Institution The authors noted proponents were shrewd in focusing the earliest campaigns on efforts to allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes citing a 2013 Pew Research Center survey that threequarters of Americans including 72 percent of Republicans believe marijuana has legitimate medical usesAmong critics biggest concerns is that allowing medical marijuana even under a narrow list of circumstance would eventually open the door to widespread use Peake the Georgia lawmaker has been adamant that will not be the caseI am concerned as anyone that we would get to a slippery slope of a broader scope of marijuana use in the state Peake said I promise you I will fight that with every bit of energy in meGeorgia Rep Terry England chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee and a deacon at his Baptist church in Auburn is a prime example of a state lawmaker who never thought of legalizing medical marijuana but is now open to it even signing on as a cosponsor to Peakes billIve not made a complete 180degree turn but Im probably at 178 degrees England said___Associated Press writers Kim Chandler

statementTodashev asked to go to the bathroom and then asked for more cigarettes even though he seemed to have plenty in his pack raising worries that he was trying to minimize the number of law

US citizenship a federal judge ruled Wednesday in a decision that could encourage other Republicanled states to consider similar policiesUS District Judge Eric Melgren in Wichita Kan ordered the US Election Assistance Commission to immediately modify a national voter registration form to add special instructions for Arizona and Kansas residents about their states proofofcitizenship requirementsBoth require new voters to provide a birth certificate passport or other documentation to prove their US citizenship to election officials The federal registration form requires only that prospective voters sign a statement declaring they are citizensKansas and Arizona asked the federal agency for statespecific modifications but it refused The states and their top elected officials  Secretaries of State Kris Kobach of Kansas and Ken Bennett of Arizona both conservative Republicans  sued the agency last yearMost voters in both states register with state forms but their officials said the availability of the federal form created a loophole in enforcement of proofofcitizenship requirements Supporters argue the requirements preclude voter fraud by preventing noncitizens from voting particularly those in the country illegallyThis is a really big victory not just for Kansas and Arizona but for all 50 states Kobach told The Associated Press Kansas has paved the way for all states to enact proofofcitizenship requirementsArizona enacted its proofofcitizenship requirement by voter initiative in 2004 and Alabama Georgia and Kansas followed with similar laws Kansas rule took effect last yearCritics of such laws view them as suppressing voter participation They also said the federal National Voter Registration Act enacted in the 1990s was meant to simplify registration across the country and allowed federal officials to reject a modification of the national formJonathan Brater legal counsel for the New Yorkbased Brennan Center for Justice said Melgrens ruling if it stands would erode Congress power to protect voting rights The center represented the national League of Women Voters and its Arizona and Kansas chapters which intervened in the lawsuitThere is a concern that other states could move to pass some of these misguided laws Brater said There can be a copycat effectMelgren said the US Constitution gives states the power to set voter qualifications and Congress has not preempted it even in enacting the 1990s lawThe federal commission and the national League of Women Voters were reviewing the decision Wednesday and not saying whether theyd appeal to the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals in DenverBut league President Elisabeth MacNamara said Our first impression is that its a harsh decision and its a decision that will harm votersThe federal commission also had rejected a request for a statespecific change in the national form from Georgia and Jared Thomas chief of staff to Secretary of State Brian Kemp said his state will ask the commission to reconsiderWe applaud Judge Melgrens decision and the good work of Kansas and Arizona in litigating this important issue Thomas said in an email to the APThe proofofcitizenship laws are part of broader attempt by Republicans nationally to tighten up state voting requirements in the name of fighting election fraudWe must ensure citizens are the only ones who vote if we are to have honest elections said Republican Alabama state Sen Scott BeasonBut critics contend it can be difficult for some poor minority and elderly voters to obtain copies of their birth certificates or other citizenship documentsBrater said college students registering to vote away from their previous homes also may have trouble finding the necessary papers quickly And Democratic Arizona state Sen Steve Gallardo who joined the lawsuit on the side of the federal commission said a proofofcitizenship requirement is designed to weed out progressive voters particularly college studentsThese are new voters that are getting active Gallardo said They tend to be a lot more progressive and liberal  particularly when it comes to issues like medical marijuana samesex marriage more progressivetype issuesIn Kansas the registrations of nearly 15700 prospective voters  enough to decide a close statewide race  remained on hold Wednesday because they hadnt yet complied with the proofofcitizenship requirementKobach said the state has found 20 or so noncitizens on its voter registration rolls but he believes thats only a fraction of the potential number Kansas has about 173 million registered votersIn Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne another conservative Republican said election officials learned they had more than 200 noncitizens on their rolls when court officials forwarded the names of people who sought exemptions from jury duty because they werent citizens Arizona has 325 million registered votersTheres been a coverup by the media of the extent to which voter fraud is a problem

of Colombia or FARC could sink him deeper into poverty even if it ends almost daily firefights in the areaWe pray for an end to the violence but not at any cost 61yearold Escue says as he hunches over the bright green coca scrub in Toribio a rebel stronghold that processes the leaves into cocaine They want us to switch to crops that wont bring enough money to feed a family we cant do thatThree months before the presidential election government envoys and FARC commanders are working through the third item on a fivepoint peace agenda  the illegal drugs industry and how to rid Colombia of cocaNegotiations to end the conflict that has killed more than 200000  mostly civilians  since the 1960s is a campaign battleground ahead of the first round of voting on May 25President Juan Manuel Santos is favored to win a second term and continue the peace talks that began in 2012 although he will be hard pressed to match his comfortable victory in 2010 given criticism of the talks and his economic policiesThis is the first election held during a peace process so convincing farmers like Escue and others that an end to the conflict will also bring jobs is keyThe scion of one of Colombias most powerful families Santos says investors are awaiting the talks outcome before pouring cash into the Andean nationHis biggest challenge comes from rightwing contender Oscar Ivan Zuluaga an ally of conservative former President Alvaro Uribe who says he would scrap the FARC talks Leftist candidate Clara Lopez Marta Lucia Ramirez of the Conservative Party and Enrique Penalosa from the Green Alliance will also runSantos is seeking to compensate millions of people displaced by the war and has returned land stolen by the FARC and rightwing paramilitaries The measures helped bring the rebels to the negotiating table although many of those he has pledged to help are unlikely to vote for himFarmers from across the country last year led violent protests against a freetrade deal with the United States and other reforms they say have left them even poorer than beforeCoca farmers worry they will be pushed into growing coffee rubber or cacao which they say require additional workers costly fertilizers and generate less incomeWe only just make ends meet with coca says Escues sister Teresa of the weed which needs little water and can earn double what legal crops do for each of its three annual harvestsIt also has a regular buyer in the FARC which sends rebels to farms such as Escues to purchase the leavesNegotiators at the peace talks in Cuba have already reached partial agreement on agricultural reform and rebel participation in politics Still on the agenda is an end to the conflict  including a ceasefire  and reparations for war victimsWhile most Colombians are desperate for peace many are wary of how much Santos is willing to offer the rebels for them to put down their weapons That may play against him in the electionZuluaga and Uribe  a onetime Santos ally  are furious that FARC leaders could be handed light sentences for their crimes and perhaps even given seats in CongressWe wont accept that FARC leaders who have killed soldiers and police in cold blood recruited children kidnapped and extorted  killed defenseless Colombians  are awarded a place in Congress tomorrow Zuluaga told ReutersAlmost a third of voters still say they will not mark the ballot for any candidate pollster Gallup said recentlyOFF LIMITSThe wartorn region of Cauca remains off limits for most Colombians Violence can flare at any time forcing villagers to hide and dodge bullets and the rebels homemade cylinder bombsTwothirds of Caucas 14 million people live on 3 a day and dirt roads to market are frequently washed away Subsistence farmers depend on growing coca to surviveMany here sympathize with the FARC trade with it and have family in its ranks They have little faith in the government and are deeply skeptical about peace talks and the electionIts all just empty promises ahead of the vote What will peace really bring here There are no jobs to replace coca and other crime gangs will just move in after the FARC leave said Manuel Bonilla 62 who lost his right arm when the rebels detonated a bus bomb in Toribios central squareIm voting blankBonillas wife Marta Lucia scratches a living by trimming and bagging marijuana on the porch of her crumbling adobe shack She feeds her family of seven with sugar water plantain and rice with the 250 she is paid dailyI wish Id died That way there would be one less mouth to feed says Bonilla struggling to mend an old motor with a hook fixed to his stump This election will bring us nothing newAs an outlet to the Pacific Cauca is used by the FARC and criminal groups as a corridor to smuggle cocaine and marijuana to Central America and Mexico and then to the United StatesThe FARC is believed to control about 60 percent of cocaine output in Colombia one of the worlds biggest producers netting the rebels as much as 1 billion a year the government says FARC leaders deny involvement in drug trafficking but accept their role in coca productionFounded in 1964 as a Marxist movement that fought to defend the poor the FARC later turned to cocaine kidnapping and extortionAt its height the FARC had some 20000 fighters but a USfunded military offensive has whittled them to as few as 7000While details of negotiations in Havana remain secret the government has said it wants total eradication of the coca cropCritics question how the government would teach new skills or fund subsidies for hundreds of thousands of coca farmersSantos has suggested he would help farmers substitute coca for coffee fruits and pepper and that peace would attract fresh private sector investment meaning new jobsIts evident that the eradication or substitution of coca will have a cost because the families that are in this activity should have an alternative They cant be put in a vulnerable position Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas told Reuters But with the same logic we can say that there are resources that today we are using for war that we could redirect to peaceAbout two hours down winding roads from Toribio sugar cane companies such as Bengala Agricola are waiting for the outcome of the talks before making milliondollar investments to switch to pineapple cultivationSafety concerns are vital says Bengala executive Mauricio Lopez since pineapple requires more ontheground managementWe could double the hectarage planted with pineapple to 200 by the end of 2014 he says of the plantation close to Pradera where two months ago the FARC killed a civilian and injured 30 in a motorbike bomb It depends totally on the peace processMilitary leaders in the area say social change is key to a lasting peace no matter who wins the electionColonel German Lopez commander of the heavily guarded 14th mobile brigade stationed in Caloto says his work is 60 percent social and 40 percent militaryIts logical and understandable that they dont believe in the peace process said Lopez dressed in battle fatigues But they have to understand that the world is changing and they have to create a new

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/20/nyregion/new-york-courts-meet-elusive-goal-from-arrest-to-arraignment-in-under-24-hours.html,For two decades court officials in New York City have struggled to solve a vexing problem reducing the arresttoarraignment time in its criminal courtsPeople arrested in the city would typically spend a full day and night behind bars before making a court appearance even for fairly minor infractions that typically resulted in little or no bailBut in the last year and a half New York has made remarkable strides For the first time since 2001 the average time it takes to bring a defendant before a judge for arraignment fell last year to below 24 hours in all five boroughs The 24hour benchmark had been set by the states highest court in a pivotal 1991 decision but it proved mostly elusive especially in the Bronx and BrooklynThe solution according to many criminal justice officials can largely be traced to a computertracking initiative spearheaded by Judge George A Grasso a former first deputy commissioner in the Police Department who was put in charge of arraignment courts in April 2012  as well as the discovery of a cache of unused scanners that were bought to track case filesJudge Grassos inspiration was CompStat a crimetracking system introduced in New York in the 1990s during William J Brattons first stint as police commissioner CompStat was widely credited with helping drive crime numbers down by using computers to pinpoint highcrime problem areas allowing the department to direct police officers toward specific outbursts of criminal activityIt popped into my head Judge Grasso said I said Wow we could turn our arraignment parts into mini CompStat sessions Now judges clerks police officers defense lawyers and prosecutors  all the parties involved in the complex dance necessary to bring charges against a citizen  have computer screens tracking cases going through arraignment courts from the time the police and prosecutors bring the complaint to docket clerks to the time the defendant is standing in front of a judge with a lawyerThe system perhaps inevitably called CourtStat went into operation citywide in the summer of 2013 and arresttoarraignment times have dropped sharplyThe citywide average of 214 hours in 2013 was the lowest in decades and the declines are most pronounced in Brooklyn and the Bronx where as recently as February 2012 detainees waited on average for about 32 hours before seeing a judge Brooklyns time declined to about 22 hours while the Bronx fell to just under 24 hoursJudge Grasso said he learned of the unused scanners at one of the first staff meetings he held after being put in charge of speeding up arraignmentsMelding the scanners with new software court officials could track cases identify slowermoving ones and pinpoint the reasons Computerized graphs now tell everyone involved in the arraignment court which link in the process  the police corrections officers docket clerks defense lawyers or prosecutors  needs to move fasterNobodys guessing anymore said Michael J Yavinsky the judge in charge of arraignments in Brooklyn You can see whats flowing and whats not flowing and its very easy to spot the solutionThe problem is not unique to New York though few American cities match it in terms of volume New York processed about 225000 arrests in 2013In 1957 the United States Supreme Court ruled in Mallory v United States that arraignments should take place without unnecessary delay and most states subsequently adopted statutes with similar language In practice times vary widely Criminal courts in Houston and Los Angeles for instance have 48 hours under state law to arraign people on felony chargesIn New York the State Court of Appeals placed the bar at 24 hours in its ruling in People v Roundtree interpreting without unnecessary delay to mean 24 hours under normal conditions Damon Roundtree suspected of shoplifting had been held for 51 hours before he saw a judgeDonna Lieberman the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union said the drop in arresttoarraignment time was encouraging but misleading because some people were still being held longer than 24 hours This doesnt mean the problem is solved by a long shot Ms Lieberman saidNonetheless Judge Barry M Kamins the administrator for New York Citys criminal courts who assigned Judge Grasso to the assignment backlog said the system worked mostly because it shined a light on clogs in the pipeline Gone are the mysterious lulls in action that used to occur regularly during which the police prosecutors and court officials would blame one anotherEveryone would look around and point in this direction or that Judge Kamins said No one really knew what the answer wasJudge Yavinsky keeps two computer monitors running on his bench one showing the progress of cases through the arraignment courts and one with information about cases the police and prosecutors are still preparingLikening himself to an airtraffic controller he constantly scans the lists of defendants for any case that has been lingering for more than 20 hours Then he picks up a telephone to find out why On a recent morning he asked the police to locate one case stalled for more than 24 hours It turned out the defendant had been sent to the wrong courthouseThats a perfect example he saidBeyond electronic tracking Judge Grasso used his influence with police commanders to persuade them to prioritize moving defendants to the courthouse more quickly As a former deputy police commissioner for legal affairs Judge Grasso had credibility with police officialsGrasso knew the system and we couldnt put a net over his head and give him excuses said Assistant Chief Gerald Nelson the commander of Patrol Borough Brooklyn NorthPushed by the judge Chief Nelson said he determined the biggest reason for delays was the practice of using squad cars to take prisoners to court so he dedicated two prisoner vans to act as a shuttle service for the busiest precincts He also ordered commanders in each precinct to report to him whenever a detainee was held longer than eight hours The police in Brooklyn have shaved three hours off the average time it takes for them to deliver sworn complaints to the docket clerksJust before court started on a recent Thursday Judge Yavinsky was moving through misdemeanor cases at a rapid clip keeping one eye on the charts on his computer In the docket room officers dropped off bundles of complaints and rap sheets while clerks gave them docket numbers and checked for outstanding warrants One clerk slapped bar code stickers on the packets used to track themWrapped with a rubber band the packets were taken to the arraignment courtroom where police officers matched them with slips for each defendant who had been brought from precincts to holding pens Defense lawyers picked up the packets and went to the pens to interview defendantsTim McGrath a senior clerk moved around the court the docket room and pens with quiet efficiency keeping the flow moving I compare it to being a ringmaster of a circus he said Only you dont have that much control of certain thingsAt 10 am Rayvone Gibson 19 was arraigned on charges he had used someone elses school MetroCard to ride the subway The police had picked him up at 6 pm the day before he was released on his own recognizanceHe said he had been arrested three times before for little stuff marijuana mostly but had never been released sooner than 24 hoursThis is the fastest time I ever spent here Mr Gibson said Usually it takes a day or two You could be sitting there all day and not see your lawyer,2014-03-20T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/03/07/world/europe/ap-eu-rethinking-pot-netherlands.html,MAASTRICHT Netherlands   A young man at a bus stop hisses at a passerby What you looking for  marijuana Its a scene of street peddling that the Netherlands hoped to stamp out in the 1970s when it launched a policy of tolerating coffee shops where people could buy and smoke pot freelyBut Maastrichts street dealers are back local residents complain And the reason is a crackdown on coffeeshops triggered by another problem Pot tourists who crossed the border to visit the cafes and made a nuisance of themselves by snarling traffic dumping litter and even urinating in the streetsThis exchange of one drug problem for another has become a headache for Maastricht  and may give reason for pause in the US states of Washington and Colorado that recently allowed the sale of marijuana for the first time The Netherlands the world pioneer in pot liberalization has recently taken a harder line toward marijuana with mixed results seen particularly in border towns such as MaastrichtThe central government clampdown has involved banning people who live outside the Netherlands from coffee shops and shuttering shops that are deemed to be too close to schools There was even a shortlived policy that said smokers had to apply for a Weed Pass to get into a coffee shop The new rules were rolled out across the country between the middle of 2012 and the beginning of last yearBut while the central government made the rules its up to local municipalities to enforce them  and most are embracing only part of the policyAmsterdam  with some 200 licensed coffee shops onethird of the nationwide total  still lets foreigners visit them although it is closing coffee shops that are near schoolsOne city that has embraced the crackdown wholeheartedly is Maastricht in the southern province of Limburg close to the Dutch borders with Belgium and GermanyIts mayor Onno Hoes says he enforced the legislation to halt a daily influx of thousands of foreigners who crossed the borders to stock up on pot at its 14 coffee shops That effort to end socalled drug tourism has been successful local residents say but the flip side has been a rise in street dealers like the man who recently tried to sell pot to an AP reporter in MaastrichtCarol Berghmans lives close to the River Maas whose muddy waters bisect the city and whose banks are frequented by dealers he sees as he walks his dog each dayHe says there were certainly problems before the crackdown as cars filled with pot tourists poured into the cobbled streets of central Maastricht  but he described the atmosphere as gezellig a Dutch word that loosely translates as cozy or convivialSince coffee shops were banned from selling to nonresidents the numbers of foreigners has dried up But the atmosphere in town has turned darker as street dealers now aggressively badger any potential clients and fight among themselves Berghmans saysNow the drug runners are trying to sell on the street to anyone he says They are bothering everybodyMaastricht city spokesman Gertjan Bos said the problem of street dealing is not new but concedes it has become more visible since the citys crackdown reduced the number of drug touristsWe have a feeling our approach is working Bos said but we do still have to work on the street dealersEasy Going coffee shop in a street linking Maastrichts historic market square with the Maas has been shut for months as its owner Marc Josemans refuses to adhere to the rule about selling only to Dutch residentsI wont discriminate he explains He is fighting a legal battle against the new rules and expects the Dutch Supreme Court to issue a ruling soon on whether turning away nonDutch residents is constitutionalExperts also question the Dutch policy changeAugust de Loor has for years run a bureau in Amsterdam that gives drug advice aimed at minimizing health risks for users as well as testing party drugs such as ecstasy for purityHe says coffee shops once played an important role not only in keeping cannabis users away from hard drugs like heroin but also educating them about safely using pot and providing a meeting place for people who would rather smoke a joint than drink a beerThat special element of the Dutch model makes coffee shops unique in the world he said and that is gradually fading awayOne part of the Dutch drug experience that has remained illegal is commercial cultivation of weed Meaning that while coffee shops are tolerated  and taxed  the people who supply them are notIn January a group of 35 municipalities including both Amsterdam and Maastricht called on the central government to allow regulated growing saying it would take the harvest out of the hands of organized crimeThe Dutch Justice Minister Ivo Opstelten was blunt in his rejection Im not doing it he said The mayors have to live with itProf Dirk Korf a criminologist at the University of Amsterdam says the Dutch tolerance policy has worked wellThe clear success is that there is regulated supply to users without having a strong effect on the prevalence on use itself he said One could be afraid that more people would use cannabis that has not been the caseJo Smeets a former coffee shop worker in Maastricht complains his neighborhood has been overrun by dealers since the citys crackdown The dealers he says sell drugs on the streets to people who previously would have bought in tightly controlled coffee shops Now they can buy more and they can buy hard drugs from the same dealersAmsterdams coffee shops by contrast continue to welcome foreigners with open armsThe main difference between the two cities is the type of tourist they attract In Maastricht foreigners drive over the border visit a coffee shop and drive back on the same day In Amsterdam tourists mostly arrive by plane or train stay in a hotel and visit museums and restaurants  as well as dropping in on a coffee shop  plowing far more cash into the cityOn a recent Friday afternoon in the Dutch Flowers coffee shop on Amsterdams historic Singel canal German and American voices mingled with English and Dutch in a hazy cloud of pot smokeShawn Stabley a 49yearold musician and IT director from York Pennsylvania is typical of the type of tourist Amsterdam coffee shops attractHe and his partner strolled into Dutch Flowers for a smoke after visiting another Amsterdam icon the Anne Frank House museum a short walk away on another of the citys canals The cafe has a few tables a bar with a set of electronic scales for weighing out drugs and a menu filled with names of marijuana and hashish like Nevilles Haze and Parvati CremeThe couple has been visiting the city for 20 years to celebrate Thanksgiving Stabley says He says they dont plan to stop the tradition now even if he can buy pot closer to home in Denver or SeattleEvery window is picturesque Stabley said and coming here to places that serve hash and marijuana just enhances that and prolongs it,2014-03-07T07:55:40Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/us/banks-say-no-to-marijuana-money-legal-or-not.html,SEATTLE   In his secondfloor office above a hair salon in north Seattle Ryan Kunkel is seated on a couch placing 1000 bricks of cash  dozens of them  in a rumpled brown paper bag When he finishes he stashes the money in the trunk of his BMW and sets off on an adrenalized drive downtown darting through traffic and nervously checking to see if anyone is following himDespite the air of criminality there is nothing illicit in what Mr Kunkel is doing He coowns five medical marijuana dispensaries and on this day he is heading to the Washington State Department of Revenue to commit the ultimate in lawabiding acts paying taxes After about 25 minutes at the agency Mr Kunkel emerges with a receipt for 51321Carrying such large amounts of cash is a terrible risk that freaks me out a bit because there is the fear in my mind that the next car pulling up beside me could be the crew that hijacks us he said So we have to play this neverending shell game of different cars different routes different dates and different timesLegal marijuana merchants like Mr Kunkel  mainly medical marijuana outlets but also starting this year shops that sell recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington  are grappling with a pressing predicament Their businesses are conducted almost entirely in cash because it is exceedingly difficult for them to open and maintain bank accounts and thus accept credit cardsThe problem underscores the patchwork nature of federal and state laws that have evolved fitfully as states have legalized some form of marijuana commerce Though 20 states and the District of Columbia allow either medical or recreational marijuana use  with more likely to follow suit  the drug remains illegal under federal law The Controlled Substances Act enacted in 1970 classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug the most dangerous category which also includes heroin LSD and ecstasyAs a result banks including statechartered ones are reluctant to provide traditional services to marijuana businesses They fear that federal regulators and law enforcement authorities might punish them with measures like large fines for violating prohibitions on moneylaundering among other federal laws and regulationsBanking is the most urgent issue facing the legal cannabis industry today said Aaron Smith executive director of the National Cannabis Industry Association in Washington DC Saying legal marijuana sales in the United States could reach 3 billion this year Mr Smith added So much money floating around outside the banking system is not safe and it is not in anyones interest Federal law needs to be harmonized with state lawsThe limitations have created unique burdens for legal marijuana business owners They pay employees with envelopes of cash They haul Chipotle and Nordstrom bags containing thousands of dollars in 10 and 20 bills to supermarkets to buy money orders When they are able to open bank accounts  often under false pretenses  many have taken to storing money in Tupperware containers filled with air fresheners to mask the smell of marijuanaThe allcash nature of the business has also created huge security concerns for business owners Many have installed panic buttons for workers in the event of a robbery and have set up a constellation of security cameras at their facilities beyond what is required as well as floor sensors to detect breakins In Colorado Blue Line Protection Group was formed a few months ago specializing in protecting dispensaries and facilities that grow marijuana and in providing transportation security The firm largely uses military veterans who have Special Operations experienceMarijuana business owners have devised strategies to avoid the suspicions of bankers A number of legal operations have opened accounts by establishing holding companies with names that obscure the nature of their business Some owners simply use personal bank accounts Others have relied on local bank managers willing to take chances and bring them on as clients or even offer tips on how to choose nondescript company namesBut the financial institutions eventually shut down many of these accounts after managers conclude the businesses are too much of a risk It is not unusual for a legitimate marijuana business to go through a halfdozen bank accounts in a few years While they are active however these accounts may have informal restrictions placed on them  some selfimposed  so they do not draw the scrutiny of bankers who may file suspiciousactivity reports or would be required to report deposits over 10000 in cash The account holders may make only small deposits and only at night and at certain branches Mr Kunkel of Seattle has such an accountAt the largest credit union in Washington State BECU about 20 accounts have been shut down in the last three years after it was discovered they were for businesses in the legal marijuana trade Todd Pietzsch a spokesman for the credit union saidKristi Kelly 36 who owns two dispensaries and several marijuana growing operations in the Denver area said six bank accounts of hers had been canceled in the last 18 months Opening the account is not necessarily the problem she said Our cash deposit levels flag a banks compliance divisionMs Kelly who had just paid 10000 in cash to the City of Denver for licensing and application fees to expand her business said that several times a week she carried around tens of thousands of dollars in a bag I never felt as illegitimate as the day I had to buy a cash counter she said adding that she spends three hours or so a day just managing the cash from her businesss multiple locationsATMs are common in marijuana outlets but the business owners often have to use their own cash in the machines in case law enforcement authorities conduct a raid and seize the moneyThose marijuana operations that do have bank accounts or use the personal ones of their owners can use a cashless ATM service in which a debit card is swiped at a dispensary and the money is transferred into the recipients accountIt is operating over the ATM network and not the credit card network said Lance Ott whose company Guardian Data Systems provides this service The ATM networks are not as regulated This is the loopholeSince legal marijuana operations for the most part cannot get bank loans these small businesses have to rely on shortterm loans from individuals usually with higher interest ratesTo help High Times magazine is starting a private equity fund to invest in marijuana businesses But many investors may feel uneasy about marijuana businesses that do not have bank accounts And without bank references entrepreneurs say it is much tougher to get lines of credit from vendorsLeaders in the marijuana trade point out that giving accounts to businesses would allow for more transparency and meticulous regulation and would help ensure that jurisdictions receive the taxes they are entitled toMarijuana entrepreneurs and banks both would like clear guidelines from the government on how financial institutions can serve the industry On Friday six members of Colorados congressional delegation sent a letter to the Treasury and the Justice Department requesting that they expedite that guidanceIn August the Justice Department issued a memo indicating that it would not crack down on legal marijuana as long as eight regulatory requirements were met like preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises and preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors The memo did not address bankingThe Treasury Departments Financial Crimes Enforcement Network hopes to circulate recommendations by the end of this month to officials at the Treasury and the Justice Department for their opinions an official briefed on the situation said There is no timetable for formal guidelinesRichard Riese senior vice president for regulatory compliance at the American Bankers Association said banks wanted clear and comprehensive guidelines on how to do business with the legal marijuana industryMr Riese said for instance that banks would want to know that they were not aiding and abetting a criminal enterprise if they provided services to marijuana businesses Banks will need a lot of detail from regulators to get the satisfaction and comfort they are looking for he said,2014-01-12T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/02/06/the-quick-rise-and-abrupt-fall-of-a-bitcoin-champion/,A few weeks before his arrest at Kennedy Airport Charles Shrem was standing behind the Manhattan bar he invested in with some of his Bitcoin fortune buzzing about his big plans for the virtual currency and himselfWith the frenetic pace of a sports announcer Mr Shrem the cofounder of a popular website where Bitcoins could be bought using dollars jumped between his idea for a Bitcoin debit card his recent conversations with the owners of a private jet company who wanted to take payment in Bitcoin his goal of unifying the countrys money transfer laws and his travel plans to just about every corner of the world including the trip to Amsterdam he was returning from when he was arrested last weekBitcoin really allows you to have such a global life  it allows you to be able to move anywhere within days if you want to the scruffily bearded Mr Shrem said standing in front of the sign announcing that the bar EVR would accept BitcoinThese days though Mr Shrems exploits in Bitcoin have him restricted to his parents home in Brooklyn where he awaits trial on federal charges that he smoothed the way for drug transactions online Mr Shrem was also accused of buying marijuana himself He has pleaded not guiltyThe 24yearold Mr Shrem who went through millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin over the years is not the first person in the virtual currency world to end up in handcuffs but he is the most central player to face charges His recent reversal of fortune  and the meteoric ascent that led up to it  makes him a living symbol of the peaks and valleys that have so far defined the Bitcoin experience as the value of all the outstanding coins has shot above 10 billionThe virtual currency  digital money that can be traded between online wallets using virtual keys  has given rise to worldchanging ambitions newmoney fortunes and global jetsetting But all the high living has often seemed just a hairbreadth away from a police raid or government crackdownIn an interview on Thursday Mr Shrem said that particularly during the early days of Bitcoin it often was not clear what was right and wrongYou had so many bad things going on and so little good that you had to dive down into it to bring it up he said For his own part he acknowledged back then I wasnt as educated on what was legal and what was not legalThe uncertainty stems in no small part from the lack of clarity about what laws apply to Bitcoin transactions  and the relative lack of interest from law enforcement But in addition to that uncertainty Bitcoins troubles have arisen from its tendency to attract maverick characters who want to test the established order Before his arrest Mr Shrem talked about his difficulties with traditional banksI dont actually have a bank account he said with an impish grin that he has flashed during many speaking engagements No real bank would bank meJerry Brito a senior fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University said that Mr Shrem was quite a compelling story  a sort of ragstoriches story made possible through BitcoinBut Mr Brito said many of the early entrepreneurs may not have had the proper tools for the world they were enteringThese people were not ready for what they found themselves in the middle of Mr Brito saidSince Mr Shrems arrest some of the top figures in the Bitcoin world have distanced themselves from his activities The Bitcoin Foundation where Mr Shrem was vice chairman said in a statement after he resigned that it was worth noting that the indictment itself is not against Bitcoin or the community at largeBut a few have come to his support Roger Ver an early investor in Mr Shrems company said that Mr Shrem was a trustworthy person who would never commit a crime in which there is a victimNearly everyone who knows Mr Shrem agrees that he was a charismatic salesman for Bitcoin from almost the first moment he encountered the digital moneyMr Shrem has said that he began dabbling in Bitcoin during his final year at Brooklyn College in 2011 He had grown up in Brooklyn graduated from Yeshiva of Flatbush a private Jewish school and founded a startup during his first years in collegeBut Bitcoin quickly became his passionI became obsessed he told the website MeetInnovators last yearHe quickly realized how hard it was to exchange dollars into Bitcoin and so he helped found his company BitInstant with another early adopter he met online To raise money for BitInstant Mr Shrem turned on all his salesman charms even with his motherI said Mom I love this idea and I put all my money into it and were growing so quickly  he said during an interview last year with the Russianowned television station RT She wrote me a check that dayHe used similar powers of persuasion with Mr Ver and the Winklevoss brothers of Facebook fame who helped lead a 15 million fundraising roundThe brothers have said since Mr Shrems arrest that We were passive investors in BitInstant and will do everything we can to help law enforcement officialsMr Shrems charisma quickly took him beyond the bounds of his company He was a founding member of the Bitcoin Foundation board He became a regular speaker at Bitcoin events And he made an investment in Bitcoin in EVR the bar founded by a few friends which became a regular site for Bitcoin parties He lived with the other owners in a fivebedroom apartment above the bar and hung out with his girlfriend who sometimes worked as a bartender downstairsA profile of Mr Shrem last year on the website Vocativ said that in the middle of all this Mr Shrem never stopped having fun According to the article Mr Shrem said I wont hire you unless I drink with you or smoke weed with youMr Shrem said this week that the comment was taken out of context and was only a joke But he has never been shy about how widely he ranged in the Bitcoin world During the recent interview at EVR he recounted a conversation with a former financial regulator She was like Charlie you and some of your friends have become such super experts in finance law and the Patriot Act and all these things And Im like Its Bitcoin  he saidIn the end it was his basic business that got him in trouble The indictment on moneylaundering charges filed on Jan 27 contends that he helped exchange dollars into Bitcoin for people who wanted to buy drugs on the online bazaar Silk Road despite knowing their intent and being warned by his business partnerThe charges were surprising given that Mr Shrem often appeared at Bitcoin events talking about how to trade Bitcoin legally At a Bitcoin conference last year he boasted that BitInstant was going to be the shining city on the hillWere going to be the company that succeeded in the United States he said Worked with governments Worked with banks Did complianceAt the same time Mr Shrem acknowledged that he tested the limits of how much information the government required him to collect from his customersYou trust us we trust you is how he described his companys philosophy at the conference last year A lot of regulators frowned on that with me But we said Its going to work and it has worked so farA few months after that event BitInstants bank shut down the companys account suddenly The company went offline soon after that and faced a lawsuit from customers who said the company had misrepresented its services and sought classaction statusBut that had not put a crimp in his big plans Last month his goal was to reopen BitInstant in the first quarter of this year after more fundraising After the arrest he is not supposed to deal in Bitcoin but his big ambitions for the currency and himself have not fadedGiven the opportunity I will get back on the speaking circuit and be an evangelizer for Bitcoin he said on Thursday At the same time the more highprofile you are the more careful you have to be Its scary,2014-02-06T18:01:21Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/us/borders-new-sentinels-are-robots-penetrating-deepest-drug-routes.html,NOGALES Ariz   Tom Pittman has made a career as a Border Patrol agent here guarding this citys underground drainage system where the tunnels that carry sewage and storm runoff between the United States and Mexico are also busy drugsmuggling routes Over the years he has crawled and slithered past putrid puddles makeshift latrines and discarded needles left behind by drug users relying on instincts mostly to gauge the risks aheadIt is a dirty and dangerous business but these days there is a robot for thatThree robots out of four in use by the agency along the entire southern border are newly assigned to the Border Patrol station here The reason is in the numbers Most of the tunnels discovered along the border lead from Nogales Mexico to Nogales Ariz out of sight of the agents cameras and drones that blanket the ground above This month federal agents closed the largest one found so far a 481foot passageway aired by fans and lit by lamps hanging from wires that ran along the tunnels wallsThe robots are just the latest tactic in a vexing battle by the federal authorities to try to stem the flow of drugs through the tunnels considered prime pieces of real estate by the smuggling groups that build and control them Border Patrol agents have tried dumping concrete inside the tunnels to render them unusable and installing cameras and motion detectors to alert them of suspicious movement underground But still the tunnel diggers persistThe robots valued for their speed and maneuverability can serve as the first eyes on places considered too risky for humans to exploreIf anyone is going to get hurt it better be that robot said Mr Pittman a supervisory agent hereAlong the southern border drug smuggling has remained stubbornly prolific with seizures happening not just in the tunnels but also at legal ports of entry and among illegal border crossers carrying bales of marijuana in their backpacks Some 29 million pounds of drugs mostly marijuana were seized by Customs and Border Protection agents in the past fiscal year 13 million of those pounds were seized in Arizona the largest amount among the four states that border Mexico according to agency statistics Of the 45 crossborder tunnels found in the Southwest in the past three fiscal years 25 were in Nogales  not counting the partly finished tunnels the agents found  and three more have been uncovered this yearThe tunnels are part of a sophisticated enterprise The groups that control the smuggling routes in the Mexican Nogales  the Sinaloa cartel on the east side of the city the BeltrnLeyva cartel on the west  have an understanding One side pays the other to use the areas it holds both above ground and underground said Special Agent Alex Garcia of Homeland Security Investigations who leads the border tunnel task force hereA senior American law enforcement official said Saturday that the leader of the Sinaloa cartel Joaqun Guzmn Loera the worlds mostwanted drug lord had been capturedMany of the tunnel diggers are believed to come from the copper mines of Cananea Mexico about 45 miles southeast of Nogales They use tools with short handles because in the tunnels here there is no room to stand up straight Mr Garcia saidThat does not bother the tunneldetecting robots They have cameras that look up down and sideways in front of them and behind them Controlled remotely by joysticks they glide bump and scrape along dark cramped areas where the air is not safe for humans to breathe for long One model sounds and looks like the remotecontrolled Humvees sold in toy stores The other with its bulletshaped body and shiny blue and silver shell seems as if it had been pulled right off a scifi movie setAmong the daily duties shared by Mr Pittman and a small group of agents certified to search confined spaces is to comb through Nogaless drainage lines which the smugglers often tap into to push their loads north The agents look for signs of disturbance like a patch of plastic on a steel pipe or scarring where the metal should be smoothTo get ready for this work the human agents have to put on kneepads elbow pads  weve got to put on helmets gloves said Kevin Hecht the deputy patrol agent in charge of the Border Patrol station in Nogales and one of the agencys foremost experts on illicit tunnels Sometimes we have to put on Tyvek suits he said referring to the coveralls that protect against the hazards that can lurk below drainage linesThe robots on the other hand need no preparation other than the flick of a switchThey scour the tunnels much faster than the agents can and in the complicated work of securing the border underground to waste time is to risk losing ground to the smugglers Eric S Balliet assistant special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Nogales said the agents in the tunnel task force had closed on average one tunnel a month in Nogales since October 2010 The Border Patrol and its parent agency Customs and Border Protection and the Drug Enforcement Administration are also part of the task forceAt any given moment theres a tunnel being planned under construction or in operation in and around this city Mr Balliet saidThe large tunnel found here this month linked an abandoned home in Mexico to an occupied house not far from the border The drugs were taken from there in hollowedout couches or inside washing machines according to the criminal complaint three men were arrested on drugconspiracy chargesMany of the tunnels that are found end in inconspicuous places like this One of them discovered in December exited into a backyard shed Another found last February ended at an embankment behind the border fence near a spot where a different tunnel had been closed in March 2012Nogales Ariz recently banned parking on a section of International Street which runs parallel to the fence after a tunnel exit was found there less than 100 feet from a border crossing Smugglers inside the tunnel had used a jackhammer to raise a piece of concrete cut from the pavement Then they pushed bales of marijuana through the fake bottom of a refrigerated truck parked right above the holeTask force agents sometimes observe a tunnel for months before moving in A whiteboard in the bunker from which they operate in Rio Rico a town just north of Nogales listed the nine open investigations they have had since January 2013 An inquiry might start with a tip from a disaffected tunnel digger or a breach found by one of the robots along the drainage lines in the United StatesAt the end of the day Mr Balliet said theres an organizational structure behind these tunnels and thats what were after The end

Uruguay have prompted or accelerated discussion about changing pot laws in many nations and activists say momentum is building in advance of a special United Nations convention on drugs scheduled for 2016 Heres a look at how some countries are rethinking their approach to marijuana___ARGENTINAPersonal possession of controlled substances has been decriminalized thanks to a Supreme Court ruling in 2009 that found imposing jail time for small amounts of drugs was a violation of Argentinas constitution which protects private actions that dont harm others Lawmakers have been working to amend the law since then with proposals ranging from simple decriminalization in accordance with the ruling to a complete overhaul of the countrys drug laws In December Father Juan Carlos Molina a Catholic priest newly appointed as the nations drug czar said Argentina deserves a debate about whether to follow Uruguay in regulating marijuana___BRAZILBrazil doesnt punish personal drug use but trafficking or transporting small amounts of controlled substances is a criminal offense punishable by drug abuse education or community service Some advocates worry the law isnt clear about how much constitutes personal possession and that can leave it up to a judges discretion about whether someone should be punished In November former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso joined former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in calling for the decriminalization of all drugs and allowing countries to experiment with drug regulation___GUATEMALAPresident Otto Perez Molina of Guatemala a hardhit cocaine transit country took the floor at the UN last fall to join a growing chorus of nations calling the drug war a failed strategy He announced that his country would study different approaches and praised the visionary experiments in Washington and Colorado  as well as US President Barack Obamas decision to let them go forward Currently prison terms of four months to two years can be imposed for the possession of drugs for personal use___JAMAICAThe island nation is a primary source of marijuana in the Caribbean Possession remains illegal and can result in mandated treatment or rehabilitation though usually the defendant pays a small fine and is not incarcerated Nevertheless many young men wind up with criminal records that affect their future employment options and recent changes in the US and Uruguay have given momentum to activists who hope to see marijuana decriminalization approved soon___MEXICOIn Mexico where tens of thousands have been killed in drug war violence in the past seven years there is no general push to legalize or regulate marijuana for recreational use But in more liberal Mexico City a metropolis of 8 million lawmakers have introduced a measure to allow stores to sell up to 5 grams of pot The plan has the mayors support but could set up a fight with the federal government Small amounts of marijuana and other drugs have been decriminalized in Mexico since 2009___MOROCCOMorocco is one of the worlds leading hashish producers and nearly all of it makes its way into Europe Cannabis was legal to grow as late as the 1950s by order of the king Two leading political parties want to relegalize its cultivation for medical and industrial uses with the goal of helping small farmers who survive on the crop but live at the mercy of drug lords and police attempts to eradicate it There is little chance the conservative nation will legalize it for recreational use any time soon___NETHERLANDSThe Netherlands has long had some of the most liberal cannabis laws Hoping to keep pot users away from dealers of harder drugs the country in the late 1970s began allowing coffee shops to sell marijuana which remains technically illegal Since 2012 the federal government has clamped down briefly requiring people to obtain a weed pass to buy cannabis and banning sales to tourists Some cities including Amsterdam have declined to ban sales to tourists however and mayors of 35 cities have banded together to call for the legalization of marijuana growing___UNITED STATESLong the drug war crusader the US was the driving force behind the 1961 treaty that formed the basis of international narcotics control For decades the US has required other nations to cooperate in the drug war or risk losing foreign aid even as some Latin American countries ravaged by drug war violence criticized America for failing to curb its appetite for cocaine marijuana and other substances Since 1996 nearly half the states have allowed medical use of marijuana despite federal laws banning it and some states are considering following the lead of Washington state and Colorado in legalizing recreational use___URUGUAYIn December Uruguay became the first nation to approve marijuana legalization and regulation President Jose Mujica said his goal is to drive drug traffickers out of the dope business and reduce consumption by creating a safe legal and transparent environment in which the state closely monitors every aspect of marijuana use By April Uruguay is expected to have written the fine print on its regulations Once registered and licensed

up for reelection in NovemberDemocrats believe it could energize their base in a midterm electoral season that generally results in low turn out while polls show even a majority of Florida Republicans support medical marijuana useScott opposes the ballot initiative and is trailing in polls to his main challenger former governor Charlie Crist who favors legalization That could set the stage for a political battle in a state that is both a harsh enforcer of drug laws and a major pot producerFloridas contest is the only gubernatorial election in a big swing state in Novembers midterm elections and a Democratic victory would be a major blow to the Republican party heading into the 2016 presidential raceScott tried to block the ballot arguing the wording was too vague and could allow almost anyone to get their hands on the drug but the state Supreme Court approved it nonethelessAs many as 70 percent of registered Republicans in Florida favored medical marijuana in a November Quinnipiac University poll Support was even higher among Democrats at 87 percent and independents at 88 percentRepublican political consultant Rick Wilson said the party should get out in front of a rapidly

syndrome a rare genetic disorder that causes dozens of seizures daily and must currently take a cocktail of drugs with harmful sideeffectsHsiao and her husband who are Republicans are considering moving to Colorado where Charlottes Web is legal and might also switch their vote if the law is not changedIf they refuse it is because of a willful disregard for the weakest of their constituents And I would not want someone like that in public office said HsiaoOpponents argue that medical marijuana will not be dispensed in a controlled settingThe groups  who have pushed for marijuana to be legalized have painted the perception that marijuana is a harmless drug by saying its safer than alcohol said Calvina Fay director of the Drug Free America FoundationColorado which this month became the first state with legalized recreational marijuana is one of 20 states across the country that allow medical marijuana New York Washington DC Alaska and Alabama are also grappling with the issueTurnout among millennials goes down in midterm elections said Susan MacManus a political scientist at the University of South Florida But medical marijuana is seen by some political strategists as a very mobilizing issue to bring out young voters she addedFlorida has not elected a Democrat as governor since 1994 while Republicans have also cemented their control over both legislative housesScott could choose to leave it to voters as a matter of personal choice rather than risk going up against marijuana ads featuring war veterans suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or

almost unanimously this month to oppose medical marijuana saying it would lead to more crime and traffic accidentsPolk County Sheriff Grady Judd who heads the association described the initiative as a fraudulent effort to fully legalize marijuanaIn 2012 law enforcement uncovered 540 marijuana grow houses in Florida more than any other state in the country While medical marijuana legalization will not stop the states black market some law enforcement experts argue it could help reduce the violent crime associated with illegal drugs and reduce the prison populationIn 2010 Florida ranked third in

NYT,http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/bitcoin-heist-highlights-elusive-paths-of-regulation/,Related LinksBritain Drops Plan to Tax Trading of BitcoinsCan nearly 450 million go missing without a crime taking place That is only one of the questions stemming from the collapse of the Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox that present a host of challenges for governments worldwide that are struggling to regulate virtual currenciesMt Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan after the disappearance of more than 744000 Bitcoins owned by customers along with 100000 of its own Unlike an ordinary robbery this appears to be the work of hackers who exploited a weakness in the system for tracking Bitcoin transactions that allowed the currency to be diverted perhaps over a few of yearsThe number taken amounts to about 6 percent of the total Bitcoins in circulation raising serious questions about how any virtual currency can be made safe for consumers and investors For law enforcement this is like any bank robbery that requires identifying the perpetrators DealBook reported that the Justice Department had issued subpoenas to Mt Gox and other firms to gather information about how virtual currencies are transferred and converted into dollarsBut unlike in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid none of the Mt Gox thieves are looking back at the posse and asking Who are those guys One of the appeals of Bitcoin is its anonymity and trying to find those who stole something intended to be untraceable through computer hacking may well be impossible So the losses from Mt Gox are unlikely to be recovered The question becomes how governments will monitor transactions in virtual currencies to protect owners Doing so may be even more difficult when one of the motivations for developing Bitcoin was to avoid any official involvementSenator Joe Manchin III offered one approach in a letter sent last week to financial regulators urging them to work together act quickly and prohibit this dangerous currency from harming hardworking Americans This is the same strategy taken by China which prohibited its banks from trading in virtual currenciesUnfortunately it is easier to call for a ban on virtual currencies than actually instituting one Janet L Yellen the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve responded to a question from Senator Manchin at a recent hearing that her agency simply does not have authority to supervise or regulate Bitcoin in any way So if there is going to be a push to restrict or even ban the use of virtual currencies it will have to come from CongressThe history of laws created to impose onerous restrictions on popular goods is not positive Prohibition failed in the 1920s while the criminalization of marijuana and online gambling has started to crumble so there is not much hope for blocking the use of virtual currenciesThose who lost Bitcoins held by Mt Gox have turned to the courts but the likelihood of securing a recovery looks small A classaction lawsuit was filed in the Federal District Court in Chicago against the exchange claiming a number of violations of Illinois law including consumer protection and fraud The problem is that Mt Gox does not appear to have any assets so individuals are unlikely to have any legal recourse for their losses On the flip side the approach taken by supporters of Bitcoin to the collapse of Mt Gox reflects Friedrich Nietzsches famous comment That which does not kill us makes us stronger Barry Silbert the chief executive of SecondMarket plans to start a Bitcoin exchange that will be modeled after the New York Stock Exchange that can provide more reassurance to consumersThat approach may signal how governments will go about regulating virtual currencies by adapting the structure used for trading securities and commodities The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission already have in place extensive rules for how exchanges and dealers operate and perhaps more important recordkeeping and capital requirements for those who will hold the property of othersAnother possible avenue for regulation would be to fit virtual currency firms into the rules for trading regular currencies The CFTC used authority provided by the DoddFrank Act to create a  regulated entity called a retail foreign exchange dealer which is allowed to engage in retail transactions and could be expanded to cover Bitcoin tradingThe recordkeeping requirements for securities and commodities exchanges would be of great help to the law enforcement authorities which rely on a paper trail to build cases involving theft embezzlement and misappropriation The demise of Mt Gox shows how difficult it is to find something that exists only in cyberspace when there are inadequate records about who actually owned the propertyTo protect customers from a total loss the government can also require an insurance program along the lines provided for bank and brokerage customers Firms that hold virtual currency on behalf of customers could be required to pay into a fund to be used to reimburse at least part of the loss if another situation like the theft at Mt Gox were to happenNeedless to say advocates of Bitcoin who cherish its anonymity and freedom from governmental oversight will not take kindly to increased regulation along with the costs that come with it Losing 450 million with no realistic chance of finding the thieves will inevitably spur changes in the structure of the market for virtual currency Mt Gox will not kill Bitcoin but it is pushing governments to take a more active role in overseeing how it is traded,2014-03-03T12:02:01Z,drugs

and mixed with olive oil so patients can consume them So Ill fight for whomever wants thisDoctors warn there is no proof that Charlottes Web is effective or even safeIn the frenzy to find the drug there have been reports of nonauthorized suppliers offering bogus strains of Charlottes Web In one case a doctor said parents were told they could replicate the strain by cooking marijuana in butter Their child went into heavy seizuresWe dont have any peerreviewed published literature to support it Dr Larry Wolk the state health departments chief medical officer said of Charlottes WebStill more than 100 families have relocated since Charlottes story first began spreading last summer according to Figi and her husband The relocated families have formed a closeknit group in Colorado Springs the

pediatric epilepsy centers rather than move to ColoradoHowever the society urges more study of pots possibilities The families using Charlottes Web as well as the brothers who grow it say they want the drug rigorously tested and their efforts to ensure its purity have won them praise from skeptics like WolkFor many Charlottes story was something they couldnt ignoreCharlotte is a twin but her sister Chase doesnt have Dravets syndrome which kills kids before they reach adulthoodIn early 2012 it seemed Charlotte would be added to that grim roster Her vital signs flatlined three times leading her parents to begin preparing for her death They even signed an order for doctors not to take heroic measures to save her life again should she go into cardiac arrestHer father Matt a former Green

lab to test its purityCharlotte takes the medication twice a day A year ago she could only say one word her father said Now she says complete sentencesThe recovery of Charlotte and other kids has

hobble the US energy industry Whiting Petroleum Corp is busy figuring out where in the state it can spend 10 billion over the next decadeWhiting has little concern the ballot initiative will succeed even after votes in several of the states cities last fall to ban fracking the controversial use of highpressure water mixed with chemicals and sand to extract oil and natural gas At least one

the end said Tisha Conoly Schuller president of the Colorado Oil  Gas Association an industry trade group that is challenging local fracking bans Thats why you dont see energy companies changing their investment strategy in ColoradoBallot proponents have until August to submit roughly 86100 signatures to the secretary of state The proposal known as the Community Rights Amendment would change the Colorado constitution to let each county city town or other municipal subdivision enact laws that protect health safety and welfare for residents  essentially allowing them to regulate fracking mining and even marijuana useThe industry says this scenario would be a regulatory nightmare for companies and threaten the more than 16 billion the state receives each year in oil and natural gas taxes a third of which helps fund the states education budgetOrganizers say they want to strip power from state officials and return rights to local governments The proposal is not directly written to curb oil or natural gas development said Clifton Willmeng a member of the Colorado Community Rights Network the main ballot sponsorThe essence of this ballot is to give communities power over corporations Willmeng said Yes it could be used to ban fracking but it could also be used to limit genetic engineering or waste disposal sitesStill oil and natural gas producers believe the ballot measure could only have been written to apply to them And Willmeng acknowledged that had the ballot measure been approved before last fall the towns that passed fracking bans wouldnt now be facing legal

white gold and rust big and little antidepressants antiemetics and tranquilizers  given to her by doctors So it always seemed hypocritical to her that while she could possess such powerful mindaltering pharmaceuticals in fairly generous quantities she was not allowed to legally smoke marijuana to relieve the nausea and pain of her cancer and chemotherapyNow her wish may be a step closer to reality as Gov Andrew M Cuomo of New York plans to announce in the State of the State address on Wednesday that he will use his executive powers to allow 20 hospitals across the state to dispense medical marijuana state officials saidThe plan bypasses the State Legislature which has failed to pass a medical marijuana bill but it leaves much to be determined such as which patients would qualify and which hospitals would be chosen as dispensariesMs Rivera 60 who is in remission from breast colon and throat cancers and other patients and their families said on Sunday that they worried the program would be too restrictive I think its kind of more than anything for terminally ill patients and thats wonderful Ms Rivera said But then theres people like me Are we dying right now No But we could certainly use the healing propertiesThe plan would invoke a 1980 law allowing research into marijuana therapy for patients who are involved in a lifethreatening or sensethreatening situation and it specifically mentions cancer and glaucomaThe governors aides have said that he does not want marijuana to be available for runofthemill complaints like backache as it is in some other states But an administration official said on Sunday that the 1980 law did not limit treatment to terminal cases and that conditions like multiple sclerosis severe pediatric illness and cancer in remission would probably qualify The final regulations are up to the Health Department after public hearingsThe official who spoke anonymously because the program has yet to be announced said the law was being interpreted as a research program not into the efficacy of the drug itself but into the best way of creating a system to dispense it Hospitals would have to apply to the State Health Department to become dispensaries It was not clear Sunday whether academic medical centers for instance would have an advantage over community hospitals The administration official said that apart from geographical diversity the criteria for being selected had not yet been developedOfficials at several major New York hospitals and the Greater New York Hospital Association a trade group said they had not been consultedGabriel Sayegh state director of Drug Policy Alliance an advocacy group said the governors plan was an excellent development but he was anxious to see the regulations Its not clear its going to be viable for many of the patients we have in the state Mr Sayegh saidAssemblyman Richard Gottfried a Manhattan Democrat said he was pleased that Governor Cuomo had recognized the legitimacy of medical marijuana But he said that he considered the governors plan an interim measure and that he would continue to push his own bill in the Legislature because it was more comprehensiveScott Reif a

would like to try marijuana for her son Oliver 14 who has frequent seizures as a result of a brain injury Ms Miller who lives in Atlantic Beach in Nassau County said that out of desperation she had agreed to put her son on medication that has potentially lifethreatening side effectsShe wants to try a strain of marijuana grown in Colorado that is said to be particularly effective against pediatric seizures Her son who has a feeding tube could not smoke it but would take it in some other formShe said she was eager to find out whether the program would apply to children and whether it would provide the specific type of marijuana that Oliver needsAs a parent I have poured poison into my son thats FDA approved Ms Miller said Thats what Ive been doing for 14 years and nothing has helped Heres the promise of a medication thats stopping these seizures Its working and there are no side effects,2014-01-06T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/books/review/call-me-burroughs-by-barry-miles.html,William S Burroughs didnt say anything for shock value his student Sam Kashner once observed His life had shock valueBorn to a prominent St Louis family in 1914 Burroughs linked his lineage at every point to the fatal plotlines of American hubris and power His mothers family had been slave owners in the antebellum South his paternal grandfather invented the adding machine a building block in the embryonic militaryindustrialmedia complex His uncle Ivy Lee a pioneer of public relations counted Hitlers regime among his preferred clients Burroughs himself spent time in Vienna in the 1930s and learned a lesson he never forgot Everything Hitler did was legal Laws could spur not deter the blackest of crimes To top it off young Bill had also attended the Los Alamos Ranch School in New Mexico which in 1943 would be coopted for the Manhattan Project The sick soul sick unto death of the atomic age became his great subjectBurroughs graduated from Harvard in 1936 and never again did anything that was expected of him Thanks to the allowance his parents provided until he was 50 his shortterm jobs notably as a detective and an exterminator doubled as research into his real occupations gay sex hard drugs and avantgarde writingIn Call Me Burroughs his authoritative new biography Barry Miles avoids unduly romanticizing Burroughss outlaw status Even Burroughs the proud progenitor of what some called gay pornography was not immune to the homophobia he defied as late as 1957 he referred to homosexuality as a horrible sickness though he had no serious wish for a cure Nor wisely does Miles minimize the depth and tenacity of Burroughss addictions He wrote all of his books under the influence of drugs  principally heroin alcohol marijuana and methadone Miless book is emphatically not however the familiar story of a gifted writers substancesoaked decline probably for the simple reason that Burroughss genius for surreal black comedy tempered with hard practical thought never deserted him Though he chronicled all its horrors and tried various treatment programs Burroughs in some real sense chose addiction it was his entree to the street slang and chronic desperation of the noir lifers who occupied his fiction from Junkie 1953 on When he died at 83 in 1997 his friends reportedly tucked some heroin and marijuana along with his 38 into his coffinHailed after the publication of Naked Lunch in 1959 as an avatar of postmodernism Burroughs publicly matched wits with Michel Foucault and Jean Genet dourly graced the cover of Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band and managed his reputation as the cryptic godfather of punk The best way to get to the top in America he freely acknowledged is to be born there If few of his honors were sought none were refused Keep your snout in the public trough was a Burroughs maxim Its a pranksters planet and Burroughs was in on the jokeMiles also charts in detail how dependent this singular iconoclast was on the inspiration and editorial skills of his friends Without Allen Ginsberg who spent 10 weeks establishing some kind of order on the pages of Naked Lunch scattered around the floor of Burroughss room in Tangier without the painter Brion Gysin who originated the cutup method and without James Grauerholz Burroughss beloved companion editor and literary executor we wouldnt have any of his major works in their present form Though the first and last drafts were always his collaboration rescued Burroughs from the terrors and falsities of single authorship giving him access to kindred minds with different resources He knew they made his work as Ginsberg put it more decipherableAppropriately this biography as Miles is at pains to tell us is itself a collaboration resting on the monumental research Grauerholz did for a biography he abandoned in 2010 and the extensive taped interviews Ted Morgan conducted for Literary Outlaw his pioneering 1988 biography Miles himself knew Burroughs for many years it was he who discovered the lost manuscripts of Queer 1985 and Interzone 1989 and he has written a number of books on the Beat Generation including a fine biography of Ginsberg and an early study of Burroughs Although he occasionally simplifies Burroughss story by superficial moralizing  endorsing at one point a psychiatrists diagnosis of Burroughs in 1949 as a grossly immature mamas boy terms then virtually synonymous as Miles surely knows with homosexual  his access and wealth of detail will make this the goto biography for many years to comeIn the most terrible and formative event of his adult life on Sept 6 1951 Burroughs a keen marksman shot and killed his commonlaw wife Joan in a drunken game of William Tell Burroughs never deceived Joan she knew he preferred the real uncut boy stuff but her patience seemed unhappily infinite in her word and his devotion was real and lifelong Burroughs served only two weeks in jail their son Billy then 4 was raised by Burroughss parents Billy drank himself to death in 1981 at 33 Miles like Billy himself puts the blame squarely on Burroughs By killing the boys mother he had destroyed Billys life Delicate funny and uncannily intelligent Joan was also an alcoholic and drug addict who left Billy and Julie her daughter by an earlier relationship unbathed and without underwear or shoes she toilettrained them with the same Revere Ware she used for cooking She was no more a fit parent than Burroughs The crime if there was one in this tragedy was Burroughss veto of the abortion option Ginsberg thought Joan used Bill to commit suicide an opinion Burroughs never shared All his intimate relationships had been strained and offkey he told Ted Morgan his affection denied when neededMiles rightly finds Burroughss enduring literary significance in his highwire reinvention of the picaresque Abandoning the narrative connections by which the traditional novel grants its protagonist a coherence denied by life he fashioned an art of paranoia and parody half highmodernist irony half scifi cartoon at once fantastic and literal The cutup method he adopted in the 1960s  taking scissors to chosen texts and juxtaposing the fragments into new sequences  was part of his decoding operation Magic must counter magic to reroute power At a literary conference in 1962 Burroughs told the audience he had once caused a plane crash by willing it Are you serious another writer asked incredulously Perfectly Burroughs answered with characteristic sangfroid He never doubted that the sources of information on which his opponents relied were far more suspect than his own You are not paid off to be quiet about what you know he said You are paid not to find it outThough many of his fans were young Burroughs was 45 when Naked Lunch was published he finished his great trilogy Cities of the Red Night 1981 The Place of Dead Roads 1984 and The Western Lands 1987 at 73 and he brought old age impeccably tailored with him into the spotlight The most chic old man of letters since Tiresias roamed the Wasteland Burroughss Wise Man persona mocked and countered the reputed wise men in Washington steering the country on what he considered its suicidal and psychotic course For all its futurist lan Burroughss work constitutes an extended elegy for a time before bureaucracy strangled the frontier before rivers became poisoned sewers before Melancholy Baby died from an overdose of time In 1981 he moved back to the Midwest to be near Grauerholz and discovered that Kansas unlike Byzantium was a country for old men Sky in all directions he noted in 1995 a fit home for a cosmonaut of terrestrial and extraterrestrial

Mexican military had captured one of Guzmans top couriers who promptly provided details of the stash houses Guzman and his associates had been using the officials saidAt each house the Mexican military found the same thing steel reinforced doors and an escape hatch below the bathtubs Each hatch led to a series of interconnected tunnels in the citys drainage systemThe officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss how Guzman was located said troops who raided Guzmans main house in Culiacan chased him through the drainage pipes before losing him in the maze under the cityA day later on Feb 18 Guzman aide Manuel Lopez Ozorio was arrested and told investigators that he had picked up Guzman cartel communications chief Carlos Manuel Ramirez and a woman from a drainage pipe and helped them flee to MazatlanWhen he was finally in handcuffs the man who eluded Mexican authorities for more than a decade looked pudgy bowed and

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/nyregion/addicted-to-drugs-on-staten-island.html,Late last month Corey Epstein a peripheral cast member on the reality television series Jerseylicious was arrested along with 20 others in a drug sweep on Staten Island that grew out of a 16month investigation called Operation Silent Hill Mr Epstein was charged with selling three oxycodone pills to an undercover officer in front of his house on Nehring Avenue in New Springville an area that had been largely rural until the 1970s when malls and what has since become the vernacular architectural style of Staten Island  the deepbacked twofamily split level with a high occasionally baroque stoop  imbued it and so much of Staten Island with a sense of inanimate prosperityAcross the country one of the most significant social shifts of the 21st century has been the migration of drug use from centers of urban poverty to places that are suburban white and middle or marginally middleclass In New York in recent years these changes have made Staten Island a particular nexus of affliction Its death rate from heroin overdose and from the broader category of opioids including oxycodone and other painkillers is the highest of any borough in the city From 2005 to 2011 according to city health statistics as fatalities from overdosing on drugs decreased citywide the death rate from opioid overdose on Staten Island nearly quadrupled leaving it more than three times that of the BronxWhat these new patterns of drug usage so readily remind us is that it is not marijuana that ought to be feared as a pathway to more insidious forms of addiction it is those substances that remain perfectly legal Jacqueline Fiore the executive director of the Staten Island YMCA Counseling Service a highly respected drug treatment facility said she and her colleagues in the recovery world had anticipated and worried about a heroin problem for several years because of the soaring rates of painkiller addiction they were seeing Prescription painkillers had been notoriously easy to get on Staten Island until a state initiative implemented more rigorous monitoring two years agoEnforcement drove up the blackmarket price of pills like OxyContin to about 25 each on Staten Island at a time when the cost of heroin was coming down In 2010 6 percent of patients going to the YMCA Service  which has one branch on Staten Islands North Shore and another on the comparatively affluent South Shore  entered the program addicted to heroin Last year that figure rose to 20 percentOne morning last week at the South Shore facility in Eltingville I met two of these patients one of them a 27yearold woman Rebecca Ann Wolfson who has been sober for 11 months after more than 15 unsuccessful attempts at rehabilitation Ms Wolfson grew up in Bay Ridge Brooklyn with a mother who was an OxyContin addict until Ms Wolfson was 10 As a child she would accompany her mother on drug runs she told me Later as a young teenager Ms Wolfson developed a drinking problem so severe that she wound up in the hospital with pancreatitis Eventually she had her gall bladder removed After her surgery she was given a prescription for Percocet From there she fell easily into heroin use and a boyfriend became addicted as well she told meAnother patient a Staten Island native also in his 20s recounted how he had begun drinking and taking painkillers while at Tottenville High School students standing out in front today will tell you that you can connect just up the block This patient whose father works for the citys Sanitation Department joined the Navy after high school and a stint in rehab He managed to stay free of pills for four years until an injury sustained during a deployment to Afghanistan took him back to his old ritualsBack home on Staten Island he had a prescription for Dilaudid He would sell the pills and go buy heroin in Newark where it was even cheaper He has been sober for five months now and is disillusioned by how much the drug culture on Staten Island has stayed the same since he was in high school Its rare that people change here he told me noting that he had run into his old drug dealer just the other day and saw no hint that the man had found a new occupationTwelvestep philosophy typically diminishes the significance of sociocultural factors in addiction democratizing the disease and stressing the universal components of pain and emptiness that feed it But the problems that have arisen on Staten Island would also seem to suggest a story about the stagnancy and the ailing fortunes of the working and middle classes The high tally of bluecollar workers on Staten Island means a greater propensity for workrelated injuries Ms Fiore pointed out and in turn a greater degree of exposure to painkillers to begin withAlthough Staten Island with a population that is threequarters white maintains the highest homeownership rate in the city  with a median household income significantly above the citys taken as a whole  both its unemployment and poverty rates went up from 2000 to 2011 In the Tottenville area where the median household income is more than 80000 the unemployment rate nearly doubled over that period In the Stapleton and St George neighborhoods which are less affluent but have incomes still solidly in the middle the poverty rate went from under 16 percent in 2000 to over 21 percent a decade laterAcross the city in fact over the past 10 years or so the poverty rates declined in a number of traditionally poor neighborhoods like Brownsville in Brooklyn and Morrisania in the Bronx even as they escalated in middleclass neighborhoods like Bayside in Queens and the Coop City area of the Bronx This too is an illness and perhaps we are now beginning to see some of the symptoms,2014-02-16T00:00:00Z,drugs

should ask patients about gun ownership and discuss gun safety procedures his belief that more federal funding should be allocated for gun violence research and his support for universal background checks and an assault weapons banDr Murthys record of political activism in support of radical gun control measures raises significant concerns about his ability to objectively examine issues

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/15/nyregion/even-supporters-question-cuomos-marijuana-plan.html,ALBANY   When Gov Andrew M Cuomo announced this month that he would allow medical marijuana in New York the news was greeted with great enthusiasm by those who champion the drug for patients with cancer AIDS and other serious illnessesBut the initial euphoria has abated as those same supporters have questioned Mr Cuomos plan with few answers so farThe administration has yet to detail the 20 hospitals statewide where medical marijuana would be available in what forms it would be dispensed or  perhaps most critically  where the state would get its supply Nor has the governor made clear what the plan would cost or who would pay for itAnd while advocates say they appreciate the governors support they are using the uncertainty about his proposal which hinges on an obscure neverimplemented 1980 law to push for new legislation that would include specifics like how patients physicians and producers of marijuana would be chosenThe proposal that the governor has put forth is not the solution that patients need in this state said Gabriel Sayegh the state director for the Drug Policy Alliance which lobbies for more liberal drug laws Its great if they want to move something forward that gets the ball rolling  cool do it  but that for us is not the same thing as a comprehensive systemThe governors office says its proposal will work and offered a few more specifics on Tuesday The administration intends to ask federal authorities for permission to run a study of an investigational new drug officials said and aides to Mr Cuomo have spoken in recent days to federal officials about their plans One option state officials say would be to get marijuana from the federal government which grows marijuana for research purposes on a farm managed by the University of MississippiBut advocates say that the 12acre farms yearly production capacity of perhaps a few thousand kilograms may not be adequate to serve the tens of thousands of New Yorkers who could be eligible for medical marijuana Under the governors plan federal health officials would have to review New Yorks drug study before the state could ask the federal government to provide it with marijuanaAdvocates for medical marijuana would prefer a system where independent marijuana producers would be licensed and would dispense it not by prescription but on a health professionals recommendation as is done in some other statesMr Cuomos plan to have hospitals prescribe the drug experts in marijuana law say is also complicated by the fact that the federal government still views it as illegal putting it on a similar legal plane as heroin and cocaineBrian Vincente a lawyer in Denver who was an author of Colorados landmark law permitting recreational use of marijuana said the federal prohibition meant that hospitals could be wary of participatingAny facility that relies on federal money or grants is very reticent to dispense or possess marijuana he saidObtaining permission to study marijuana can also be difficult and very timeconsuming Mr Vincente added It takes decades he said And the federal government almost always says noBut New York State officials disputed that they said on Tuesday that they were confident of success and that hospitals performing federally approved research into medical marijuana would not see other federal money jeopardizedCriticism of the governors proposal is premature said Matt Wing a spokesman for the governor Past efforts to get legislation passed havent been successful and we are taking action now to implement a medical marijuana program that helps patients in need while limiting the potential for abuseTwo major hospital associations in New York said their members supported the idea of medical marijuana but were awaiting detailsSeveral hospitals have expressed interest in exploring the option of providing medical marijuana to their patients said Brian Conway a spokesman for the Greater New York Hospital Association but recognize that a number of issues need to be addressedThe questions around the plan have given new impetus to state lawmakers sponsoring another piece of medicalmarijuana legislation the Compassionate Care Act which died last year in the Senate where Republicans share powerSenator Diane J Savino a Staten Island Democrat who is a sponsor of the Compassionate Care Act expressed concern that Mr Cuomos proposal might now lead some lawmakers to see medical marijuana as a settled question In some respects it kind of took the wind out of the sails on the Senate side she said because their attitude is Why do we need legislation The governor said we are going to do thisStill supporters of medical marijuana praised the governor for taking a stand in favor of it even if it was not entirely clear how his plan would become realityWe know you can do it Mr Sayegh said Other states have done it We can do it And we can probably do it better,2014-01-15T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/02/25/world/americas/ap-lt-drug-war-mexico-cartel-future.html,MEXICO CITY   The powerful Sinaloa cartel is expected to go right on selling billions of dollars of illegal drugs despite the takedown of its legendary leader Joaquin El Chapo Guzman who leaves in place a sophisticated distribution network and business planGuzmans capture Saturday was undoubtedly a major blow for a criminal ring likened to a Fortune 500 company  the loss of its chief executive coming on the heels of more than a dozen arrests of key lieutenants and lowerlevel operators in recent months Yet the cartel remains the major supplier of cocaine to the US and the arrest did not touch the cartels immense political power nurtured through the bribery of officials or its thriving money laundering operationsAs long as these other structures remain in place all things being equal Sinaloa will be able to continue to operate if not as normal at least as the most powerful criminal organization in Mexico said David Shirk director of the University of San Diegos Justice in Mexico ProjectThe longerterm fate of the cartel is more difficult to predict however as authorities pursue other top leaders and weaker rivals dream of moving inMexicos Secretary of the Interior Miguel Angel Osorio Chong said so far theres only speculation about how the cartel will replace Guzman and whether other criminal groups will try to take overWe have to wait for real information and when we have it we will act Osorio Chong said in an interview with The Associated Press That will be part of our work to see how they reorganize how they accommodate  so we can keep them from resurging and replantingOn Monday a senior Drug Enforcement Administration official told The Associated Press that intelligence indicates Guzmans partner Ismael El Mayo Zambada is likely to be the next chief of the Sinaloa cartel The official agreed to discuss specific details of the arrest only if not quoted by nameGuzman who made Forbes magazines lists of billionaires and most powerful people was first among equals with Zambada and Juan Jose Esparragoza known as El Azul both of whom remain at largeThe pair shared a clear vision not only with respect to their adversaries but also with their business plan for trafficking cocaine marijuana heroin and methamphetamine in some 54 countries said Guillermo Valdes former head of Mexicos top domestic intelligence agencyIn other recent takedowns of major cartels the Mexican government had to hit more than one leader before an organization was dismantled or scattered into smaller gangs One by one the Arellano Felix brothers in Tijuana were arrested or killed over the last decade as were the Beltran Leyva brothers from 2008 to 2011 Though the Mexican marines killed Zeta leader Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano in October 2012 the power of that brutal gang did not diminish until the other leader Miguel Angel Trevino Morales was arrested last summerSome predict Sinaloa is about to suffer the same fateUS Rep Michael McCaul who is chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security said to expect more arrests because authorities penetrated the cartels communications system in catching GuzmanOur ability to crack their code will not bode well for their future he said comparing Guzmans capture to the 1993 killing of Pablo Escobar of Colombias Medellin cartel once a powerful criminal organization Its demise opened the way for other cartels to grow including SinaloaIn fact some fear Guzmans capture could spark more violence though no Mexican cartel seems strong enough at the moment to make a major play Sinaloas main rivals the Zetas have been substantially weakened and other groups have become too local to rival Guzmans international reachA greater risk may be the fragmentation of Guzmans cartel as internal factions vie for pieces of the pie though most experts foresee a smooth transition of powerIt could mean a new distribution of territory in the country said Javier Valdez founder of the Riodoce newspaper in Culiacan and author of With a Grenade in the Mouth about drug war victimsSince Guzman escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001 he built his cartel into the largest in the world with tentacles extending from Argentina to Australia Nobody outside the cartel leadership knows the extent of its power or business but estimates are that Sinaloa handles 25 percent to 45 percent of all drugs entering the United States with revenues around 3 billion a year Last year Forbes named Guzman the worlds 67th most powerful person between US Speaker of the House John Boehner and New York Times Executive Editor Jill AbramsonSinaloa is believed to operate with an extended network of officials and lookouts on the payroll especially in the western Mexico state of Sinaloa for which the cartel is named Both a state and federal police chief have been arrested for alleged ties to Sinaloa or its allies only to later be released When the Mexican marines mounted their raid on Guzmans hideout Saturday it was without alerting any local law enforcementLocal and state authorities are in the service of the Sinaloa cartel Valdez saidThe difference may lie in whether Guzman is extradited to the United States where he has been indicted in at least seven US judicial districts said Edgardo Buscaglia an expert on the cartel and senior scholar at Columbia UniversityIn the US he wont be able to escape like he did from a Mexican prison and could provide key information Mexican authorities on Monday announced that Guzman had been formally charged starting a legal process that could make swift extradition unlikelyEven though the longterm fate of Sinaloa is unclear everyone agrees on the bottom line Drugs will continue to flow even with the takedown of other Mexican cartelsIn drug trafficking as long as there is demand there will be a supply Valdez said Its like energy You cant create or destroy it It only

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/06/booming/i-may-be-50-but-dont-call-me-a-boomer.html,There is no baby boom generationOh sure there was a baby boom a neatly defined piginthepython bulge from 1946 to 1964 But the kind of broadly shared cultural experiences that could bind together people across that whole span That just didnt happenThis year the youngest of the baby boomers  the youngest mind you  turn 50 I hit that milestone a few months back But we arent what people usually have in mind when they talk about boomers They mean the early boomers the postwar cohort most of them now in their 60s not us later boomers labeled Generation Jones by the writer Jonathan PontellThe boom generation really has two distinct halves which in my mind I call Boomer Classic and Boomer Reboot Take this quiz to see where you stand The differences between them have to do not surprisingly with sex drugs and rock n roll  and economics and war For a wideranging set of attitudes and cultural references it matters whether you were a child in the 1940s and 50s or in the 1960s and 70s And it probably matters even more whether you reached adulthood before or after the early 70s a time of headspinning changes with longterm consequences for families careers and even survivalThe end of the war in Vietnam makes for one especially sharp dividing line In 1973 the ceasefire was signed United States forces withdrew and the last American draftees were inductedIf you were an early boomer even if you were not drafted or shipped to Vietnam you had friends classmates or relatives who were The fathers you knew had served in World War II and probably thought their sons should answer the call too The war was a raw central presence in young peoples lives and in the nations cultural and political battlesLate boomers like me had none of that  no war no draft no defining political cause and most of our fathers were too young for World War II I remember as a teenager seeing old footage of the riots outside the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago and thinking People my age dont feel that strongly about anythingPeople raised in the immediate postwar years had more faith in their government and an idealistic view of America that curdled in the 60s and 70s My childhood memories of the evening news on the other hand include the war protests Watergate and the dour faces of Johnson and Nixon not the grins of Truman Eisenhower and KennedyIn this way I think we late boomers have more in common with the jaded Generation X that followed we had less idealism to spoil No I dont remember where I was when Kennedy was killed and innocence died I was an infant but I sure remember where I was when Nixon resigned and cynicism reigned Older boomers may have wanted to change the world most of my peers just wanted to change the channelAnother line between the eras runs through the bedroom Its not that premarital sex casual sex and even anonymous sex were unknown in earlier times But when early boomers were teenagers in the back seats of their cars it was understood that sex was dangerousThen came the birth control pill first marketed in 1961 but because of various state laws not universally accessible until 1972 and legal abortion Roe v Wade was in 1973 They helped create a window of time 10 to 15 years when for the first time people could convince themselves and many did that there could be sex without consequencesAIDS slammed that window shut in the 1980s but it was in that opening that late boomers reached adolescence and early adulthood developed their sexual attitudes and embarked on their sex lives People my age took for granted the sexual freedom that had been revolutionary to older boomers But if sex got easy then marriage it seemed got hard More babies were born to single mothers and between the late 1950s and the late 70s the divorce rate tripled Compared with early boomers my cohort was a lot more likely to grow up with only one parent aroundIf you were born in the late 40s you probably didnt know anybody who had tried illegal drugs while you were in high school maybe not even into your 20s If you tried anything yourself it probably felt like a big deal a transgression or even a statement If you were a little younger from the middle of the boom you were more likely to know drug users but it was still a dividing line a kind of usandthem markerThen the floodgates opened once again in the 1970s When the Gallup organization asked about marijuana use in 1969 8 percent of adults under 30 admitted to having tried it A mere eight years later it was 56 percent We late boomers going to high school in the 70s knew plenty of people who had tried drugs when we were in high school including teachers and parents and we knew many more in college To a lot of us marijuana never seemed like a very big dealMacroeconomics form another dividing line also in the early 70s By then nearly all of the firsthalf boomers had finished school and started their working lives They had lived through a period of historic economic growth when it seemed a rising tide really did lift all boatsPeople just a few years younger grew up with that kind of prosperity but it evaporated when they reached the age to seize it From 1973 to 1982 the United States suffered through three recessions two energy crises inflation and high unemployment  a disillusioning time to establish a careerThings were different still for those of us at the tail end of the boom We grew up with the pessimism of that era but we entered the work force during the 80s boom when the tide lifted many boats but not othersThe boomer generation also straddles a revolution in the roles of women with the first half more likely to fight past old assumptions and the second more likely to reap the gains When early boomers were children and young adults American women were far less likely than men to go to college or hold jobs The gaps narrowed slowly for decades but here again an inflection point came in the early 70s when womens numbers began to soarIn 1970 women were 41 percent of college students by 1979 they were a majority In 1972 51 percent of American women ages 25 to 54 were in the work force by 1989 the figure was 74 percentIn pop culture theres just no parallel in the amount of political content darkness and skepticism we grew up with Firsthalf boomers got all of those things but later in life and they were new and challenging for us they were part of the landscape The early boomers were born into a world without rock n roll swearing in the media or even much in the way of really harsh satire A lot of us late boomers cant remember a time before the British Invasion Hunter S Thompson and George CarlinThe gap between the two halves of the baby boom might be best

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/02/24/world/americas/ap-lt-drug-war-mexico-cartel-future.html,MEXICO CITY   Like a Fortune 500 company losing its chief executive the powerful Sinaloa cartel is likely to stay in business at least in the short term selling billions of dollars of illegal drugs despite the arrest of its legendary leader Joaquin El Chapo GuzmanBut the longerterm fate of a criminal ring likened to an international corporation is anything but clear as authorities pursue other top leaders and weaker rivals dream of moving inGuzmans arrest Saturday was undoubtedly a major blow coming on the heels of more than a dozen arrests of key lieutenants and lowerlevel operators in recent months Yet the cartel still has a worldwide distribution network and is the major supplier of cocaine to the United States The operation did not touch the cartels immense political power nurtured through the bribery of corrupt officials or its thriving money laundering operationsAs long as these other structures remain in place all things being equal Sinaloa will be able to continue to operate if not as normal at least as the most powerful criminal organization in Mexico  said David Shirk director of the University of San Diegos Justice in Mexico ProjectGuzman who made Forbes magazines lists of billionaires and most powerful people was first among equals with partners Ismael El Mayo Zambada and Juan Jose Esparragoza known as El Azul both of whom remain at largeDespite rumors to the contrary Guzman worked closely with Zambada Guillermo Valdes former head of Mexicos top domestic intelligence agency said the pair shared a clear vision not only with respect to their adversaries but also with their business plan for trafficking cocaine marijuana heroin and methamphetamine in some 54 countriesOn Monday a senior Drug Enforcement Administration official told The Associated Press that the current drug intelligence assessment indicates that Zambada is likely to be the next chief of the Sinaloa cartelThe official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss specific details of Guzmans arrest in Mexico said the DEA doesnt anticipate that Guzmans absence will have an immediate effect on cartel operations because it has evolved from a gang into a worldwide organizationIn other recent takedowns of major cartels the Mexican government had to hit more than one leader before the organizations were dismantled or scattered into smaller gangs One by one the Arellano Felix brothers in Tijuana were arrested or killed over the last decade as were the Beltran Leyva brothers from 2008 to 2011 Though the Mexican marines killed Zeta leader Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano in October 2012 the power of the group did not diminish until the other leader Miguel Angel Trevino Morales was arrested last summerSome predict Sinaloa is about to suffer the same fateUS Rep Michael McCaul who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security said to expect more arrests because authorities penetrated the cartels communications system in catching GuzmanOur ability to crack their code will not bode well for their future he said comparing Guzmans capture to the 1993 killing of Pablo Escobar of Colombias Medellin cartel once a powerful criminal organization Its demise helped grow cartels such as SinaloaWhen Escobar fell the cartels started to unravelIn fact some fear Guzmans capture could spark more violence though no Mexican cartels seem strong enough at the moment to make a major playSinaloas main rivals the Zetas have been substantially weakened and other groups have become too local to rival Guzmans international reachA greater risk may be the fragmentation of the cartel as internal groups vie for pieces of the pie though most see a smooth transition of powerIt could mean a new distribution of territory in the country said Javier Valdez founder of the Riodoce newspaper in Culiacan and author most recently of With a Grenade in the Mouth about drugwar victimsSince Guzman escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001 he grew his cartel to be one of the largest in the world with tentacles extending from Argentina to Australia Nobody outside the cartel leadership knows the extent of its power or business but estimates are that Sinaloa handles 25 to 45 percent of all drugs entering the United States with revenues around 3 billion a year Last year Forbes named Guzman the worlds 67th most powerful person between US Speaker of the House John Boehner and New York Times Executive Editor Jill AbramsonSinaloa is believed to operate with an extended network of officials and lookouts on the payroll especially in the western Mexico state for which the cartel is named Both a state and federal police chief have been arrested for alleged ties to Sinaloa or its allies only to later be released When the Mexican marines mounted their offensive on Saturday it was without alerting any local law enforcementLocal and state authorities are in the service of the Sinaloa cartel Valdez saidThe difference may lie in whether Guzman is extradited to the United States where he has been indicted in at least seven federal district courts said Edgardo Buscaglia an expert on the cartel and senior scholar at Columbia UniversityIn the US he wont be able to escape like he did from a Mexican prison in 2001 and could provide key information Mexican authorities on Monday announced that Guzman had been formally charged starting a legal process that could make swift extradition unlikelyEven though the longterm fate of Sinaloa is unclear everyone agrees on the bottom line The drugs will still continue to flow even with the takedown of other Mexican cartelsIn drug trafficking as long as there is demand there will be a supply Valdes said Its

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/24/opinion/keller-crime-and-punishment-and-obama.html,I DOUBT any president has been as well equipped as Barack Obama to appreciate the vicious cycle of American crime and punishment As a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s he would have witnessed the way a system intended to protect the public siphoned off young black men gave them an advanced education in brutality and then returned them to the streets unqualified for  and too often given the barriers to employment faced by those who have done time disqualified from  anything but a life of more crime He would have understood that the suffering of victims and the debasing of offenders were often two sides of the same coinIts hard to tell how deeply he actually absorbed this knowledge In the Chicago chapters of his memoir Dreams From My Father Obama notes that in the lowincome housing projects prison records had been passed down from father to son for more than a generation but he has surprisingly little to say about the shadow cast by prisons on the families left behind about the way incarceration became the default therapy for drug addicts and the mentally ill about the abject failure of rehabilitationStill when the former community organizer took office advocates of reform had high expectationsIn March I will give up the glorious platform of The Times to help launch something new a nonprofit journalistic venture called The Marshall Project after Thurgood Marshall the great courtroom champion of civil rights and devoted to the vast and urgent subject of our broken criminal justice system It seems fitting that my parting column should address the question of how this president has lived up to those high expectations so farIll begin by making his excuses The presidents powers in this area are limited The action and there is a lot of it right now is mostly at the state level His first term was entangled in economic crisis and health care This president has faced tireless and often petty resistance from the Republican House on almost every initiative Historically Democrats have risked being WillieHortoned if they dont maintain a tougherthantoughoncrime posture And AfricanAmerican constituents  who are also disproportionately the victims of crime  are not necessarily bleedingheart voters In short it was probably nave to assume that Obama was going to be the Criminal Justice Reform PresidentAnd yet Obama took office at a time of tidal shifts The economics of imprisonment the ebbing of crime rates the horror stories of overcrowded penitentiaries and the persistent activism of reform advocates had begun to generate a public consensus that merely caging people is not a crimefighting strategy Fiscal conservatives alarmed at the high cost of incarceration evangelicals shocked by the waste of lives and libertarians who spotted another realm of government power abused have clambered onto what was once a liberal bandwagon How much those conservatives will be willing to invest in alternative ways of protecting the public  drug treatment more intensive parole and probation programs job training and so on  is another questionIn his first term Obama did not make this a signature issue he rarely mentioned the subject But his proxy Attorney General Eric Holder Jr was outspoken from the start Six months into the first term he was already at the Vera Institute of Justice in New York talking about the social costs of mass incarceration and pressing for policies that would divert lowlevel drug offenders to treatment and ease the reentry of former prisoners into a productive life In the last five years Holder has become increasingly bold and encountered little backlash This month he exhorted states to repeal policies that deny felons the right to vote policies that disenfranchise 58 million Americans including nearly one in 13 AfricanAmerican adults He framed it not just as an act of compassion but as a way of reengaging prodigal soulsBy perpetuating the stigma and isolation imposed on formerly incarcerated individuals these laws increase the likelihood they will commit future crimes Holder saidAll that sounds very good said Michelle Alexander the legal scholar who wrote The New Jim Crow a scorching 2010 indictment of the racialized war on drugs And it is good because for decades the rhetoric was running in the other direction But if the rhetoric is not matched with action  then it is fair to wonder whether the shift in rhetoric reflects significant shifts in public opinion in recent years rather than a real commitment to these issues and a willingness to take political risksIn practice the administrations record has been more incremental than its rhetoricBy the crudest metric the population of our prisons the Obama administration has been unimpressive The famously shocking numbers of Americans behind bars the US with 5 percent of the worlds people incarcerates nearly a quarter of all prisoners on earth have declined three years in a row However the overall downsizing is largely thanks to California and a handful of other states In overstuffed federal prisons the population continues to grow fed in no small part by Obamas crackdown on immigration violatorsThe administration has some achievements to tout Obama signed the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act and has put some muscle behind the Smarter Sentencing Act two measures aimed at making drugsentencing laws less absurd Holder has issued guidance to prosecutors to avoid routinely seeking maximum sentences for lowlevel offenders  though its not clear yet whether prosecutors are going along The administration created an Interagency Reentry Council that uses federal guidance to whittle away at the barriers to employment housing and education so that released prisoners have some hope of becoming productive citizensAt the same time long after the War on Drugs has been recognized as a failure there has been little serious effort to cut the number of federal drug prosecutions or to shift money from incarceration to drug treatment Alexander cites as a significant disappointment the continued federal reluctance to decriminalize marijuana despite Obamas acknowledgment to David Remnick of The New Yorker that pot is less harmful than alcohol and that the laws are mostly enforced against poor minorities Another missed opportunity he could have pushed more aggressively to fill district and circuit court vacancies with judges who would buck the status quoObama has also been the stingiest of recent presidents in using his powers of pardon and commutation to undo the damage of the crack panic and of sentencing that keeps prisoners in lockup long past the age when they represent a danger Marc Levin director of the Center for Effective Justice at the Texas Public Policy Foundation a conservative think tank with a justice reform agenda points out that in his first term Obama pardoned one in 50 applicants while Ronald Reagan pardoned one in three Late last year Obama commuted the sentences of eight drug offenders out of more than 8000 federal convicts serving time under outdated crack lawsObama is we know a cautious man leery of getting ahead of public opinion and therefore sometimes far behind it And some reform advocates argue that it made sense for Obama to keep a low profile until a broad bipartisan consensus had gathered That time has come Now that Obamascorners like Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee and even Ted Cruz are slicing off pieces of justice reform for their issue portfolios now that red states like Texas Georgia South Carolina Missouri and Kentucky have embraced alternatives to prison criminal justice is one of those rare areas where there is common ground to be explored and testedThe Obama presidency has almost three years to go and there is reason to hope that he will feel less constrained that the eight commutations were not just a pittance but as he put it a first step that Holders mounting enthusiasm for saner sentencing is not just talk but prelude that the president will use his great pulpit to prick our conscienceThis is something that matters to the president Holder assured me last week This is I think going to be seen as a defining legacy for this administrationIll be watching and hoping that Holders prediction is more than wishful thinking,2014-02-24T00:00:00Z,drugs

from Denver and a young man who had driven all day from Ohio Some were longtime marijuana users Some had been arrested for marijuana possessionThey were among the hundreds of tourists and residents across Colorado who eagerly took part in the countrys firstever sales of stateregulated recreational marijuana They walked into 40 shops from downtown Denver to snowy ski resorts flashed their identifications and in a single transaction took part in what supporters hailed as a historic departure from drug laws focused on punishment and prohibitionIt makes you giddy to say it I went into a store and bought pot Linda Walmsley said as she walked out of the Denver Kush Club where a line of shivering customers stretched down the blockWhile about 20 states allow medical marijuana voters in Colorado and Washington State decided last year to go one step further becoming the first in the nation to legalize small amounts of the plant for recreational use and regulate it like alcohol Colorado began promptly on New Years DayTo supporters it was a watershed moment in the countrys tangled relationship with the drug They said it was akin to the end of Prohibition albeit with joints being passed instead of Champagne being uncorkedTo skeptics it represented a grand folly that they predicted would tarnish the image of a state whose official song is John Denvers Rocky Mountain High and lead to higher teenage drug use and more impaired driving The governor and the Denver mayor both opposed legalization and stayed away from the celebrations and inaugural sales on WednesdayRegulators said Colorados first sales  on a day called Green Wednesday by enthusiasts  went smoothly Security guards were stationed outside dispensaries and police officers and state officials watched closelySkeptical federal authorities are also paying attention Although marijuana remains illegal under federal law the Justice Department has given tentative approval for Colorado and Washington to move ahead with regulating marijuana But it warned that federal officials could intervene if the state regulations failed to keep the drug away from children drug cartels or federal property and out of other statesOn Wednesday Colorado had eight investigators out checking retailers licenses inspecting packaging and labeling and ensuring that stores reviewed customers identification to see if they were 21 or older said Ron Kammerzell the director of enforcement for Colorados Department of RevenueSo far so good he saidEver since voters in Colorado and Washington approved recreational marijuana last year the states have been racing to devise rules on how to grow it sell it tax it and track itIn both Colorado and Washington recreational marijuana has been legal for more than a year Adults can smoke it in their living rooms and eat marijuanalaced cookies without fear of arrest In Colorado they are even allowed to grow up to six plants at home But until Wednesday marijuana dispensaries could sell only to customers with a doctors recommendation and a stateissued medical marijuana cardMany people who lined up on Wednesday said they did not have medical cards and had relied on drug dealers or friends with medical marijuana to satisfy their cravings They were paying high prices for new recreational marijuana  50 to 60 for an eighth of an ounce nearly double the price of medical marijuana  but said it was worthwhile to avoid the riskPeople dont like breaking the law said Andy Williams who runs the Medicine Man dispensary in an industrial park in Denver The burden has been taken off themNow any Colorado resident who is at least 21 can buy up to an ounce of marijuana at one of the dispensaries that began selling to retail customers on Wednesday Outofstate visitors can buy a quarterounce but they have to consume it here Carrying marijuana across state lines remains illegal and the plant is not allowed at Denver International AirportOn Wednesday some tourists puzzled over where they would consume their purchases It is illegal to smoke marijuana in public in public parks or in campgrounds and it is against the rules at many hotels One group from Nebraska said it would find a parking lot and roll up the car windows Others said they would return to their hotels and crack the windows Some bought marijuanalaced baked goods to avoid the problem altogetherKirstin Knouse 24 flew here from Chicago with her husband Tristan to take her first marijuana vacation and she said the couple would smoke their marijuana at the home of a cousin She said that she suffered from seizures and fibromyalgia and her husband from posttraumatic stress but that they had not been able to get medical marijuana at home When Colorado opened sales to outofstate residents she said they leapt at the chanceThis is our dream Ms Knouse said Were thinking about moving here because of itWashingtons marijuana system is at least several months behind Colorados meaning that fully stocked retail shelves probably will not be a reality for consumers until perhaps JuneWhile Colorado has incorporated the existing medical marijuana system Washington is starting from scratch with all production and sale of legal recreational marijuana linked to a new system of licenses which will not be issued until late February or early MarchAfter that it is up to the industry to get it up and running said Mikhail Carpenter a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board which regulates the system and is reviewing almost 5000 license applications to grow process or sell marijuanaGrowers can start a crop only after they get a license Mr Carpenter said and retailers can sell only marijuana produced in the state by licensed growersWhat happens next in both states will be watched closely by Arizona Alaska California Oregon and other states flirting with the idea of liberalizing their marijuana laws Questions still abound Will drug traffickers take marijuana across state lines to sell elsewhere Will recreational marijuana flow from the hands of legal adult consumers to teenagers Will taxes from marijuana sales match optimistic predictions of a windfall for state budgets What will happen to the black market for marijuanaBut on Wednesday enthusiasts like Darren Austin 44 and his son Tyler 21 just embraced the moment They arrived a few months ago from Georgia and North Carolina respectively and decided to stay The father said marijuana eased his anxiety and helped him quit drinking and the son said he simply liked smoking it with

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/02/19/nyregion/ap-us-nyc-bomb-plot.html,NEW YORK   A man accused of building homemade bombs to wage holy war in New York City pleaded guilty Wednesday to a terrorism charge less than a week before his scheduled trial in a rare statelevel terrorism caseJose Pimentel wearing a knitted skull cap softly answered questions and shook his head at times as he acknowledged hed tried to craft a pipe bomb in 2011 with the idea of using it to make a violent impact on US foreign policyHe sought according to a statement a judge read on his behalf to try to undermine public support for the wars in Iraq and AfghanistanPimentel pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a weapon as a crime of terrorism Authorities have called the case a dramatic example of the threat of homegrown oneperson terrorism plots but his lawyers have portrayed it as an example of overzealous policing in the years since Sept 11With the plea Pimentel 29 was promised a sentence of 16 years in prison He could have faced a minimum of 15 years to life if convicted Jury selection had been due to start MondayTodays guilty plea further supports the fact that increasingly the threat of terrorism comes from radicalized local actors living in our community Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R Vance Jr said at a news conferenceBut Pimentels lawyers have suggested he would never have progressed from posting online to trying to make pipe bombs if police hadnt sent a series of informants to engage with himWhile he admitted his guilt the question that will not be answered at least not in a court of law is who exactly is recruiting whom in this war against terrorism said one of his attorneys Susan WalshPimentel also known as Muhammad Yusuf is a Dominican immigrant who was raised in the US and converted to Islam around 2004He maintained a website with articles praising Osama bin Laden describing Sept 11 victims as legitimate targets and listing reasons to nuke the USA prosecutors said in court papers He repeatedly clashed with his former wife because of his militant beliefs about Islam and his mother had thrown him out of her apartment over his views prosecutors saidHis vitriol deepened in 2011 when he was recorded talking about assassinating a judge killing returning soldiers and bombing a police station or the George Washington Bridge officials said he also talked about targeting Jews Assistant District Attorney Deborah Hickey said He was arrested that November as he assembled bombs from clocks Christmas tree lights matchhead scrapings and other items acquired at dollar shops and hardware stores prosecutors saidOne informant and an undercover officer had gotten nowhere with Pimentel Walsh and fellow Pimentel lawyer Lori Cohen said But then police sent another informant a fellow Hispanic Muslim convert who smoked joints with Pimentel while they talked about jihad accompanied him to buy bomb makings and opened his apartment to Pimentel to put the materials togetherIf you work on someone with professional witnesses if you acquiesce to marijuana use you wear people down Walsh said last monthVance said he was comfortable with the way the investigation was conductedThe defense had indicated his trial would examine the New York Police Departments intelligencegathering on Muslims which came under scrutiny in stories by The Associated Press that showed how the department infiltrated Muslim student groups put informants in mosques and monitored sermons as part of a broad antiterrorism effortVance said prosecutors offered the plea deal to secure a significant sentence without the uncertainties of a trial Pimentels lawyers said he took the offer to avoid the possibility of life in prisonEntrapment defenses or arguing that police induced crime face a high legal burden Its not enough to show that police or their agents created an opportunity for lawbreaking a defendant has to convince jurors that police used methods that risk getting an innocent person to commit a crimeMost terrorism cases are federal but Pimentel was charged under a New York state law passed shortly after Sept 11 and seldom used sinceOne case involved a Bronx gang leader whose conviction was overturned when appeals courts said his crimes werent what the law envisionedIn another Vance charged two men with plotting to blow up synagogues Both pleaded guilty One is serving 10 years in prison and the other is serving fiveAfter Pimentels arrest two law enforcement officials said the FBI had passed on his case because agents felt he wasnt inclined or able to act without the informants involvement the officials were not authorized to speak about the case and spoke on condition of anonymityVance and Police Commissioner William Bratton said Wednesday that state charges were appropriate in Pimentels caseThere are some who suggest that only federal agencies should handle terrorism cases or that the terrorism threat from radicalized citizens is perhaps overstated Vance said I strongly disagree___Associated Press writer Tom Hays contributed to this report Reach Jennifer Peltz on Twitter  jennpeltz,2014-02-19T10:26:50Z,drugs

massive search through the home state of the legendary capo whose global organization is the leading supplier of cocaine to the United StatesJoaquin El Chapo Guzman 56 looked pudgy bowed and much like his wanted photos when he arrived in Mexico City from Mazatlan in Sinaloa state He was marched by masked marines across the airport tarmac to a helicopter waiting to whisk him to jailMarines arrested Guzman at 640 am in a highrise condominium fronting the Pacific without firing a single shot Mexican officials late Saturday said he was apprehended with a man identified as Carlos Manuel Hoo Ramirez contradicting earlier reports that he was arrested with a womanAn American official said that the US Drug Enforcement Administration and the Marshals Service were heavily involved in the captureAnother federal law enforcement official said intelligence from a Homeland Security Department investigation also helped lead US and Mexican authorities to his whereaboutsBoth officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to journalistsUS Attorney General Eric Holder called the capture a victory for the citizens of both Mexico and the United StatesMexican authorities based on a series of arrests in recent months got wind that Guzman was moving around Culiacan capital of his home state for which the cartel is namedMexican Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam described an operation that took place between Feb 13 and 17 focused on seven homes connected by tunnels and to the citys sewer systemHe said they had Guzman in their sights several times during that period but were unable to mount an operation earlier because of possible risks to the general public The house doors were reinforced with steel which delayed entry by law enforcement presumably allowing Guzman to flee several attempts at his capture before SaturdayA US law enforcement official said members of Guzmans security team helped Mexican and US authorities find him after they were arrested earlier this month The official was not authorized to discuss details of the case by name and spoke on condition of anonymityGuzman faces multiple federal drug trafficking indictments in the US and is on the DEAs mostwanted list His drug empire stretches throughout North America and reaches as far away as Europe and Australia His cartel has been heavily involved in the bloody drug war that has torn through parts of Mexico for the last several yearsHis arrest followed the takedown of several top Sinaloa operatives in the last few months and at least 10 midlevel cartel members in the last weekMichael S Vigil a former senior DEA official who was briefed on the operation said the Mexican navy raided the Culiacan house of Guzmans exwife Griselda Lopez earlier this week and found a cache of weapons and a tunnel in one of the rooms that led to the citys sewer system leading authorities to believe Guzman barely escaped Vigil saidAs more people were arrested more homes were raidedIt became like a nuclear explosion where the mushroom started to expand throughout the city of Culiacan Vigil saidAuthorities learned that Guzman fled to nearby Mazatlan He was arrested at the Miramar condominiums a 10story pearlcolored building with white balconies overlooking the Pacific and a small pool in front The building is one of dozens of relatively modest uppermiddleclass developments on the Mazatlan coastal promenadeHe got tired of living up in the mountains and not being able to enjoy the comforts of his wealth He became complacent and starting coming into the city of Culiacan and Mazatlan That was a fatal error said VigilVigil said Mexico may decide to extradite Guzman to the US to avoid any possibility that he escapes from prison again as he did in 2001 in a laundry truck  a feat that fed his largerthanlife personaIt would be a massive black eye on the Mexican government if he is able to escape again Thats the only reason they would turn him over Vigil saidBecause insiders aided his escape rumors circulated for years that he was helped and protected by former President Felipe Calderons government which vanquished some of his top rivalsIn the bilateral assault on organized crime and Mexican drug cartels Sinaloa had not only been relatively unscathed but has seen its enemies go down at the hands of the governmentAggressive assaults by the Mexican military and federal police have all but dismantled the leadership of the Beltran Leyva and Zetas cartels both huge rivals of Sinaloa as well as the La Linea gang fighting Sinaloa for control of the border city of Ciudad JuarezCalderon congratulated Pena Nieto on the capture Saturday via his Twitter account Many also noted the huge boost that capture gave to the credibility of the Pena Nieto government whose commitment to fighting organized crime has been questioned since he took office in late 2012But there were rumors circulating for months that a major operation was underway to take down the Sinaloa cartelZambadas son was arrested in November after entering Arizona where he had an appointment with US immigration authorities to arrange legal status for his wifeThe following month Zambadas main lieutenant was killed as Mexican helicopter gunships sprayed bullets at his mansion in the Gulf of California resort of Puerto Penasco in a fourhour gunbattle Days later police in the Netherlands arrested a flamboyant top enforcer for Zambada as he arrived in AmsterdamBut experts predict that as long as Guzmans partner Ismael El Mayo Zambada is at large the cartel will continue business as usualThe takedown of Joaquin El Chapo Guzman Loera is a thorn in the side of the Sinaloa Cartel but not a dagger in its heart said College of William and Mary government professor George Grayson who studies Mexicos cartels  Zambada  will step into El Chapos boots He is also allied with Juan Jose El Azul Esparragoza Moreno one of most astute lords in Mexicos underworld and by far its best negotiatorRumors had long circulated that Guzman was hiding everywhere from Argentina and Guatemala to almost every corner of Mexico especially its Golden Triangle a mountainous marijuanagrowing region straddling the northern states of Sinaloa Durango and ChihuahuaIn more than a decade on the run Guzman transformed himself from a middling Mexican capo into arguably the most powerful drug trafficker in the world His fortune has grown to more than 1 billion according to Forbes magazine which listed him among the Worlds Most Powerful People and ranked him above the presidents of France and VenezuelaHis Sinaloa Cartel grew bloodier and more powerful taking over much of the lucrative trafficking routes along the US border including such prized cities as Tijuana and Ciudad JuarezGuzmans play for power against local cartels caused a bloodbath in Tijuana and made Juarez one of the deadliest cities in the worldHis cartels tentacles now extend as far as Australia thanks to a sophisticated international distribution system for cocaine and methamphetamineGuzman did all that with a 7 million bounty on his head and while evading thousands of law enforcement agents from the US and other countries  A US federal indictment unsealed in San Diego in 1995 charges Guzman and 22 members of his organization with conspiracy to import over eight tons of cocaine and money laundering A provisional arrest warrant was issued as a result of the indictment according to the US State DepartmentHe also has been indicted by federal authorities in the United States several times since 1996 The charges include allegations that he and others conspired to smuggle multiton quantities of cocaine into the US and used violence including murder kidnapping and torture to keep the smuggling operation runningIn 2013 he was named Public Enemy No 1 by the Chicago Crime Commission only the second person to get that distinction after US prohibitionera crime boss Al CaponeAn estimated 70000 people have been killed in drug violence since former President Calderon deployed thousands of soldiers to drug hotspots upon taking office on Dec 1 2006 Mexicos current

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/us/politics/in-emissions-case-supreme-court-to-consider-the-limits-of-obamas-authority.html,WASHINGTON   President Obama in recent days has been announcing muscular executive actions to address climate change making good on his promise to act on pressing problems with or without Congress On Monday the Supreme Court will consider the limits of that approach in a case on greenhouse gas emissionsThe justices are poised to decide whether the Obama administration went too far in trying to regulate emissions from stationary sources like power plants In the process they are likely to weigh in on a central Republican critique of Mr Obama that he is misusing his executive authorityAmanda C Leiter a law professor at American University said the case might have only a modest impact because the administration would retain other regulatory tools should its approach be rejectedIt is far more important as a matter of optics than of actual legal consequences she said If the government loses she said it would be painted as another situation in which the Obama administration has overreached against the public willBriefs filed in the Supreme Court by business groups and Republican lawmakers pressed that theme one that hewed closely to criticism of the administrations delays in carrying out the Affordable Care Act its decision not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act in court and its tolerance of state marijuana laws in Colorado and WashingtonA brief from Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and other House Republicans said the regulations under challenge were an intolerable invasion of Congresss domain that threatens to obliterate the line dividing executive from legislative powerThe brief added that the regulations were perhaps the most audacious seizure of pure legislative power over domestic economic matters attempted by the executive branch since President Harry S Truman tried to take control of the nations steel mills during the Korean WarThe administration and environmental groups responded that the Clean Air Act was a broad grant of authority to the executive branch that allowed sensible tailoring of its statutory text by the Environmental Protection Agency to address new threats to the environmentThe EPA determined Solicitor General Donald B Verrilli Jr wrote in his brief to the Supreme Court that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare in ways that may prove to be more widespread longer lasting and graver than the effects of any other pollutant regulated under the actThe case that will be heard on Monday involves interlocking judicial decisions statutory provisions and agency regulations complicated enough to make Rube Goldberg blush But one aspect of it concerns the straightforward question of whether the Obama administration overstepped its constitutional authority by reinterpreting the Clean Air Act to avoid what it called absurd resultsThe challenged regulations built on the Supreme Courts 5to4 decision in 2007 in Massachusetts v Environmental Protection Agency which required the agency to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles if it found that they endangered public health or welfareThe agency made such a finding saying that elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere pose a danger to current and future generations and it set limits on emissions from new vehicles Mr Obamas announcement on Tuesday calling for new regulations to reduce carbon emissions from heavyduty trucks was also based on the 2007 Supreme Court decision and the agencys findingThe agency also issued regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources like power plants While acknowledging that the relevant provisions of the Clean Air Act fit such emissions imperfectly the agency said the law nonetheless compelled it to require permitsStates and industry groups challenged the various regulations on many grounds with the US Chamber of Commerce calling them the most burdensome costly farreaching program ever adopted by a United States regulatory agencyA threejudge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously rejected all of the challenges some on the merits and some on the ground that the parties before the court lacked standing to pursue themWhen the full appeals court declined to rehear the case Judge Brett M Kavanaugh dissented and he identified the ground that would turn out to interest the Supreme Court He said the agency had gone astray in revising the text of the statuteThe task of dealing with global warming is urgent and important Judge Kavanaugh wrote but it is primarily one for Congress to address The framers of the Constitution he added did not grant the executive branch the authority to set economic and social policy as it sees fitThe agency said its regulation of tailpipe emissions also required regulation of emissions from stationary sources under two permitting programs The Clean Air Act says those programs cover all sources that can annually emit 100 or 250 tons of the relevant pollutant a threshold that works tolerably well for conventional air pollutants like lead and carbon monoxide But that threshold applied to greenhouse gases which are emitted in far greater amounts would require the regulation of millions of sources of pollutionAll sides agree that requiring permits at the statutory thresholds would impose enormous burdens Wed be regulating momandpop stores said Peter S Glaser a lawyer for the Washington Legal Foundation which filed a supporting brief opposing the regulationsApplying the law as written would increase the number of covered sources under one program from fewer than 280 to more than 80000 reaching commercial and residential sources and subjecting them to expenses averaging almost 60000 according to the appeals court A second program would reach six million sources subjecting them to expenses of more than 20000 each The cost of the programs would rise to 21 billion from 62 millionThe agency said Congress could not have intended such an absurd result Its solution was to raise the statutory emissions threshold to 75000 to 100000 tons per year thus reaching far fewer facilities This was Mr Verrilli told the justices a permissible exercise of discretion and one subject to tightening over timeTexas and other states challenging the agencys actions acknowledged that the higher thresholds resulted in less regulation but told the appeals court that this proved only that the EPA was acting as a benevolent dictator rather than a tyrantThe Supreme Court considered nine petitions seeking review of the appeals courts decision on many grounds and it accepted six of them But it limited the issue it would consider to whether the agency permissibly determined that its regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles triggered permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act for stationary sources that emit greenhouses gases Among the cases accepted for review was Utility Air Regulatory Group v Environmental Protection Agency No 121146The question was narrow and it appeared spurred by Judge Kavanaughs dissent Environmental groups said they were pleased that the court had not questioned the agencys finding that greenhouse gases pose a danger or that it can regulate tailpipe emissions They added that the agency has other tools to regulate stationary sources should it lose in the pending caseThe case has divided the states along predictable lines A Supreme Court brief filed by Texas and a dozen other states called the challenged regulations one of the most brazen power grabs ever attempted by an administrative agency while a brief filed by New York and 14 other states said the agencys gradual transition to more comprehensive regulation was a reasonable and temporary accommodation to certain practical implementation problems,2014-02-20T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/01/31/sports/football/ap-fbn-paul-newberry-013114.html,NEW YORK   Jermaine Kearse smiled before the question was even finishedShould the NFL  and all professional leagues for that matter  stop testing players for marijuanaAwww man why do you have to put me on the spot like that the Seattle Seahawks receiver gripedPersuaded this wasnt one of those gotcha moments during Super Bowl week Kearse tepidly came up with a replyWhatever is best for the players he saidThe best thing for players in every league be it the NFL NBA NHL or Major League Baseball would be to remove pot from the list of banned substances No one should ever have to endure what Seattle cornerback Brandon Browner is going throughInstead of playing in the biggest game of his life hes stuck at home forced to watch the game on TV like most everyone else because of a positive test for marijuana Since he had also tested positive as a rookie back in 2005 not to mention some issues over whether he should have continued to be tested even when he wasnt employed by an NFL team Browner is suspended indefinitely and could wind up missing a full seasonIf marijuana is legal in some states I dont understand how an employer has the right to control what an employee does after working hours said Peter Schaffer Browners agent Its just not rightNo its notThe NFL Players Association needs to get crackin on this issue right away even as it tries to reach agreement with the league on a matter that has gotten far more attention testing for human growth hormone a performance enhancing drug that is difficult to detectAs it stands now pot is lumped with cocaine meth opiates and PCP as a banned substance of abuse even though theres no evidence to suggest that its nearly as harmful as those more powerful drugs In fact proponents of legalizing marijuana will insist that it causes fewer problems than booze and they make a pretty compelling caseIn the NFL the first positive test for any of those drugs requires a player to enter the leagues treatment program Subsequent violations result in a fine and then a fourgame suspensionThe NBAs policy on marijuana is similar treatment after the first positive test a 25000 fine if it happens again a fivegame suspension for the third violationThe NHLs policy is a bit murky with league and union officials giving conflicting answers over possible penalties for marijuana use Essentially it seems if a hockey player has dangerously high levels of pot in his system during testing  whatever that means  he is placed in the leagues substanceabuse programThe guidelines in baseball are the most convoluted of all setting different standards for major and minor leaguers For those on the 40man roster the use of marijuana hashish and synthetic THC is not subject to a suspension and there have been no announced penalties of any kind for pot use since the Joint Drug Agreement went into effect more than a decade ago For those with minorleague contracts a second positive test brings a 50day suspension a third violation results in a 100game ban and a fourth gets you kicked out of the game for goodThe issue of legalizing marijuana has come to the forefront since both Colorado and Washington took that very step and the Super Bowl has become a convenient conduit for those on both sides of the issue since the AFC champion Denver Broncos and NFC champion Seahawks come from those states Not far from MetLife Stadium dueling billboards were put up by supporters and opponents of legalizationSome have dubbed it The Stoner Bowl and even NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith has some fun with the issueWhat kind of joint is this he joked at his stateoftheplayersunion news conferenceBut there are serious issues that need to be addressed especially when it comes to studying the medicinal uses of marijuana There are many who believe it can help players cope with pain in the short term and better deal with the longrange effects of their brutal game To his credit NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says the league could consider marijuana as a possible treatment for concussions if theres science to back it upThese guys are hurting theyre in pain Schaffer said They go through 60 or 70 train wrecks every SundayWhile most players dodged marijuana questions during Super Bowl week  even the outspoken Richard Sherman  Schaffer has no doubt that a majority would be in favor of dumping pot from the testing program In fact he believes that might be a way to break the stalemate over HGH testing  the players could sign off on the leagues proposed policy in exchange for removing marijuana as a banned substanceFormer NFL player Brendon Ayanbadejo  best known for his support of gay marriage  said he knew of teammates smoking marijuana right in the hotel before one of his Super BowlsMost telling he sounded like it was no big dealI would much rather have my teammates smoking weed Ayanbadejo wrote on Twitter than popping highly addictive narcotics___,2014-01-31T17:41:12Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/01/11/us/ap-us-medical-marijuana.html,NEW YORK   Gov Andrew Cuomo made a political splash by introducing a medical marijuana plan in the State of the State speech but his cautious approach has been met with skepticism from pot advocates who question whether the proposal is mostly for showWhile nearly two dozen states have OKd marijuana for medical purposes and Colorado and Washington have legalized its use for pleasure Cuomo is tapping a 1980 state law to allow as many as 20 hospitals to dispense the drug to people with certain severe illnesses as an experimental research projectIm absolutely thrilled that hes actually verbalized the words medical marijuana but hes just got to go further said Susan Rusinko a 52yearold central New York resident who said a hit of pot is a wonder drug that relaxes immobilizing leg spasms from her multiple sclerosis Its unclear whether she would even qualify for Cuomos initiative or whether there would be a participating hospital near herThe governors office has yet to detail how the program would overcome key hurdles including the lack of a legal unadulterated supply of marijuana in the state and a federal law that still makes it illegal for doctors to write a prescriptionWhile advocates are frustrated Cuomos limited embrace of medical marijuana may be both politically astute and scientifically sensitiveSome medical experts say that while the marijuana plant holds tantalizing possibilities for treating problems ranging from chemotherapyrelated nausea to chronic pain popular enthusiasm for the drug has outpaced a weak body of medical researchCuomos initiative is styled as a test of whether pot can be effectively used as medicine without being abusedThis does not start with a premise Oh this is a slam dunk  We can do it without any ancillary problems he told reporters Monday Its the exact oppositeUnder his plan people with cancer glaucoma and possibly some other lifethreatening or sensethreatening conditions could seek to get marijuana through studies based at hospitals yet to be named with stringent research protocols and eligibility requirementsCuomos initiative bypasses a state Legislature that has declined to pass more ambitious medical marijuana laws Hes relying instead on his administrative powers to carry out a 1980 law allowing medicalmarijuana research A number of states passed such measures in that eraThen California took a broader step voting in 1996 to let doctors recommend cannabis for various conditions Nineteen other states have since enacted medical marijuana laws While the drug remains illegal under federal law US prosecutors were told in 2009 not to focus on people using it medically under state lawsCritics feel medical marijuana is an entree to more recreational use of a drug that was widely outlawed in the US in the 1930s I think it sends the wrong signal to our young people said Michael Long chairman of the New York Conservative PartyFederal regulators have approved a few prescription drugs containing a synthetic version of the marijuana ingredient THC But few clinical trials have been done to test whether the plant in its raw form is better than conventional therapies partly because of federal restrictions on such research notes Aron Lichtman a pharmacology professor at Virginia Commonwealth University and the president of the International Cannabinoid Research SocietyThere are all sorts of claims being made without any proper testing So its sort of a conundrum he saidDr J Michael Bostwick a Mayo Clinic psychiatrist who studies medical marijuana issues sees therapeutic potential in cannabis But he also has concerns that it is being dispensed in some states by questionable providers who make unsubstantiated claims about the drugs powers and provide little or no actual medical care or evaluationHe said Cuomos proposal seems to address some of those concerns by putting dispensaries within hospitals but he said some New York hospitals might be wary of participating for fear of running afoul of federal authoritiesIf hospitals do get on board it isnt clear where they would get the marijuana New Yorks 1980 law envisioned a possibility that the drug could be obtained from law enforcement agencies but experts say pot seized from drug dealers could pose a safety hazard The drug cant be imported from states where it is grown legally Obtaining marijuana grown by federal authorities for research purposes is notoriously difficultStill pharmaceutical pot is popular with New Yorkers A Quinnipiac University poll in June found 70 percent of voters support itAnd for Cuomo the issue represents an opportunity to plant a flag on the left  but not too far  as he faces reelection amid talk of presidential ambitions in 2016 Cuomo enjoys favorability ratings around 55 and 60 percent in recent polls but some of the states Democratic limelight has been shining lately on newly installed staunchly liberal New York City Mayor Bill de BlasioCuomo had said as recently as April that he opposed medical marijuana but that his thinking was evolving With his new plan he can at least say Im pushing forward this conversation said Christina Greer a political science professor at Fordham UniversityAdvocates who want state lawmakers to pass a broader medical marijuana law question how workable Cuomos program would be and how many people it would helpIt moves New York forward all the way to 1980 said Gabriel Sayegh the New York state director of the Drug Policy Alliance a group critical of warondrugs governingCarly TangneyDecker isnt waiting for answers She and her husband believe a particular strain of marijuana available through a Colorado dispensary could help their

version of the story is belowWash Colo have few ways to stop carryon weedWash Colo officials have few ways to stop travelers from getting pot by airport securityDENVER AP  Among the many oddities that have arisen from marijuana legalization in Washington and Colorado is this It can be easier to get through airport security with a bag of weed than a bottle of waterAt Washingtons airports including SeattleTacoma International theres nothing police can do to prevent travelers from flying with pot in their carryon or checked luggage provided it doesnt exceed the state legal limit of one ounce Instead airport officials say officers simply recommend that travelers leave it in their cars toss it or have a friend pick it upBut in Colorado where the legal pot law gives property owners more authority to restrict the drug some airports have banned marijuana possession and enacted penalties including fines as high as 2500 and a jail stint at the airport in Colorado SpringsCarrying marijuana in a civilian aircraft is illegal under federal regulations Thats why we implemented the rule to prevent marijuana from reaching a civilian aircraft said airport spokeswoman Kim Melchor adding that the airport has yet to levy a fine and that a dropbox where travelers can toss excess weed hasnt been usedThe situation underscores the difficulty officials in both states have as they try to prevent pot from leaving their borders  one of several conditions the Department of Justice imposed when it allowed the legal pot experiments to proceedAn attorney with Smart Colorado which is

people from trying to bring back souvenirs from the legalpot statesThe Transportation Security Administration makes travelers empty their water bottles but when agents encounter personal amounts of marijuana at security checkpoints they typically dont call the DEA or FBI Federal prosecutors dont waste their time on such small potatoes An agency spokesman said TSAs focus is on terrorism and

advocates say is too greatSean McAllister a lawyer who is on the board of the Colorado chapter of NORML a pot legalization group said that medical marijuana patients used to be allowed to fly with

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/nyregion/new-york-state-is-set-to-loosen-marijuana-laws.html,ALBANY   Joining a growing group of states that have loosened restrictions on marijuana Gov Andrew M Cuomo of New York plans this week to announce an executive action that would allow limited use of the drug by those with serious illnesses state officials sayThe shift by Mr Cuomo a Democrat who had long resisted legalizing medical marijuana comes as other states are taking increasingly liberal positions on it  most notably Colorado where thousands have flocked to buy the drug for recreational use since it became legal on Jan 1Mr Cuomos plan will be far more restrictive than the laws in Colorado or California where medical marijuana is available to people with conditions as mild as backaches It will allow just 20 hospitals across the state to prescribe marijuana to patients with cancer glaucoma or other diseases that meet standards to be set by the New York State Department of HealthWhile Mr Cuomos measure falls well short of full legalization it nonetheless moves New York long one of the nations most punitive states for those caught using or dealing drugs a significant step closer to policies being embraced by marijuana advocates and lawmakers elsewhereNew York hopes to have the infrastructure in place this year to begin dispensing medical marijuana although it is too soon to say when it will actually be available to patientsMr Cuomos shift comes at an interesting political juncture In neighboring New Jersey led by Gov Chris Christie a Republican whose presidential prospects are talked about even more often than Mr Cuomos medical marijuana was approved by his predecessor Jon S Corzine a Democrat but was put into effect only after Mr Christie set rules limiting its strength banning home delivery and requiring patients to show they have exhausted conventional treatments The first of six planned dispensaries has already openedMeanwhile New York Citys new mayor Bill de Blasio had quickly seemed to overshadow Mr Cuomo as the states leading progressive politicianFor Mr Cuomo who has often found common ground with Republicans on fiscal issues the sudden shift on marijuana  which he is expected to announce on Wednesday in his annual State of the State address  was the latest of several instances in which he has embarked on a major social policy effort sure to bolster his popularity with a large portion of his political baseIn 2011 he successfully championed the legalization of samesex marriage in New York And a year ago in the aftermath of the mass school shooting in Newtown Conn Mr Cuomo pushed through legislation giving New York some of the nations toughest guncontrol laws including a strict ban on assault weapons He also has pushed unsuccessfully so far to strengthen abortion rights in state lawThe governors action also comes as advocates for changing drug laws have stepped up criticism of New York Citys stringent enforcement of marijuana laws which resulted in nearly 450000 misdemeanor charges from 2002 to 2012 according to the Drug Policy Alliance which advocates more liberal drug lawsDuring that period medical marijuana became increasingly widespread outside New York with some 20 states and the District of Columbia now allowing its useMr Cuomo voiced support for changing drug laws as recently as the 2013 legislative session when he backed an initiative to decriminalize socalled open view possession of 15 grams or less And though he said he remained opposed to medical marijuana he indicated as late as April that he was keeping an open mindHis shift according to a person briefed on the governors views but not authorized to speak on the record was rooted in his belief that the program he has drawn up can help those in need while limiting the potential for abuse Mr Cuomo is also up for election this year and polls have shown overwhelming support for medical marijuana in New York 82 percent of New York voters approved of the idea in a survey by Siena College last MayStill Mr Cuomos plan is sure to turn heads in Albany the states capital Medical marijuana bills have passed the State Assembly four times  most recently in 2013  only to stall in the Senate where a group of breakaway Democrats shares leadership with Republicans who have traditionally been lukewarm on the issueMr Cuomo has decided to bypass the Legislature altogetherIn taking the matter into his own hands the governor is relying on a provision in the public health law known as the Antonio G Olivieri Controlled Substance Therapeutic Research Program It allows for the use of controlled substances for cancer patients glaucoma patients and patients afflicted with other diseases as such diseases are approved by the commissionerMr Olivieri was a New York City councilman and state assemblyman who died in 1980 at age 39 Suffering from a brain tumor he used marijuana to overcome some of the discomfort of chemotherapy and until his death lobbied for state legislation to legalize its medical useThe provision while unfamiliar to most people had been hiding in plain sight since 1980But with Mr Cuomo still publicly opposed to medical marijuana state lawmakers had been pressing ahead with new legislation that would go beyond the Olivieri statuteRichard N Gottfried a Manhattan Democrat who leads the assemblys health committee has held two public hearings on medical marijuana in recent weeks hoping to build support for a bill under which health care professionals licensed to prescribe controlled substances could certify patient needMr Gottfried said the states historical recalcitrance on marijuana was surprisingNew York is progressive on a great many issues but not everything he saidMr Gottfried said he wanted a tightly regulated and licensed market with eligible patients limited to those with severe lifethreatening or debilitating conditions not the broader range of ailments  backaches and anxiety for instance  that pass muster in places like California which legalized medical marijuana in 1996What we are looking at bears no resemblance to the California system Mr Gottfried saidWhile he was aware of the Olivieri statute he believed it had not been implemented because it would have required an elaborate administrative approval process which he said could be overly burdensome on patientsEthan Nadelmann the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance praised Mr Cuomos decision as a bold and innovative way of breaking the logjam in Albany though it may not be the final word on medical marijuanaMr Cuomo remains committed to developing the best medical marijuana law in the country Mr Nadelmann said And thats going to require legislative actionThe administration has much work to do before its program is operational For starters it must select the participating hospitals which officials said would be chosen to assure regional diversity and according to how extensively they treat patients with or research pertinent illnesses like cancer or glaucomaAnother hurdle State and federal laws prohibit growing marijuana even for medical uses though the Obama administration has tolerated it So New York will have to find an alternative supply of cannabis The likely sources could include the federal government or law enforcement agencies

cigarettefree America but shied away from calling for smoking rates to fall to zero or near zero by any particular year The power of tobacco companies and popularity of their products made such a goal seem like a pipe dreamBut a confluence of changes has recently prompted public health leaders to start throwing around phrases like endgame and tobaccofree generation Now they talk about the slowlydeclining adult smoking rate dropping to 10 percent in the next decade and to 5 percent or lower by 2050Acting US Surgeon General Boris Lushniak last month released a 980page report on smoking

federal health official has spoken so boldly In 1984 Surgeon General C Everett Koop called for a smokefree society by the year 2000 However Koop  a bold talker on many issues  didnt offer specifics on how to achieve such a goalWhats different today is that we have policies and programs that have been proven to drive down tobacco use said Matthew Myers president of the Campaign for TobaccoFree Kids We couldnt say that in 1984Among the things that have changedCigarette taxes have increased around the country making smokes more expensive Though prices vary from state to state on average a pack of cigarettes that would have sold for about 175 20 years ago would cost more than triple that nowLaws banning smoking in restaurants bars and workplaces have popped up all over the country Airline flights have long been offlimits for smokingPolls show that cigarette smoking is no longer considered normal behavior and is now less popular among teens than marijuanaFederal officials are increasingly aggressive about antismoking advertising The Food and Drug Administration launched a new youth tobacco prevention campaign last week At about the same time the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention debuted a  third 60million round of its successful antitobacco ad campaign  this one featuring poignant deathbed images of a woman featured in earlier adsTobacco companies once considered impervious to legal attack have suffered some huge defeats in court Perhaps the biggest was the 1998 settlement of a case brought by more than 40 states demanding compensation for the costs of treating smokingrelated illnesses Big Tobacco agreed to pay about 200 billion and curtail marketing of cigarettes to youthsRetailing of cigarettes is changing too CVS Caremark the nations secondlargest pharmacy chain announced last week it will stop selling tobacco products at its more than 7600 drugstores The company said it made the decision in a bid to focus more on providing health care but medical and public health leaders predicted pressure will increase on companies like Walgreen Co and WalMart Stores Inc to follow suitI do think in another few years that pharmacies selling cigarettes will look as anachronistic as old cigarette ads featuring physician endorsements look today said CDC Director Dr Tom FriedenThese developments have made many in public health dream bigger Its caused Myers organization and others to recently tout the goal of bringing the adult smoking rate down to 10 percent by 2024 from the current 18 percent That would mean dropping it at twice the speed it declined over the last 10 yearsThe bigger goal is to reduce US smokingrelated deaths to fewer than 10000 from the current level of 480000 But even if smoking rates dropped to zero immediately it would take decades to see that benefit since smokingtriggered cancers can take decades to developBut while some experts and advocates are swinging for the fences others are more pessimistic They say the key to reaching such goals is not simply more taxes and more local smoking bans but action by the US Food and Drug Administration to regulate smokingA 2009 federal law gave the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products The law barred FDA from outright blocking the sale of cigarettes but the agency was free to take such pivotal steps as prohibiting the use of appealing menthol flavoring in cigarettes and requiring cigarette makers to ratchet down the amount of addictive nicotine in each smokeBut nearly five years after gaining power over cigarettes FDA has yet to even propose such regulations Agency officials say theyre working on itMany believe FDAs delay is driven by defense preparations for an anticipated battery of legal and political challengesA spokesman for Altria Group Inc the maker of Marlboro said the company supports FDA exercising its regulatory authority over tobacco products But as a whole the industry has tended to fight regulation Some of the nations largest tobacco companies  though not Altria  sued to stop FDAproposed graphic warning labels on cigarette packs A federal court blocked the adsThe industry makes money as long as they can delay regulation said Kenneth Warner a University of Michigan public health professor who is a leading authority on smoking and healthWarner and Michigan colleague David Mendez estimate that barring any major new tobacco control victories the adult smoking rate will drop from its current 18 percent only to about 12 percent by 2050 If health officials do make huge strides the rate could drop as low as 6 percent they thinkBut Lushniak said zero Will that ever happenSome experts doubt it As long as cigarettes and other combustible tobacco products are legal its likely some people will smoke them Efforts to prohibit them are likely to fail they say Remember ProhibitionIts hard to do a ban on cigarettes because youre taking something away from people they have and are using Once you have something you hold tight said Richard Daynard a Northeastern University law professor who focuses on tobacco issuesBetter he said to bar people from having a product in the first place He is intrigued by legal efforts in Singapore and a handful of other countries to ban sales of tobacco to anyone born after a certain year  2000 say That would be constitutional he said The question is Would our culture accept itProbably not said Ruth Malone editorinchief of the scientific journal Tobacco ControlIn our culture we tend to think we have a right to things even if theyre terrible for us she saidA growing number of experts believe the most promising option is to get people to switch voluntarily to something else like electronic cigarettesElectronic cigarettes are batterypowered devices that provide users with aerosol puffs that typically contain nicotine and sometimes flavorings like fruit mint or chocolate Theyve often been described as a less dangerous alternative to regular cigarettes But there are few studies exploring exactly what chemicals are in them and in what concentrations and whether those levels are harmfulTheyre controversial Some experts believe that at a time when cigarette smoking has finally become passe in popular culture ecigarettes may reglamorize puffing away in public places Cigarette sales could surgeIt could go in either direction said John Seffrin the American Cancer Societys chief executive officerBut if the FDA can ratchet down nicotine in conventional cigarettes to levels below whats in ecigarettes perhaps everyone who clings to smoking will switch to the highernicotine new products That could achieve the end of smoking at least of combustible carcinogenfilled cigarettes  or so the thinking goesIn the past the country really wasnt ready to walk away from cigarettes Daynard said I think the countrys ready now___OnlineThe new CDC antismoking ads httpwwwcdcgovfeaturesSmokersTips2014,2014-02-09T17:38:38Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/us/justices-decide-on-air-safety-steelworkers-and-drug-dealers.html,WASHINGTON   Airlines may not be held liable for minor falsehoods in warning the authorities about potential threats to air security the Supreme Court ruled on Monday The court also issued decisions on whether workers must be paid for time spent changing into protective gear and on enhanced sentences for drug dealers whose products result in deathThe court threw out a jurys award of 12 million to a pilot who was removed from a plane questioned and searched after his employer told the Transportation Security Administration that he had just been fired was mentally unstable and might be carrying a gunThe pilot William L Hoeper failed a series of tests he needed to pass to qualify to fly a new kind of aircraft Mr Hoeper ended the fourth test abruptly cursing and shouting His employer Air Wisconsin Airlines booked Mr Hoeper on a flight home to Denver and after internal deliberations contacted the transportation agencyThe justices were unanimous in ruling that the Colorado Supreme Court had applied the wrong legal standard in upholding the jury award when it said that true statements may give rise to liability The United States Supreme Court drawing on its libel decisions said only materially false statements should countBut the justices split 6 to 3 over whether the gaps between what the airline had told the authorities and what was strictly true was broad enough to allow the suit Mr Hoeper would not be fired until the next day was authorized to carry a gun as a flight deck officer but was unarmed that day and was upset but perhaps not mentally unstableJustice Sonia Sotomayor writing for the majority said a few inaptly chosen words were not enough to support the verdictBaggage handlers flight attendants gate agents and other airline employees who report suspicious behavior to the TSA should not face financial ruin if in the heat of a potential threat they fail to choose their words with exacting care she wroteIn dissent on this point Justice Antonin Scalia said the court had decided too much and should have instead sent the case back to the lower courts to apply the correct legal standard He said it was hardly clear that the airlines characterization of the pilots conduct was materially accurate In particular he said Mr Hoepers frustration and anger may not have entitled the airline to call him mentally unstable Justices Clarence Thomas and Elena Kagan joined the partial dissentJustice Sotomayor responded that Mr Hoeper was not an ordinary traveler partly because he was authorized to carry a firearm Hoeper was not some traveling businessman who yelled at a barista in a fit of pique over a badly brewed cup of coffee she wroteThe case Air Wisconsin Airlines Corp v Hoeper No 12315 concerned a federal law the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001 It gave airline employees broad immunity from lawsuits for reports of suspicious activitiesThe law had an exception based on the actual malice standard in the Supreme Courts 1964 decision in New York Times v Sullivan for statements made with knowing falsity or reckless disregard of the truth In the portion of her opinion that was unanimous Justice Sotomayor said the defamation standard must be adapted to fit the 2001 law Materiality for purposes of libel suits she said turns on whether the statement affects the subjects reputation in the communityIn the context of the 2001 law she went on we care whether a falsehood affects the authorities perception of and response to a given threatA Suit Over ClothesThe court unanimously rejected a suit filed by steelworkers who asked to be paid for the time it took them to put on and take off their work clothes which included flameretardant outerwear gloves boots hard hats safety glasses earplugs and hoodsThe Fair Labor Standards Act excludes time spent changing clothes from its pay requirements and Justice Scalia writing for the court considered the meaning of those two words with careClothes he concluded are items designed and used to cover the body and commonly regarded as articles of dress That they may also have a protective function he said made no differenceChanging he continued does not only mean substitution as the steelworkers had argued It includes time spent in altering dressThat means he concluded that donning and doffing of the protective gear at issue qualifies meaning that the workers were not entitled to be paid for the time doing itIn announcing the decision in the case Sandifer v United States Steel Corp No 12417 Justice Scalia reflected on donning and doffing which he said were two good old AngloSaxon words that are not much used any moreHe noted two exceptions We still sing Don we now our gay apparel at Christmas he said and I suppose a wellbred gentleman still doffs his hat to a ladyRelief in Drug DeathThe court unanimously ruled in favor of Marcus A Burrage a drug dealer convicted not only of selling heroin but also of being responsible for the death of one of his customers Joshua Banka The second charge carried a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prisonJustice Scalia writing for seven justices said that Mr Burrage had played only a contributing role in causing Mr Bankas deathBefore he died in 2010 Mr Banka ingested a prodigious assortment of drugs He smoked marijuana crushed cooked and injected OxyContin took a variety of prescription drugs and injected heroin he had bought from Mr BurrageAt his trial medical experts said the heroin had been a factor in Mr Bankas death But they could not say given the other drugs he had ingested that he would not have died anywayJustice Scalia wrote that Mr Burrage should not have been convicted under a federal law that requires mandatory sentences if death or serious bodily injury results from drugs sold by a defendant At least where use of the drug distributed by the defendant is not an independently sufficient cause of the victims death or serious bodily injury a defendant cannot be liable under the penalty enhancement provision of the law Justice Scalia wrote unless such use is a butfor cause of the death or injuryJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined by Justice Sotomayor agreed with the result but not the reasoning in the case Burrage v United States No 127515 She said Justice Scalias reasoning on causation could be harmful in cases concerning employment discrimination and that she would have relied on the principle that ambiguous criminal laws should be interpreted in favor of the defendant,2014-01-28T00:00:00Z,drugs

opened for business in Colorado on Wednesday with long lines of customers marking a new chapter in Americas drug cultureRoughly three dozen former medical marijuana dispensaries newly cleared by state regulators to sell pot to consumers interested in nothing more than its mind and moodaltering properties began welcoming customers as early as 8 am MST 1500 GMTHundreds of patrons some from distant states and many huddling outside in the bitter cold and snow for hours cued up to be among the first buyersThis is an historic moment Jacob Elliott 31 a defense contractor from Leesburg Virginia near Washington DC said in line outside the 3D Cannabis Center in Denver I never thought it would happenThe highlyanticipated New Years Day opening launched an unprecedented commercial cannabis market that Colorado officials expect will ultimately gross 578 million in annual revenues including 67 million in tax receipts for the statePossession cultivation and private personal consumption of marijuana by adults for the sake of just getting high has already been legal in Colorado for more than a year under a state constitutional amendment approved by votersAs of Wednesday however cannabis was being legally produced sold and taxed in a system modeled after a regime many states have in place for alcohol sales  but which exists for marijuana nowhere in the world outside of ColoradoEven in the Netherlands where some coffee shops and nightclubs are widely known to sell cannabis products with the informal consent of authorities backend distribution of the drug to those businesses remains illegalCustomer No 1 at Botana Care in the Denver suburb of Northglenn was Jesse Phillips 32 an assemblyline worker who had camped outside the shop since 1 amROCKY MOUNTAIN HIGHI wanted to be one of the first to buy pot and no longer be prosecuted for it This end of prohibition is long overdue Phillips saidA cheer from about 100 fellow customers as Phillips made his purchase an eighthounce sampler pack containing four strains of weed  labeled with names such as King Tut Kush and Gypsy Girl  that sold for 45 including taxHe also bought a childproof carry pouch required by state regulations to transport his purchase out of the storeBack at 3D Cannabis two patrons from Blanchester Ohio  Brandon Harris and his friend Tyler Williams both 24  said they had been waiting since 230 am for doors to openWe wanted to be the first people from Ohio to buy it legally Harris saidRobin Hackett 51 coowner of Botana Care said she expected between 800 to 1000 firstday customers and hired a private security firm to help with any traffic and parking issues that might ariseTwo inspectors from the Colorado Department of Revenue were on site as the shop was set to open Were just here to help with compliance issues one of them Dave Miller saidHackett said she has 50 lbs 23 kg of product on hand and to avoid a supply shortage the shop will limit purchases to quarterounces on Wednesday including joints raw buds cannabisinfused edibles such as pastries or candies and even infused soaps oils and lotionsLike other stores Botana Care also stocked related wares including pipes rolling papers and bongsVoters in Washington state voted to legalize marijuana at the same time Colorado did in November 2012 but Washington is not slated to open its first retail establishments until later in 2014TURNING POINT IN DRUG CULTUREStill supporters and detractors alike see the two Western states as setting a course that could mark the beginning of the end for marijuana prohibition at the national levelThe era of marijuana prohibition is officially over in Colorado said Mason Tvert a spokesman for the prolegalization Marijuana Policy ProjectMaking marijuana legal for adults is not an experiment he told a news conference Prohibition was the experiment and the results were abysmalHe and other supporters of the change point to tax revenues to be gained and argue that antimarijuana enforcement has accomplished little over the years but to penalize otherwise lawabiding citizens especially minoritiesCritics say anticipated social harms of legalization from declines in economic productivity to a rise in traffic and workplace accidents outweigh any benefitsThey also warn that legalizing recreational use could help create an industry intent on attracting underage users and getting more people dependent on the drugCannabis remains classified as an illegal narcotic under federal law though the Obama administration has said it will give individual states leeway to carry out their own recreationaluse statutesNearly 20 states including Colorado and Washington had already put themselves at odds with the US government by approving marijuana for medical purposesComparing the nascent pot market to the alcohol industry former US Representative Patrick Kennedy cofounder of Project Smart Approaches to Marijuana said his group aims to curtail marijuana advertising and to help push local bans on the drug while the industry is still modest in statureThis is a battle that if we catch it early enough we can prevent some of the most egregious adverse impacts that have happened as a result of the commercialized market that promotes alcohol use to young people he saidUnder Colorado law however state residents can buy as much as an ounce 28 grams of marijuana at a time while outofstate visitors are restricted to quarterounce purchasesRestraint was certainly the message being propagated on New Years Eve by Colorado authorities who posted signs at Denver International Airport and elsewhere around the capital warning that pot shops can only operate during approved hours and that open public consumption of marijuana remains illegalWriting and additional

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/02/01/us/ap-us-knox-trial-the-perceptions.html,SEATTLE   To some Americans especially those in her hometown of Seattle Amanda Knox seems a victim unfairly hounded by a capricious legal system in Italy that convicted her this week in the death of a 21yearold British womanBut in Europe some see her as a privileged American who is getting away with murder embroiled in a case that continues to make global headlines and reinforces a negative image of US citizens behaving badly  even criminally  abroad without any punishmentAs she remains free in the US the perceptions will likely fuel not only the debate about who killed Meredith Kercher in 2007 and what role if any Knox played in her death but complicate how the US and Italian governments resolve whether she should be sent to Italy to face prisonIts been a polarizing case and that polarization will remain said Anne Bremner a Seattle attorney and Knox supporterThe divergent views on who killed Kercher are rooted not just in the typical dynamics of a legal case in which the two sides hold opposing narratives but also in the differences between the justice systems in the US and Italy and examples of Americans avoiding Italian justiceAfter being first convicted and then acquitted Knox and her onetime boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were convicted again Thursday following their third trial Knox was sentenced to 28 12 years Sollecito to 25 years The courts reasoning isnt expected to be released for three monthsThe tone of some British newspaper coverage reflected skepticism about Knoxs protestations of innocence Shameless in Seattle was the frontpage headline on Saturdays Daily Mail which referred to Knoxs brazen TV charm offensive to escape extraditionAny decision on whether to return Knox to Italy will ultimately be made by the US State DepartmentThere have been other highprofile cases in which Italians hoped in vain to have Americans face justice there notably the case of a US Marine jet that sliced a gondola cable in the Italian Alps in 1998 killing 20 peopleUnder NATO rules the US military retained jurisdiction and the pilot was acquitted of manslaughterMore recently in 2009 Italian courts convicted  in absentia  26 CIA and US government employees in the kidnapping of an Egyptian cleric suspected of recruiting terrorists in MilanSome lawyers familiar with the process say Knox has little hope of avoiding extradition under the terms of the USItaly treaty but that wont stop her supporters from mounting a campaign to keep her in the USTheyre appealing to American principles about trying someone multiple times for the same crime even though under Italian law her earlier conviction and subsequent acquittal were never finalized and even her third trial was considered part of the first prosecution against herTheyre also asking how one appellate court could find her actually innocent while another court convicts her beyond a reasonable doubtKercher 21 was found dead in the bedroom of the apartment she and Knox shared in the town of Perugia where they were studying Kercher had been sexually assaulted and her throat slashedInvestigators claimed it had been a drugfueled sex game gone awry  an accusation that made the case a tabloid sensationKnox now 26 and Sollecito now 29 denied any involvement After initially giving confused alibis they insisted they were at Sollecitos apartment that night smoking marijuana watching a movie and having sexBut police and news media focused on what was described as Knoxs bizarre behavior afterward  shopping for underwear embracing Sollecito and turning cartwheels for police as she became a suspectMeanwhile a third defendant was arrested and convicted separately Ivory Coastborn Rudy Guede a drug dealer whose DNA was found was found in the room where Kercher was killed and who acknowledged being there the night of the murderFor Knoxs detractors there remains that after her arrest she implicated an innocent man  Diya Patrick Lumumba the Congolese owner of a pub where Knox occasionally workedKnox said she made those statements under duress during an overnight interrogation when she had neither a lawyer nor a professional interpreter and when she had been asked to imagine what might have happened Her supporters say such an interrogation would never have been allowed in the USFor Knoxs supporters the initial police theory about the sex game was farfetched much more complicated than what they saw was the more plausible explanation that Guede killed Kercher by himselfAnd the fact that prosecutors abandoned that theory for the most recent trial instead arguing that the motive was an argument over cleanliness in the apartment further illustrates that law enforcement was grasping they sayAs Knox awaits her fate the questions over who killed Kercher will continue Knoxs supporters for example released an electronic book arguing that Guede acted alone in the killing Kerchers siblings wonder if theyll ever know what really happenedSome in Italy however seem to be coming to one conclusion the prosecutors didnt have much evidenceThe Rome daily La Repubblica wrote Friday that the third verdict confirms that the case from the very beginning has been judged more on the basis of sensation than actual evidenceIt suggested Knox and Sollecito had always been the perfect culprits and that in reality what is probably more at stake than assigning responsibility for a murder is the prestige of a part of the magistrature and the Umbrian police___Associated Press

shops to open They ate doughnuts and funnel cakes as a glassblower made smoking pipes Some tourists even rode around in a limo eager to try weed but not so eager to be seen buying itAnd when the sales began those who bought the drug emerged from the stores receipt held high and carrying sealed shopping bags to cheersIm going to frame the receipt when I go home to remind myself of what might be possible Legal everywhere said musician James Aaron Ramsey 28 who did some time in jail for pot possession in Missouri and played folk tunes with his guitar for those in lineActivists hope hes right and that the experiment in Colorado will prove to be a better alternative to the costly Americanled drug war produce the kind of revenue that state officials hope and save the government costs in locking up drug offendersJust on the first day prices in some places rose to more than 500 an ounce and some shops announced midafternoon they would close early because of short supply Its too soon to say whether the price spikes and long lines will persistWashington state will open its pot industry later this year Both states programs will be watched closely not just by officials in other states but by activists and governments in other countries because the industries will be the first to regulate the production and sale of the drugSome countries have decriminalized the drug and the Netherlands lets people buy and sell it but its illegal to grow or process itJust as shops opened Wednesday the Denver Police Department tweeted Do you know the law and linked to city websites on

more than a year ago soon after Colorado and Washington voters in 2012 approved legal pot industries Uruguay passed a law in December to become the first nation to regulate pot but regulatory system

and save money by not locking up lowlevel drug offendersI feel good about it The moneys going to schools said shopper Joseph Torres of DenverThe price for highquality weed at some shops was around 400

addiction problems especially in youths and that wider pot availability will exacerbate the problemThis is just throwing gas on the fire said Ben Cort of the Colorado Center for Dependency Addiction

from the preexisting medical inventory Many in the industry warned patients to stock up before the sales beganIt was too soon to tell whether prices for medical marijuana patients were going upFor now they should have plenty of places to shop Most of Colorados 500 or so medical marijuana shops havent applied to sell recreational pot and many that have plan to serve both recreational and medical

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/02/04/us/04reuters-usa-agriculture-farmbill-factbox.html,Reuters  A US farm bill was passed by the US Senate on Tuesday and sent to President Barack Obama for his expected signature The legislation which was approved by the House of Representatives last week will cost an estimated 956 billion over 10 years a savings of about 166 billion compared with current funding according to the Congressional Budget OfficeThe following are some provisions of the wideranging legislation which comprises everything from food stamps and farm subsidies to meat labeling and crop insurance httpwwwgpogovfdsyspkgBILLS113hr2642ehpdfBILLS113hr2642ehpdf FOOD STAMPSFunding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program commonly known as food stamps was cut by about 900 million a year or roughly 1 percent SNAP and other nutrition programs account for more than threequarters of the farm bills spending  some 756 billion over a decade Liberal lawmakers argued against the reduction at a time of relatively high unemployment Conservatives said the cuts did not go far enough in a program whose spending has more than doubled since 2008 The savings are expected to come from reducing benefits to people who are also enrolled in a federal heating assistance program An estimated 850000 households in 16 states and District of Columbia will lose about 90 a month in SNAP benefitsDIRECT PAYMENTSThe legislation ends a nearly twodecadeold program of direct payments to farmers which cost about 5 billion a year and went to farmers and landowners no matter how much money they made or even whether they actually farmed their land At a time of rising farm income the plan had become politically untenable With the end of direct payments lawmakers have instead expanded and revised crop insurance programs and the expansion could put the government on the hook for bigger payouts in times of poor harvestsCOUNTRY OF ORIGIN LABELINGThis provision which has been around since the 2002 farm bill requires meat sold in the United States to be labeled as to where animals are born grown and processed It remained in the 2014 bill despite heavy lobbying from the meat industry which said it was a bookkeeping nightmare for meatpackers Mexico and Canada two of the largest exporters of beef to the United States have challenged COOL at the World Trade Organization US ranchers and consumer groups largely support COOL arguing that consumers deserve to know where their meat comes fromDAIRYThere was a battle between Democratic Representative Collin Peterson of Minnesota backed by dairy farmers and Republican House Speaker John Boehner over Petersons proposal to couple a new margin insurance program with a system to cut milk production if prices fell below a certain level Boehner who had the support of cheesemakers and food processors who want lower milk prices said he would not allow a vote in the House if it included Petersons supply management plan The final bill excluded supply management but made changes to the insurance plan and Peterson said he could live with the compromiseKING AMENDMENTThis amendment intended to block a California law requiring that all eggs sold in the state come from chickens kept in nonconfining cages was included in the Housepassed bill but was dropped from the final legislation Critics said the provision pushed by Republican Representative Steve King of Iowa could have invalidated hundreds of state laws on animal protection and food safety King supported by egg growers in Iowa and other states said the California law violated the interstate commerce clause of the US ConstitutionPAYMENT IN LIEU OF TAXESRural counties in the West breathed a sigh of relief after the farm bill included a payment in lieu of taxes program PILT which pays local governments for the tax revenue they cannot collect on federal lands The 400 millionayear program was a late addition to the farm bill after it was not included in the January budget deal A bipartisan group of 16 senators had urged that PILT be included in the farm legislationCATFISHUS catfish farmers and Southern lawmakers successfully fought to a keep a provision first authorized in the 2008 farm bill that shifted catfish inspection to the Agriculture Department from the Food and Drug Administration Critics including Senator John McCain Arizona Republican called the provision a trade barrier designed to protect catfish farmers from imports mostly from Vietnam But supporters say USDA inspections would be more rigorous in the interests of food safety They had a powerful ally in Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi the top Republican on the Agriculture Committee who managed to keep the provision despite the Government Accountability Office saying it was wasteful and unnecessaryHEMP RESEARCHWith marijuana laws loosening supporters of industrial hemp saw an opening and pushed through a provision that allows colleges and state agencies to grow and conduct research on the crop in the nine states where it is legal Kentucky is among them and Mitch McConnell the top Republican in the Senate was a big backer of the provision Industrial hemp which can be used to make clothing food building materials and a number of other products has low levels of the chemical that gets people high Growing or using it is illegal under federal lawBIOFUEL BLENDER PUMPSA provision removes subsidies for fuel pumps in rural areas that blend gasoline with higher concentrations of biofuels like cornbased ethanol Ending the subsidies was a blow to the Obama administration which in 2010 set a goal of helping gas station owners install blender pumps over the next five years to promote consumption of higherethanol gasolineCHRISTMAS TREE TAXFiscal conservatives are particularly incensed by a provision in the bill that imposes a 15cent fee on every freshcut Christmas tree sold in the United States with the money being used to promote demand for trees Critics call it a tax and say it will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices Christmas tree growers say the fee which is expected to raise about 2 million a year is

Bet In this article Joe Drape writes In Nevada more bets are placed on the Super Bowl than any other sporting event Last year for example a record of nearly 99 million was bet in Nevadas sports books Of that the books kept 7206460While even the best quarterbacks fumble and the seemingly invincible teams find ways to lose the sports books nearly always wind up ahead Who decides the numbers and proposition bets for big games like the Super Bowl and how do they do it Why do the sports books nearly always end up ahead What is square money and why is it that the flood of square money that inundates the Super Bowl makes the game one of the easiest lines of the year for oddsmakers Why in a world where algorithms rule and quants are celebrated does putting out a number remain an oldschool

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/01/21/us/ap-us-supreme-court-anonymous-tips.html,There were no sound effects and certainly no cameras on hand when Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia turned an already entertaining argument over a traffic stop on a twolane road in northern California into drama worthy of HollywoodNot even information that a carload of terrorists heading to Los Angeles with an atomic bomb would be enough to justify police stopping the car if the tip came from an anonymous source Scalia suggested Tuesday using an extreme example to urge a lawyer for two suspects appealing their conviction to stand firmI want you to say Let the car go Byebye LA Scalia said drawing laughter from the audience as well as some colleaguesWhile the rest of Washington stayed home in the snow the Supreme Court was in session Tuesday and the justices had what for them seemed a rollicking good timeThe legal issue before the court is whether an anonymous tip about reckless driving is enough under the Fourth Amendment for police to pull over a car without an officers corroboration of dangerous drivingTwo brothers pleaded guilty to transporting marijuana after California Highway Patrol officers pulled over their silver Ford 150 pickup based on a report of reckless drivingThe officers did not observe erratic driving but acted after dispatchers received a 911 call saying the vehicle had run the caller off the road and identifying it by its model color and license plate A subsequent search revealed four large bags of marijuana The brothers argue in their appeal that the traffic stop violated their constitutional rights based on an earlier high court ruling that anonymous tips by themselves ordinarily are not sufficient for police to detain or search someoneThe justices often try to test the arguments of the lawyers before them by hypothesizing about extreme positions In this debate Chief Justice John Roberts came up with a tip about a girl being tossed in the trunk of a car and kidnapped Not enough lawyer Paul Kleven said on behalf of the brothersYou get an A for consistency Im not sure about common sense Justice Anthony Kennedy saidBut Scalia proved a stricter grader after Kleven hesitated to agree that the car with the nuclear weapon couldnt be stopped That may be a situation again where the court decides that he risk is so great Kleven began before Scalia cut inSo you see hes not consistent the justice saidLawyers for California and the Obama administration defending the traffic stop based on the anonymous tip said keeping the public safe from drunken drivers outweighs the intrusion of a traffic stop They said a tip about someone driving recklessly would be enough because reckless driving often follows having had too much to drinkBut Justice Sonia Sotomayor said people use the term reckless differently suggesting she might not accept the governments argumentSotomayor gave as an example her mother who doesnt like it when the justice tops 50 miles per hour behind the wheel She thinks that when Im going 51 Im speeding and reckless Sotomayor saidThe case Navarette v California 129490 will be decided by late June,2014-01-21T16:03:39Z,drugs
NYT,http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/morning-agenda-state-of-the-union-spotlights-economic-inequality/,In his State of the Union address before Congress on Tuesday night President Obama promised to do something about economic disparity in a year of action vowing to act alone if necessary While Mr Obama covered a broad swath of issues his message centered on income inequality Those at the top have never done better he said But average wages have barely budged Inequality has deepened Upward mobility has stalledHis moderate ambitions stood in contrast with his sweeping legislation of years past when he proposed stiff regulations on Wall Street This year Mr Obama proposed closing the economic gap by raising the minimum wage expanding the earnedincome tax credit for lowwage workers without children and creating a new retirement savings planWhile Mr Obama did not directly focus on Wall Streets problems he did vow to address the tax code He said he would work with the Treasury to create a new way for Americans to start their own retirement savings called MyRA which encourages folks to build a nest eggMyRA guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in And if this Congress wants to help work with me to fix an upsidedown tax code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save but does little or nothing for middleclass Americans offer every American access to an automatic IRA on the job so they can save at work just like everybody in this chamber canAnd since the most important investment many families make is their home send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations HEDGE FUNDS BET ON BANKS LEGAL SETTLEMENTS  Despite the hefty penalties banks have incurred for their role in shoddy mortgage practices before the financial crisis some hedge funds are betting that these legal settlements were not large enough Following this logic these hedge funds have purchased subprime mortgagebacked securities that they believe will rise in value if Wall Street banks pay out a lot more money to settle even harsher penalties Peter Eavis writes in DealBook Now these hedge funds have put the onus on themselves to go after the banks for larger settlementsMr Eavis writes If the more exacting lawsuits succeed and the banks have to plow money into the bonds the hedge funds stand to make a windfall And the bond prices could rise merely if investors anticipate legal success well before any settlement is ever reachedALIBABA SCRUTINY INTENSIFIES  As the Chinese Internet giant Alibaba moves toward an initial public offering any one of its decisions could send investors into a tizzy Consider for example Alibabas announcement last week that it was acquiring a 543 percent stake in Citic 21CNNot much is known about Citic 21CN  it does not even have an active website  except that it has been listed in Hong Kong since 1972 with its principal business in system integration and software development So why Steven M Davidoff asks in the Deal Professor column did Alibaba acquire this companyThere are a number of possible answers including that Alibabas investment in the company was a backdoor listing because Alibaba sees the Hong Kong Stock Exchange as having restrictive rules on voting rights for shares But whatever the reason Alibabas investment is fueling speculation that shows no sign of abatingMr Davidoff writes The scrutiny is only going to get worse for Alibaba as it heads toward a public listing Once Alibaba does go public it no longer has the luxury of being coy about its actions no matter how small Thats the price you pay for being in the limelight up among the technology giants of the worldAlibaba continued to be the focus of attention on Tuesday after Yahoo which owns a significant stake in the company released its fourthquarter earningsON THE AGENDA  The Federal Open Market

the founder and cochief investment officer of Pimco is on CNBC at 2 pmA LESSON ON JC PENNEYS POISON PILL  Though the retailer JC Penney has attracted considerable hedge fund attention as of late  William A Ackmans Pershing Square Capital Management David Teppers Appaloosa Management among others  many of these activist investors seem to have lost interest in the struggling company So JC Penneys announcement on Tuesday that it had set a new lower threshold for its poison pill has left people scratching their heads Steven M Davidoff writes in a Deal Professor columnThe immediate conclusion was that JC Penneys move was intended to prevent more activist investors from accumulating a large stake in the company But the retailers decision may have been driven more by tax rules which set limits on net operating losses if there is a transfer of ownership Of course the way this change is defined is broad but suffice it to say that the new poison pill threshold may have been set to prevent such an ownership change which ultimately could put the company at risk of losing its net operating losses But JC Penneys reasoning remains unclear because hedge funds have for the most part come and goneMr Davidoff writes Perhaps now that things have settled down  Mr Ackman has left and JC Penneys former chief executive has rejoined the company  the board felt that it was safe to just deal with this issue Or maybe the board felt that it wanted to protect management for a while to make sure it had time to turn around the companys fortunes  Contact melbournecoal  EmailSign up

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/01/24/us/ap-us-justin-bieber-career.html,LOS ANGELES   For more than a year Justin Bieber has had more tabloid hits than Billboard hits The singers music career has taken a backseat to his wild boy antics and a new arrest for a DUI charge marks a new low for the Grammynominated pop starBiebers arrest Thursday is another sign of the crazy lifestyle that has taken over the 19yearolds image  but a more serious one given the gravity of his alleged offenses Authorities say Bieber failed a field sobriety test early Thursday and he is facing driving under the influence charges after driving nearly twice the speed limit on a Miami Beach street Police said he also resisted the arrest and smelled of alcoholAfter he was charged some key industry watchers were hesitant to talk about the Canadianborn singers woes and what it would mean to his imploding careerBut rapper Macklemore 30 was sympathetic He said if he had become a mainstream musician when he was Biebers age people would also see his strugglesI think its challenging for anybody to have your life be a spectacle and to be challenged and critiqued and judged And its definitely hard if youve never had any normalcy in your adult life or in your teenage life said Macklemore who has struggled with substance abuse I think thats very challenging I think if I had blown up at 22 or 23 I think you would have seen me do some crazy stuff in publicThe new year kickedoff in dramatic fashion for Bieber Detectives searched his California home looking for surveillance footage that might serve as evidence that the singer was involved in an eggtossing vandalism case that caused thousands of dollars in damage to a neighbors home The investigation garnered more attention than his album release which happened just days earlierJournals was released in December and has had some success some singles have hit then Top 40 thanks to digital sales But its miles away from the phenomenal charttopping success he enjoyed when he debuted as a cherubfaced softvoiced teenager in 2009 Since his arrival onto the music scene hes released multiple platinum albums  five of which have debuted at No 1  and has clocked hit single after hit single from Baby to Boyfriend His fulllength 2010 debut My World 20 was nominated for two Grammy Awards including best pop vocal album and best new artist where his loss surprised manyBieber hasnt had that kind of success for a whileHis second 3D film Justin Biebers Believe flopped when it debuted in December and grossed just 31 million during its first three days around the Christmas holiday In comparison his 2011 film Justin Bieber Never Say Never grossed 124 million on its opening day and 295 million during its opening weekend Bieber has also lost edge onstage during his recent tour At a stop in New Jersey in August he was sluggish onstage and appeared to lip sync throughout the night He didnt dance as strongly as he has in the past and he seemed to be uninterested at times onstageHes remained in the headlines though  for all the wrong reasons Last year represented a litany of lows from clashing with a paparazzo to fainting at a show to being photographed smoking marijuana Some of his troubles have reached the bizarre German authorities charged him thousands of dollars after he abandoned a pet monkey that they seized from him for failing to have proper vaccination papers the singer had to apologize to Bill Clinton after cursing the former president and spraying his photo with cleaning fluid in a New York City restaurant kitchenBiebers manager Scooter Braun was being honored as part of Billboards Power 100 event in Los Angeles on Thursday but he didnt attend Instead he offered support to Bieber on Twitter telling the singer he loved himi will act in the manner of someone who truly cares that is all I have to say thanks for all those concerned Braun tweeted Been a long day Bottom line is we are defined by how we handle adversity Be there when it counts Love fully in good times and badIn an interview with The Associated Press last month Braun said his client had got a little bit into trouble when asked about the formerly squeaky clean singers woes  In the same interview Usher Biebers mentor said his troubles are part of his maturationThe beautiful part about it is that those that are invested in a long term story you understand that there are peaks and valleys in every persons life some the RB star said Unfortunately the reality is he has to live with a camera in front of him but what he chooses to do on or off camera is analyzed or scrutinized in some off wayAs a result of the charges Bieber could automatically lose his license for a year and he could face a fine up to 1000 and 50 hours of community service The ramifications for his career are less clear There have been plenty of music stars who have been entwined in far more serious legal trouble or scandal and have rebounded thanks to the power of a hit single andor an image makeoverWhile his fan base may be dwindling he still has key support from those in the music industryI dont know Justin and I dont know what hes involved in All I know is if drugs are involved and I hope they are not theyre lethal music mogul Clive Davis said in an interview Thursday after Biebers arrest Hes a young man with strong talent that has really found an audience so Im sure we wish him wellI guess he could just focus on his career most of all added Jennifer Hudson sitting next to Davis All we can do is wish him the best you know Hell find his way____AP Music

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/01/16/world/europe/ap-eu-netherlands-working-for-beer.html,AMSTERDAM   The men streaming in and out of a small clubhouse in east Amsterdam could almost be construction workers at the end of a hard day taking off their orange reflective vests and cracking jokes as they suck down a few Heinekens waiting for their paychecksBut its only noon the men are alcoholics and the beers themselves are the paycheckIn a pilot project that has drawn attention in the Netherlands and around the world the city has teamed up with a charity organization in hopes of improving the neighborhood and possibly improving life for the alcoholics Not by trying to get them to stop drinking but instead by offering to fund their habit outrightParticipants are given beer in exchange for light work collecting litter eating a decent meal and sticking to their scheduleFor a lot of politicians it was really difficult to accept So you are giving alcohol Amsterdam East district mayor Fatima Elatik said No I am giving people a sense of perspective even a sense of belonging A sense of feeling that they are OK and that we need them and that we validate them and we dont ostracize our people because these are people that live in our districtIn practice the men  two groups of 10  must show up at 9 am three days a week They start off with two beers work a morning shift eat lunch get two more beers and then do an afternoon shift before closing out with their last beer Sometimes theres a bonus beer Total daily pay package 19 euros 25 in a mix of beer tobacco a meal and ten euros cashParticipants say a lot of that cash also goes to beerTo understand how this all came to be it helps to know the background For years a group of around 50 rowdy aging alcoholics had plagued a park in east Amsterdam annoying other parkgoers with noise litter and occasional harassmentThe city had tried a number of hardhanded solutions including adding police patrols and temporarily banning alcohol in the park outright  including for family barbecues and picnics Elatik says the city was spending 1 million euros 13 million a year on various prevention treatment and policing programs to deal with the problem and nobody was satisfiedMeanwhile the small nonprofit Rainbow Group Foundation and its predecessors had been experimenting with ways to get help for alcoholics and drug addicts in the areaFloor van Bakkum of the Jellinek clinic one of the citys bestknown addiction treatment clinics said her organization has a very different approach to treating alcoholism She has a few reservations about the Rainbow program but approves of it in generalShe said a harm reduction approach makes sense only when there is no real hope of recovery for an alcoholicThe Rainbow group tries to make it as easy as possible for alcoholics to live their lives and that they make as little as possible nuisances to the environment they are living in she said I think it is good that they are doing thisAmsterdam has a storied history of pragmatic solutions to social problems  ideas that often seemed immoral at the time Prostitution now fully legal has been tolerated here since the 1600s when the city was a major port Authorities designated a Red Light District where sailors could look for sex Marijuana use has been tolerated since the 1970s when people realized street dealers were the main source of problems and authorities allowed weed instead to be sold in designated coffee shops while police looked the other way In the 1980s and 1990s health care charities distributed free clean needles for heroin addicts to prevent the spread of HIVThis time the idea was simply that troublemakers might consume less and cause less trouble if they could be lured away from their park benches with the promise of free booze Rainbow leader Gerrie Holterman said beer was the obvious choice because its easier to regulate consumption Rainbow still harbors the ambition to get alcoholics to stop drinking and move them back to mainstream society and sees the workforbeer program as a first stepI think now that we are only successful when we get them to drink less during the day and give them something to think about what they want to do with their lives Holterman said This is a start to go toward other projects and maybe another kind of jobShe conceded there has only been one individual so far who has moved from the program to regular life Numerous participants have found the rules too demanding and dropped out But she said nuisance in the park has been reduced neighbors are happy and theres a waiting list of candidates who want to participateElatik of the Labor party said she couldnt quantify the cost of the current program  its budget comes partly from donations to Rainbow partly from city funds  but its definitely less than 100000 euros 130000One critic of the project is politician Marianne Poot of the rival conservative VVD party In a position statement on her website she praised the idea of forcing the men  who are on welfare  to workBut then its not proper to give them an extra payment in addition she said This really gives a completely wrong signalThe men who participate are a lively bunch Many are obviously buzzed at midday and perhaps not highly effective at picking up trash but jovial Some say they arent alcoholics just heavy drinkersThe foreman of one group Fred Schiphorst takes his job seriously He wears a suit and tie under his reflective vest which he says gives him a feeling of dignity He says he is treated with more respect in the neighborhood But he admits his offthejob drinking is still up and downOne introspective program participant is Karel Slinger 50 He says frankly that his life hasnt been transformed by the program His alcoholism is not under control But he says on the whole things have changed for the betterYes of course in the park it is nice weather and you just drink a lot of beer he said of his old life Now you come here and you are occupied and you have something to do I cant just sit still I want something to do,2014-01-16T07:07:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/us/politics/a-national-strategy-funds-state-political-monopolies.html,By his third year as chairman of the Alabama Republican organization Mike Hubbard believed his party had just about everything it needed to win control of the State LegislatureHe had a plan an 88page playbook for the 2010 campaign with detailed districtbydistrict budgets and precise voter turnout targets He had candidates doctors lawyers and smallbusiness owners most of them political novices recruited with an eye toward the antiestablishment fervor roiling the countryWhat Mr Hubbard did not have was enough money Alabama law barred corporations deeppocketed natural allies for state Republicans from giving more than 500 to candidates and parties  a limit that did not apply to the states unionsSo began a nationwide quest for cash that would take Mr Hubbard plan in hand to the Republican Parties in states like Florida and Ohio to a wealthy Texan who was one of the countrys biggest Republican givers and to a Washington organization that would provide checks from dozens of outofstate corporations among them Exxon Mobil Google Facebook and AltriaExploiting a loophole in the state law and a network of political action committees in Alabama and Washington Mr Hubbard shuffled hundreds of thousands of outofstate dollars into the Republican organization in Alabama vastly outraising the state Democratic Party On Election Day Republicans won majorities in both the State Senate and House of Representatives for the first time since Reconstruction  and Alabama joined the rapidly growing fraternity of states where government is controlled by a single political party now the largest it has been in more than half a centuryAlabamas transformation was the product in part of a sophisticated political apparatus designed to channel political money from around the country into states where conditions were ripe for Republican takeover In 2010 the effort achieved striking success moving a dozen states to sole Republican control including presidential swing states like Ohio and PennsylvaniaIn 2012 a resurgent Democratic version  financed chiefly by labor unions and wealthy liberal donors rather than corporations  began to catch up spearheading Democratic takeovers in Minnesota and ColoradoTheir combined work has helped remake the nations political landscape Republicans or Democrats control both the legislature and the governors office in 36 states the most in 60 years Twentythree states are now solely controlled by Republicans and 13 solely by Democrats In two others  New York and Washington  one chamber is jointly controlledIn some states the shifts are largely organic the product of Latino immigration economic transformation and other demographic forces But elsewhere the strategic deployment of campaign cash has helped consultants and donors accelerate or arrest states natural drift toward one party or the other defying national election trends or voter registration advantagesPeople who want to see policies enacted and see things tried are moving their activity to the states and away from Washington said Ed Gillespie a longtime Republican strategist who has played a central role in efforts to swing state legislatures to Republican control There is a sense that you can get things doneTheir partys success has empowered Republican lawmakers in dozens of states to redraw legislative districts on both the state and federal levels potentially ensuring their partys control of the United States House of Representatives for the rest of the decadeBut those successes are also paving the way for what amounts to a vast realworld experiment in lawmaking At a time when Washington appears hopelessly divided and gridlocked elected officials in oneparty states have aggressively reshaped government policy whether legalizing samesex marriage and marijuana abolishing taxes and regulations or restricting guns or labor unionsTheir labors have propelled Democratic and Republicancontrolled states in starkly divergent directions California where the state capital is controlled entirely by Democrats has expanded the range of nonphysicians who can perform surgical abortions while states held by Republicans like Texas Oklahoma and Kansas passed new limitsIn Connecticut dominated by Democrats lawmakers approved legislation that for the first time allowed citizens to register on Election Day to vote But in North Carolina Republicans who control state government for the first time in more than a century have outlawed sameday registration and passed some of the most stringent voter identification rules in the countryColorado held by Democrats has limited magazines in weapons to 15 rounds and required background checks for private gun sales while Kansas where Republicans enjoy legislative supermajorities passed a rule opening most city and county buildings to people carrying weaponsInterviews with more than 50 donors strategists and elected officials involved with those efforts along with a review of thousands of pages of public records revealed how the Democratic and Republican state machines share an array of strategies and goalsBoth sides rely on interlocking networks of political action committees party organizations and nonprofit groups often based in states with forgiving campaign finance rules that work in concert to raise contributions and shuffle money to thousands of local races around the country In some states liberal or conservative donors have established political nonprofits that function like shadow parties often exempt from the contribution limits or disclosure requirements that apply to candidates and traditional partiesNot unlike a political version of Cayman Islands banks the networks allow political strategists to sidestep regulations and obscure the source of funds Campaign contributions that would be banned or restricted in one state can be sent to a state where the rules allow money to flow more freely often scrubbed of the identity of the original donor Some groups work behind the scenes to orchestrate money bombs of smaller contributions from hundreds of different donors allowing the groups to provide candidates with large doses of cash  fingerprintfree  even in states with low contribution limitsBoth networks arose to help Democrats and Republicans skirt the McCainFeingold campaignfinance law which sharply cut the flow of money from national parties to the states But over the last three years they have been turbocharged by the Supreme Courts Citizens United decision which made it easier in many states for unions corporations and the wealthy to pool money for large independent expendituresToday state and even local races increasingly are financed by checks written hundreds or thousands of miles away A fivefigure contribution from a Colorado energy executive passes through a bank account registered in Pennsylvania where it is mixed with money that ends up in the campaign coffers of an attorney general candidate in Iowa Business money raised in Michigan where corporate contributions to candidates are banned fuels campaigns in Florida and Maine where such contributions are legalMuch of the money passes through a handful of Washingtonbased organizations From 2006 to 2010 the volume of campaign cash flowing from Beltwaybased groups to state parties and candidates almost doubled to 139 million from 79 million according to an analysis by The New York Times of data collected by the National Institute on Money in State PoliticsThat figure is widely expected to grow in this years midterm elections Strategists say donors are persuaded that dollars spent in relatively lowbudget state elections can go further in advancing their agenda than money burned in the ceaseless trench warfare of WashingtonThe donors are saying theres nothing going to happen in Washington anytime soon said Robert McKay chairman of the Democracy Alliance an elite club of liberal donors around the country that has been closely involved in efforts to move swing states into the Democratic column But conversely progressive ideas can be hampered  or be promoted  at the state levelA Rare OpportunityIn early 2010 a littleknown group called the Republican State Leadership Committee approached Mr Gillespie the party strategistOnce part of the Republican National Committee the group was forced by McCainFeingold to reorganize as an independent organization and had built up a respectable record of electing Republican state officials But with furor growing over President Obamas health care law officials at the leadership committee believed they had a rare opportunity to topple Democratic majorities around the countryMr Gillespie had a sterling rsum in Republican politics with stints as head of the Republican National Committee and as chairman of the Virginia Republican Party He was also a founder of one of Washingtons top lobbying firms with an enviable Rolodex and deep ties to the Beltways trade associationsMr Gillespie came on as chairman and chief rainmaker Armed with PowerPoint slides showing long lists of likely pickup opportunities he took his pitch to Wall Street investors in New York energy executives in Dallas and dozens of corporate government relations offices in WashingtonRepublicans could do more than just flip a few state legislatures he told them They could use their new statehouse majorities to build a firewall in the United States House of Representatives congressional districts so favorably drawn for Republicans that the partys House majority would endure for a decadeIt was three yards and a cloud of dust Mr Gillespie said of his hunt for dollars It was a constant working and working and working until it broke through Mr Gillespie is now talking about making his own bid for elected office a run for the United States Senate in VirginiaThe groups fundraising shot upward bolstered by bigger contributions from longtime donors  such as tobacco pharmaceutical and telecommunications interests  and new money from the growing network of postCitizens United conservative political groups By Election Day the leadership committee would raise 30 million its biggest twoyear haul everThe bulk of that money went into a carefully laid assault on Democratic lawmakers in 19 states planned in tandem with efforts by the Republican Governors Association In some states the groups handed cash directly to state parties or candidates Elsewhere they spent millions on hardtotrack radio and television advertisementsThe leadership committees nationwide base of donors lent candidates distance from the source of the money benefiting them and allowed the committee to maneuver around varying rules that apply to campaign spending in different states Instead of spending money where it was raised the Republican State Leadership Committee could allocate checks to affiliates in other states Other checks could be pooled into a central fund in Washington and then distributed in large chunks to state Republican Parties to candidates or to campaigns by independent groupsAlabama was an obvious target Long after its voters had become overwhelmingly Republican Alabama retained Democratic majorities in the Legislature Mr Hubbard himself a state representative and officials at the leadership committee believed just one wellorganized push would send the Democrats into permanent minority statusYet state law prohibited corporations from giving more than 500 And other potential donors were unwilling to give to the party at all in case the takeover effort failed There were a lot of people and companies who didnt want to give to us directly because they feared the Democrats Mr Hubbard saidMany of those donors were willing however to give to a Republican group in Washington After meeting with leadership committee officials Mr Hubbard along with his finance chairman State Senator Del Marsh began raising money for the group If they did well enough Mr Hubbard believed the leadership committee would make a similar investment in AlabamaWe had to become players for them said Mr Hubbard Their job is to flip legislatures and we wanted them to help us flip AlabamaDuring the 2010 cycle the leadership committee took in close to a million dollars from Alabama donors And over the same period the group directed about 14 million into an Alabamaregistered political action committee all of it from outofstate corporations Because the state allowed unlimited transfers between political action committees and parties  a loophole long exploited by Democrats and Republicans alike  the leadership committee could shuffle all of that money to the state party and a pair of committees controlled by Mr Hubbard and his teamThe arrangement also offered donors a way to help Mr Hubbard without their checks showing up on the Alabama partys public filings One such supporter was the Poarch Band of Creek Indians which operates several large casinos on tribal land in AlabamaThe tribe was wary of the rapid expansion of nonIndian gambling in the state particularly the proliferation of small bingo parlors competing with their resort casinos and stood to benefit if antigambling Republicans took control of the Legislature But precisely because they opposed gambling few Republican state lawmakers or candidates would accept the tribes contributionsAfter meeting with Mr Marsh and other Republicans said Robert R McGhee director of government affairs for the tribe the tribe chose a different approach It donated 350000 to the leadership committee When the contributions were later disclosed critics accused Mr Hubbard of using the Washington group to launder the money by exchanging it with other contributionsA spokesman for the leadership committee said that the Poarch Creek contributions had been allocated to the groups administrative account to pay for overhead and other expenses and that the staff members involved in arranging the checks no longer worked at the organization Mr Hubbard said there had been no agreement to directly swap cashThe conversation was Ive got some people in Alabama who are very interested in giving money to help elect Republicans to state legislatures and I would hope that if we help raise money for you you will help us win in Alabama Mr Hubbard saidSwap or no swap public records suggest that many of the contributions the leadership committee raised in Alabama made their way to races in other statesAbout 260000 from Alabama donors for example was assigned to a Pennsylvania account originally set up to collect checks from federal political action committees Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states that allow such contributions to be spent directly on state races But none of the money raised was spent in Pennsylvania Instead the Alabama contributions were pooled with hundreds of thousands of dollars in political action committee checks and individual contributions from around the country Beginning in August 2010 the leadership committee transferred 860000 from the Pennsylvania account to the Republican Party in Iowa to assist its candidatesThe Republican Governors Association made similar transfers In Michigan for example a political action committee set up by the governors association raised 84 million Virtually all of it came from a roster of elite donors outside Michigan such as Bob Perry the Texas homebuilder and David Koch the billionaire industrialist Most of that money was transferred to the Michigan Republican PartyWhile outofstate donors were funneling millions of dollars into Michigan Republicans were sending millions of dollars back out to the governors association in Washington All told Michigan donors contributed 85 million to the association That is roughly as much as the group spent on independent advertisements to help elect the Republican candidate for governor Rick Snyder on top of the money transferred directly for the Michigan partyRich Robinson the head of the Michigan Campaign Finance Network a watchdog group said he believed the transactions were designed in part to allow Michigan businesses which could not give directly to Mr Snyder to exchange their contributions for money from outofstate individual donors who could legally donate It appeared to be a currency swap to obfuscate the actual sources of money Mr Robinson said I had never seen anything like this before particularly at this scaleMore than 5 million of the Michigan money raised by the governors association for example was a corporate money from the Michigan Chamber of Commerce Two million dollars of that went to association affiliates in Maine and Florida where corporate contributions are legalA spokesman for the governors association Jon Thompson said that all of its contributions had been disclosed in campaign filings and that the association made sure its transfer stayed within each states restrictions on the size and source of contributions The RGA raises funds to elect and support Republican governors Mr Thompson said and we invest that money in full compliance of the law wherever we see any opportunity to make a difference in accomplishing our objectiveOnly when the dust from the 2010 elections settled did the full scale of the Republicans success become clearThe governors association spent 99 million and ended with Republican control of 29 governorships up from 23 the highest number for either party in a decade Republicans controlled 25 legislatures around the country up from 14 including in pivotal swing states such as North Carolina Wisconsin Ohio and Pennsylvania In Alabama Republicans won supermajorities in both houses of the Legislature Mr Hubbards colleagues elected him speaker of the Assembly while Mr Marsh became Senate leaderThe Alabama Republican Partys finances during that period have since come under scrutiny Some of the partys records have been subpoenaed by the Alabama attorney general Luther Strange a Republican though the scope of his offices inquiry is unclear and Mr Hubbard has denied any wrongdoingBut the impact of Republican governance in Alabama has been undeniable In the partys first year in control the Legislature passed  and the governor signed  more than 30 major pieces of legislation including new tax breaks for businesses ethics overhauls and restrictions on abortion and union organizingThe GayRights BattleIn May 2012 a former congressional aide named Kirk Fordham stood at the front of a packed ballroom in the basement of the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Washington a few blocks from the Jefferson Memorial Before him sat more than a hundred of the countrys leading gay donors and advocates all of whom had pledged to keep the proceedings confidentialIt was the third day of an annual conference known as OutGiving organized by the Gill Action Fund a Denverbased group and Mr Fordham the groups executive director was clicking through a presentation known as punishing the wicked As the donors watched Mr Fordham scrolled through names pictures and in some cases videos of state lawmakers and other elected officials each one an opponent of gayrights legislation All would be targeted for defeatFounded by a pressshy software entrepreneur named Tim Gill the fund had racked up a string of wins in state races helping elect dozens of lawmakers who supported gay rights  or unseating their opponents  in Iowa Colorado and New York In 2012 Mr Fordhams presentation showed Minnesota was rich with potential targetsTwo years earlier Republicans had won an upset victory there taking control of the State Senate and the State House for the first time in nearly four decades The new Republican majorities had sought to enact a wave of conservative or probusiness policies battling with the new Democratic governor Mark Dayton over tax cuts education spending and a measure to rein in unionsOne bill in particular had the Gill Action Funds attention Minnesota already had a law on the books banning samesex marriage But over Mr Daytons objections Republican lawmakers had put a question on the November ballot asking voters to enshrine that ban in the State Constitution making it less vulnerable to repealOther deeppocketed gayrights groups both in Minnesota and around the country were already mobilizing to defeat the marriage initiative The Gill group had a complementary goal helping Democrats win back the Legislature so that Republicans would not get a second chanceBy the spring of 2012 two strategists for the group had already spent weeks in Minnesota traveling to swing legislative districts sorting through turnout data and gauging the quality of the candidates Democrats were recruiting But the state has some of the lowest donation limits in the country A candidate for State Assembly could accept only up to 500 from individuals unions or political action committeesSo instead of cutting a few big checks the fund picked a handful of candidates and then organized a blizzard of small contributions to them from dozens of donors As Election Day neared outofstate contributions began to flow into the campaign accounts of seven Democratic candidates for the Minnesota Legislature The checks came from Philadelphia from Los Angeles and San Francisco from New York City and the Hudson Valley  at least 200 contributions in all from at least 50 donors around the country each one at or under the states limitKevin Dahle a Democratic candidate for Senate facing an uphill campaign in a mostly rural part of Minnesota raised almost a fifth of his campaign chest from outofstate gayrights supporters Paul Rosenthal running in a House district in suburban Minneapolis received about a quarter of his contributions from the same list of donorsWhile Mr Gills team organized contributions directly to candidates it was also joining up with one of the most successful statebased political operations anywhere in the country a liberal nonprofit group called the Alliance for a Better MinnesotaTwo years earlier the alliance had played a pivotal role in helping make Mr Dayton governor in part by persuading an array of outside interests  unions abortionrights supporters and environmental groups  to pool money and coordinate their political spendingA handful of big instate donors anchored the alliances fundraising led by Minnesota labor unions and Alida Messinger a wealthy philanthropist and Rockefeller heiress formerly married to Mr Dayton The commitments by instate donors and the prospect of giving Democrats control of state government in turn helped draw outofstate money for 2012 While the state Democratic Party paid for direct mail and radio ads the alliance organized a major campaign of television and Internet advertisingBecause the Alliance for a Better Minnesota is a nonprofit organization not a campaign committee it is not required to disclose a full roster of its donors But state law requires the group to disclose sources of funding for its political spending providing a glimpse of how the 2012 effort was financedMs Messinger contributed a total of 13 million both directly and through two other fundraising committees set up to manage donations An additional 937000  about a quarter of the total raised  came from outofstate donors among them the National Education Association the teachers union and a Washingtonbased organization called America Votes Three donors affiliated with the Gill Fund provided 90000The fund and other national gayrights groups also raised millions of dollars from out of state for efforts to defeat the antigaymarriage initiative Separately another Washingtonbased group the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee contributed 400000 to help finance a joint polling and research effort for the alliance and the Democratic Party The committee which raises money from unions wealthy individuals and corporations to help elect Democratic state lawmakers also contributed 700000 directly to the state party to help elect legislative candidates making it one of the partys largest donorsBy Election Day Democratic candidates and committees had amassed a nearly unprecedented cash advantage over the Republicans The alliance poured an additional 25 million in advertising into 32 races Democrats won all but six picking up majorities in both chambers of the LegislatureIn May 2013 Minnesota became the 12th state to legalize samesex marriage The Gill Fund is now raising money for incumbent lawmakers who voted for the measure an official there saidNo Republican or Democratic lawmaker from any state red or blue needs to question whether or not we will have their back when they do the right thing Mr Gill said in a statement We willLooking for TargetsThe blossoming interest of donors has fueled what both sides describe as an arms race Liberal and conservative groups are now moving quickly to identify and set up shop in states where demographic shifts and hotbutton policy disputes are opening up opportunities to radically reshape state governmentThey have been propelled in part by the vivid successes of their opponents North Carolina a state won by Mr Obama in 2008 has since become one of the countrys foremost laboratories of aggressive conservative policy makingIn Colorado a state where voters outlawed samesex marriage a halfdecade ago and Republican voters outnumber Democrats Democrats swept to full control of state government in 2012 Over the last year they have enacted sweeping changes on gun control marijuana legalization and civil unions Some of the legislation has provoked a fierce reaction from voters Two Democratic state senators who supported the guncontrol bill were ousted in recall elections in September while a third recently resigned to avoid being forced into a recall voteTheres undoubtedly more interest in whats happening in the states right now said Michael Sargeant executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee which raised significantly more money in 2012 than in any previous cycle since its founding There is less of a kneejerk need among some donors that their contributions need to stay in their stateThis year Republicans are targeting states like West Virginia The state has long been reliably Democratic but disputes over the regulation of coal mining and environmental rules have alienated important Democratic constituencies providing what Republicans believe is a clear chance to flip the state Republican over the next few election cyclesCharles and David Koch brothers whose philanthropic and political network has helped fuel a Republican resurgence in the onetime union strongholds of the industrial Midwest have also stepped up their political activity in the states they hope to rebound in places like Virginia where a Democrat won the governorship in 2013 and consolidate earlier victories in states like Michigan and WisconsinLiberal donors are following suit focusing on states like Arizona where Latino immigration has expanded the pool of potential Democratic voters Last spring the Democracy Alliance began a 10 million State Initiatives Fund aimed at building liberal organizations and winning back legislative seats in 12 states including North Carolina and Florida In Maine a consortium of progressive groups financed by the hedge fund billionaire S Donald Sussman an alliance member is looking to unseat Gov Paul R LePage this year and put both the governors office and the Legislature under Democratic controlIn a measure of their ambition liberal groups are even targeting some states in the Old South convinced that superior organization and money can help them begin to win back governorships and legislative seats Interest has focused on Georgia which has experienced significant Latino immigration and where 600000 votingage AfricanAmericans are not yet registered to voteLast year there were fewer Democrats on the ballot in Georgia than in any year on record according to Bryan Long the founder of Better Georgia a liberal group In recent months Mr Long  inspired by states like Minnesota  has circulated proposals to labor leaders and to donors in Georgia and around the country to build a 5 million political infrastructure for nonprofit groups outside the traditional party organizationWeve seen huge wins in other states Mr Long said And here in Georgia weve learned whats possible If you fight back you win And if you fight smart you win more,2014-01-12T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/magazine/a-speck-in-the-sea.html,Looking backJohn Aldridge knew it was a stupid move When youre alone on the deck of a lobster boat in the middle of the night 40 miles off the tip of Long Island you dont take chances But he had work to do He needed to start pumping water into the Anna Marys holding tanks to chill so that when he and his partner Anthony Sosinski reached their first string of traps a few miles farther south the water would be cold enough to keep the lobsters alive for the return trip In order to get to the tanks he had to open a metal hatch on the deck And the hatch was covered by two 35gallon Coleman coolers giant plastic insulated ice chests that he and Sosinski filled before leaving the dock in Montauk harbor seven hours earlier The coolers full weighed about 200 pounds and the only way for Aldridge to move them alone was to snag a box hook onto the plastic handle of the bottom one brace his legs lean back and pull with all his mightAnd then the handle snappedSuddenly Aldridge was flying backward tumbling across the deck toward the back of the boat which was wide open just a flat slick ramp leading straight into the black ocean a few inches below Aldridge grabbed for the side of the boat as it went past his fingertips missing it by inches The water hit him like a slap He went under took in a mouthful of Atlantic Ocean and then surfaced sputtering He yelled as loud as he could hoping to wake Sosinski who was asleep on a bunk below the front deck But the diesel engine was too loud and the Anna Mary on autopilot moving due south at six and a half knots was already out of reach its navigation lights receding into the night Aldridge shouted once more panic rising in his throat and then silence descended He was alone in the darkness A single thought gripped his mind This is how Im going to dieAldridge was 45 a fisherman for almost two decades Most commercial fishermen in Montauk were born to the work the sons and sometimes the grandsons of Montauk fishermen But Aldridge was different  he chose fishing in his mid20s moving east on Long Island from the suburban sprawl where he grew up to be closer to something that felt real to him He found work on a dragger and then on a lobster boat and then in 2006 he bought the Anna Mary with Sosinski his best friend since grade school Now they had a thriving business 800 traps sitting on the bottom of the Atlantic and two times a week theyd take the boat out overnight spend an 18hour day hauling in their catch and return the next morning to Montauk loaded down with lobster and crabSosinski had a reputation on the docks as a funloving loudmouth a bit of a clown  he actually rode a unicycle  but Aldridge was the opposite quiet intense determined Work on the Anna Mary was physically demanding and Aldridge who was lean but strong drew a sense of accomplishment even pride in how much he was able to endure each trip  how long he could keep working without sleep how many heavy traps he pulled out of the water how quickly and precisely he and Sosinski were able to unload them restock them with bait and toss them back in Now alone in the water he tried to use that strength to push down the fear that was threatening to overtake him No negative thoughts he told himself Stay positive Stay strongThe first thing youre supposed to do if youre a fisherman and you fall in the ocean is to kick off your boots Theyre dead weight that will pull you down But as Aldridge treaded water he realized that his boots were not pulling him down in fact they were lifting him up weirdly elevating his feet and tipping him backward Aldridges boots were an oddity among the members of Montauks commercial fishing fleet thick green rubber monstrosities that were guaranteed to keep your feet warm down to minus 58 degrees Fahrenheit a temperature Montauk had not experienced since the ice age Sosinski made fun of the boots but Aldridge liked them they were comfortable and sturdy and easy to slip on and off And now as he bobbed in the Atlantic he had an idea of how they might save his lifeTreading water awkwardly Aldridge reached down and pulled off his left boot Straining he turned it upside down raised it up until it cleared the waves then plunged it back into the water trapping a bootsize bubble of air inside He tucked the inverted boot under his left armpit Then he did the same thing with the right boot It worked they were like twin pontoons and treading water with his feet alone was now enough to keep him stable and afloatThe boots gave Aldridge a chance to think He wasnt going to sink  not right away anyway But he was still in a very bad situation He tried to take stock It was about 330 am on July 24 a clear starry night lit by a full moon The wind was calm but there was a fivefoot swell a remnant of a storm that blew through a couple of days earlier The North Atlantic water was chilly  72 degrees  but bearable for now Dawn was still two hours away Aldridge set a goal the first of many he would assign himself that day Just stay afloat till sunriseOnce the sun came up Aldridge knew someone was bound to start searching for him and he could begin to look for something bigger and more stable to hold on to For now though there was nothing to do but scan the horizon for daylight and watch the water for predators For the first hour the sea life mostly left him alone But then in the moonlight he saw two shark fins circling him less than 10 feet away  blue sharks they looked like 350 pounds or so Aldridge pulled his buck knife out of his pocket snapped it open and gripped it tightly ready to slash or stab if the sharks tried to attack Eventually though they swam away and Aldridge was alone again rising and falling with the oceans swell He kept trying to drive away those negative thoughts but he couldnt help it Who would get his apartment if he didnt make it back Who would take care of his dog He thought about fisherman friends who died funerals hed been to at St Therese the Catholic church in Montauk He thought about who would come to his own funeral if he didnt make itBut mostly he thought about his family back in Oakdale the Long Island town where he grew up his parents who had been married for almost 50 years and still lived in the house where Aldridge was born his brother his sister his little nephew Jake It was a closeknit middleclass ItalianandIrish family His father was retired from the Oldsmobile dealership in Queens where he commuted to work for decades Aldridge pictured them all asleep in their beds and thought about the phone calls they would soon be gettingHis family didnt bring it up much anymore but Aldridge knew that none of them liked the fact that he had taken up such a dangerous profession In his 20s when he was starting out as a fisherman his parents were constantly trying to talk him out of it They gave up eventually but even now every time he said goodbye to his mother she looked at him as if it were the last time she was going to see himAlone in the darkness he remembered a conversation he had a few months earlier with his sister over beers in her backyard They were talking about a friend of Aldridges named Wallace Gray a fisherman who drowned off Cape Cod when his scallop boat sank in bad weather It wasnt a very cheerful conversation and they both knew that they werent talking only about Gray Out of nowhere Aldridge felt compelled to make his sister a promise If I ever get into trouble out there he told her just know that Im going to do everything I can to get back homeIt was a little after 6 am when Anthony Sosinski woke up onboard the Anna Mary The mate he and Aldridge hired to work this particular trip an old friend named Mike Migliaccio got up first and when he saw that Aldridge was missing he yelled for Sosinski They were both sleepdazed confused by the daylight What time was it Where were they Sosinski tried to puzzle it out Just before he went to sleep at 9 pm he told Aldridge to wake him at 1130 pm Now it was past dawn Even if Aldridge had decided to let him sleep as he sometimes did surely he would have woken Sosinski by the time they got to their first trawl But they were more than 15 miles past their traps  almost 60 miles offshore What could have happenedThe Anna Mary is a 45foot boat and most of its surface is taken up by a flat open deck so there arent that many places to search for a missing person Still Sosinski and Migliaccio looked everywhere One hatch cover on the deck was off and Sosinski thought maybe Aldridge had fallen into the open lobster tank hit his head and drowned He lay facedown on the deck and stuck his head through the hatch ignoring the powerful smell No sign of AldridgeSosinski ran to the VHF radio which was bolted to the ceiling in the small wheelhouse toward the front of the boat and grabbed the microphone He switched to channel 16 the distress channel and at 622 am he called for help his voice shaking Coast Guard this is the Anna Mary Weve got a man overboardThe Coast Guards headquarters for Long Island and coastal Connecticut is in New Haven Sean Davis is a petty officer there and it was his job that morning to stand watch at the stations communications unit Davis was part of a fiveperson watch that had just come on duty Davis radioed back asking Sosinski for details and Sosinski started feeding them to him when he last saw Aldridge the course the boat was on where they were now No Aldridge wasnt wearing a life preserver No he wasnt wearing a GPS distress beacon No he didnt leave a note Yes he could swimDavis asked Sosinski to stand by and he turned to the rest of the team in the command center a dimly lit room on the second floor of the base The front wall was covered with maps and charts and video screens which could show everything from a live radar image of Long Island Sound to the local news Sitting nearest to Davis was Pete Winters a Coast Guard veteran who was now working as a civilian searchandrescue controller That morning he was the Operations Unit watch stander which would normally mean that hed be the person running the searchandrescue computers On this morning though there was a second person in the Operations Unit Jason Rodocker a petty officer who that week was breaking in or being trained Rodocker was new to Long Island Sound  he had just transferred two days earlier from the Coast Guard station in Baltimore But as it happened he was an expert in the Coast Guards searchandrescue computer program known as SaropsThe first calculation the search team ran that morning was a survival simulation taking into account Aldridges height 59 and weight 150 pounds plus the weather and water temperature It told them that the longest Aldridge could likely stay afloat before hypothermia took over and his muscles gave out was 19 hours But that they knew was a best case The reality was that very few people survived more than three or four hours in the North Atlantic especially without a flotation deviceBy 628 the command center had notified the search mission commander in New Haven Jonathan Theel and the search coordinator at the district headquarters in Boston who would have to approve the use of any aircraft in the search At 630 Davis issued a universal distress call on channel 16 Pan pan Pan pan Pan pan he intoned the international maritime code for an urgent broadcast This is United States Coast Guard Sector Long Island Sound The Coast Guard has received a report of a man overboard off the fishing vessel Anna Mary south of Montauk between 5 and 60 miles offshore All mariners are requested to keep a sharp lookoutDavis kept working the radio He contacted the Coast Guard station in Montauk with instructions to launch whatever boats were available Boston approved the use of two helicopters and a search plane and Davis radioed Air Station Cape Cod and told them to get airborne as soon as possible The closest Coast Guard cutter an 87footer called the Sailfish was in New York Harbor and Davis directed its crew to start heading eastRodocker meanwhile was manning the computer The Coast Guard has used computer simulations in search and rescue since the mid1970s but Sarops has been in use since only 2007 At its heart is a Monte Carlostyle simulator that can generate in just a few minutes as many as 10000 points to represent how far and in what direction a search object might have drifted Operators input a variety of data from the last known location of a lost mariner to the ocean currents and wind direction Sarops then creates a map of a search area  in this case of the ocean south of Montauk  with colored squares representing each potential location for the search object Red and orange squares represent the most likely locations gray squares represent the least likelyThe challenge in Aldridges case was that the search team had no clear idea when  and therefore where  he fell overboard It might have been five minutes after Sosinski went to sleep or it might have been five minutes before he woke up That created a potential search area the size of Rhode Island a sweep of ocean 30 miles wide starting at the Montauk lighthouse and extending 60 miles south This was a big problem In contrast to the sophisticated algorithms of Sarops the Coast Guards basic searching technique is a lowtech one  human beings staring at the ocean looking for a persons head bobbing in the waves An 1800squaremile search area would be almost impossible to coverThe team in New Haven based its initial calculations on Sosinskis report that Aldridge was supposed to wake him up at 1130 pm That suggested to them that Aldridge fell overboard between 930 pm and 1130 pm which would put him somewhere between five and 20 miles south of the Long Island coast Rodocker input those assumptions and Sarops came back with an Alpha Drift  its first scatter plot of search particles  that curved in a thick parabola from Montauk Point southward bulging out toward the east with the highestprobability locations the reddest squares on the map clustered about 15 miles offshoreThe next step for Sarops was to develop search patterns for each boat and aircraft dividing up the search area into squares and rectangles and assigning each vessel a zone to search and a pattern to use A little before 8 am New Haven started issuing patterns to the first three assets on the scene the plane a helicopter and a 47foot patrol boat from Montauk Sarops can assign all kinds of patterns depending on the conditions  a track line a creeping line an expanding square  but in this case each search crew was assigned whats called a parallel search a rectangular Sshaped pattern with long search tracks proceeding roughly north and south and a small jog to the west between each trackThe helicopter was a Sikorsky Jayhawk piloted by two young lieutenants from Air Station Cape Cod named Mike Deal and Ray Jamros Flying a Jayhawk in the Coast Guard like many jobs these days involves looking at a lot of screens seven in total spread out in front of Deal and Jamros in the cockpit showing live maps radar images and search patterns When the parallel pattern came in from New Haven the coordinates fed directly into the helicopters navigation system meaning that the pilots were able to simply turn on the autopilot and let the helicopter fly the search pattern on its own That allowed Deal and Jamros to turn their attention away from the screens and toward the water below them They were joined in their search by two crew members who sat in the back of the helicopter a rescue swimmer named Bob Hovey and a flight mechanic named Ethan Hill Deal and Jamros scanned the ocean through their cockpit windows Hill sat perched in the wideopen door on the right side of the helicopter where he had the clearest view of the water below Hovey spent most of his time staring at yet another screen this one displaying the output of an infrared radar camera mounted on the bottom of the helicopterThe Coast Guard search was off to an excellent start It was a clear day with good visibility and they had plenty of assets in place The only problem of course was that everyone involved was searching in entirely the wrong place Aldridge did not fall in the water at 1030 pm he fell in at 330 am Almost 30 miles south of where the Jayhawk crew was carefully searching for him Aldridge was clinging to his boots in the cold waterBack in New Haven Pete Winters was having second thoughts about the Alpha Drift He borrowed the microphone from Sean Davis and radioed the Anna Mary directly Talk to me Captain he said to Sosinski Fisherman to fisherman Help me reduce this search area We need to narrow it down so we can find JohnThroughout his long career with the Coast Guard Winters worked on the side as a commercial fisherman on the North Fork of Long Island like his grandfather and his uncle before him This gave him an advantage when a searchandrescue operation involved commercial fishermen especially Long Island fishermen He spoke their languageSosinski had also been having second thoughts about the search area After his initial conversation with Davis he inspected the boat more carefully and he found a few important clues One hatch cover was upside down on the deck which every mariner knows is bad luck  an upsidedown hatch cover means your boat is going to wind up upside down too Aldridge must have left it propped up against the side of the boat when he opened the hatch  and he wouldnt have left it there for long The pumps were on sluicing cool ocean water through the lobster tanks which meant that Aldridge had been preparing them for the days catch And in the warm summer months Aldridge and Sosinski would usually wait to start filling the tanks until their boat reached the 40fathom curve the line on maritime charts that marks where the oceans depth hits 40 fathoms or 240 feet which is the point at which the water temperature tends to drop The 40fathom curve is only about 15 miles north of the Anna Marys first trawl Then Sosinski found the broken handle on the ice chest and he realized exactly how Aldridge had fallen overboard It was still difficult for Sosinski to reconcile this new information with the fact that Aldridge hadnt woken him up at 1130 pm as scheduled but he knew that Aldridge liked to push himself and it didnt seem entirely uncharacteristic that his friend might have just decided to stay up all night alone before working an 18hour day pulling in trapsTogether Sosinski and Winters came up with a new theory Aldridge had gone overboard somewhere between the 40fathom curve about 25 miles offshore and the Anna Marys first trawl about 40 miles offshore At 830 am Winters passed this new information to Rodocker who punched it into Sarops When the new map emerged most of the darkred search particles had migrated south of the 40fathom curve and Sarops quickly developed a second more southerly set of search patternsTheel the searchmission commander in New Haven then turned his attention to a more difficult duty informing Aldridges parents He called John Aldridge Sr who called his wife to the phone and they sat together listening to Theel deliver the news of their sons disappearance Mrs Aldridge was hopeful but Mr Aldridge felt certain his son was already dead If he hadnt been killed by the propellers when he fell overboard he had surely drowned by now Pretty soon he thought Theel would be calling back to say that the helicopters had found Johns lifeless body floating in the waves or that the Coast Guard had decided to suspend the searchThe news about Aldridge was also spreading through Montauks fishing community Much of the towns commercial fleet was out on the water that morning Some fishermen heard Sosinskis anguished first call for help Others heard Sean Daviss panpan broadcast And then word traveled from boat to boat back to the dock and then all over Montauk The mood in town was grim Everyone knew the odds a man overboard that far off the coast would very likely never be found aliveMost of the fishermen who heard the news had the same immediate response wherever they were They wanted to help with the search Richard Etzel the captain of a Montauk charter boat had taken a group of customers out at dawn that morning to fish for striped bass When he heard the news over the radio he took his customers back in fueled up and headed south At the Montauk Marine Basin a mechanic borrowed a customers centerconsole boat  without actually mentioning it to the customer  and took off toward the fishing grounds Jimmy Buffett the singer who has a summer house in Montauk had that morning hired Paul Stern one of the best bigtuna fishermen on the East Coast to take him out in Buffetts boat the Last Mango When Stern heard about Aldridge he asked Buffett if they could join the search Buffett agreed and the Last Mango headed south as wellIn total 21 commercial boats volunteered to look for Aldridge And as they set out one by one they flipped their radios over to channel 16 and alerted the Coast Guard that they were joining the search Usually when good Samaritans volunteer to take part in a searchandrescue mission the Coast Guard politely declines Its too complicated the civilians dont know the search patterns and their searches arent always reliable In this case though the search area was so vast that the Coast Guard needed all the help it could get And these were highly motivated volunteers who knew the area well Theel didnt want to turn down that kind of help Still Sean Davis couldnt possibly coordinate 21 new search patterns on top of all the Coast Guard craft he was already directing So Winters hit on an idea They would put Anthony Sosinski in charge of the volunteer fishing fleetSosinski said yes to the assignment of course  he would have done anything to find Aldridge  but organizing 21 fishing boats into a search party would be a daunting task for anyone and Sosinski was distraught and disoriented standing alone in the cramped wheelhouse of the Anna Mary in his bare feet and shorts In contrast to the hightech work stations in New Haven Sosinskis only work surface was a chesthigh countertop by the boats front window that was always piled high with unopened mail newspaper clippings notebooks tide charts and rolls of paper towel and electrical tape Sosinski dug through the mess until he found a pen then got on the radio and asked the volunteer searchers to give him their latitude and longitudeTo outsiders Sosinski looked more like a surfer than a fisherman long sunbleached blond hair that he was constantly pushing back from his eyes untamed facial hair and a face tanned and creased by years in the sun On his days off he would usually smoke some marijuana to calm himself when he was in charge of the boats satellite radio he inevitably chose the 70s station He was short and muscular always humming with energy talkative jittery  all of which made for a sharp contrast with most Montauk fishermen who tended to be laconic and reserved But Sosinski had been on the dock since he was a teenager and he had earned a certain kind of respect  or at least affection  among the Montauk fishing fleetWhen Sosinski was growing up in Oakdale his father worked as a tractortrailer driver during the week delivering lumber up and down Long Island But most Friday nights his father would drive to Montauk for the weekend where hed work a second job as a deckhand for the Viking fleet Montauks biggest charter company helping out on halfday partyboat charters When Sosinski turned 12 he started tagging along on his fathers weekend trips and in high school Sosinski spent each summer living on a houseboat moored at the Montauk dock working full time for Viking As soon as he finished high school Sosinski moved to Montauk and started commercial fishing He married at 20 and by the time he was 24 he had two daughters and a job on a longline tilefish boat going out for 10 days at a timeThen Sosinski returned from a fishing trip to find that his wife had left town with their children No note no forwarding address For 14 months he searched for his family until he finally found them in Laguna Calif After a long legal battle Sosinski won custody of both of his daughters and brought them back to Montauk where he raised them as a single father doing everything from attending PTA meetings to cooking dinner to making sure they both got into college While the girls were young he worked close to shore on a small lobster boat so that he could be home every nightAldridge and Sosinski first fished together as boys riding their bikes to a spot they found under Sunrise Highway and pedaling home with their bicycle baskets filled with trout Once Aldridge joined Sosinski in Montauk they fished for years on separate boats but when a beatup lobster boat called the Anna Mary came up for sale they decided to pool their money and buy it together It took more than a year of repair work in the boatyard to make the Anna Mary seaworthy and the men were in their late 30s by the time they finally got it out on the water But it felt to both of them like the opportunity they had been waiting for  no boss working together setting their own hours charting their own courseThroughout the 1990s and early 2000s Montauks commercial fisheries had been contracting a casualty depending on whom you asked of rampant overfishing or excessive government regulation Every year there were fewer commercial boats going out But Sosinski and Aldridge made it work They found a buyer for their lobsters in Sayville who would ship them on the ferries to Fire Island They sold their crabs to Chinese markets in Queens They werent getting rich  maintaining lobster traps and a boat is an expensive undertaking  but they were doing all right And they were still fishing side by side more than 30 years after they first dropped their hooks in the waterNow quite literally Sosinski had lost his best friend All day as he stared out at the vast rolling ocean he felt helpless and guilty If only hed woken up a few hours earlier he told himself Aldridge would have taken his shift in the bunk and right now theyd be pulling in lobster traps together He tried to focus all his energy on directing the commercial boats in northsouth tracking lines trying to keep all their locations straight But none of it felt like enough Aldridge had left his drivers license in the wheelhouse propped up next to the radio and every once in a while during the search Sosinski would pick it up and hold it in his hand Hed stare at it and say out loud Where are you JohnThe sun rose on John Aldridge at about 530 on the morning of July 24 He was cold thirsty and tired  hed been awake for 24 hours  but he was still alive and afloat Now that it was light he gave himself a new assignment find a buoy To most people the Atlantic Ocean 40 miles south of Montauk is just a big undifferentiated expanse of waves but Aldridge knew roughly where he fell overboard  a few miles south of the 40fathom curve And he knew that several lobster fishermen had trawls nearby  he knew them by name in fact Each lobster trawl is a string of 30 to 50 traps spaced 150 feet apart at the bottom of the ocean and at the end of each string a rope extends up from the last trap to the surface where it is tied to a big round vinyl buoy If Aldridge could make his way to a buoy he figured he would be more visible to the searchers and it would be easier to stay afloatBut where to find one For the first couple of hours of daylight Aldridge just drifted and looked Every 10 seconds or so a swell would carry him up a few feet and when he got to the top of the wave hed scan the horizon for a buoy Finally at the peak of one wave he spotted a buoy a couple of hundred yards away and began swimming toward it He took a sock off one foot and stretched it over his right hand to give himself more pull But it was slow going with the boots under his arms and the current was against him Each time he looked up the buoy was a little farther awayAldridge realized he was exhausting himself and he decided to cut his losses He was able to see that the buoy he had been swimming toward had a flag on top of it which lobster fishermen attach to the west end of their strings Lobster traps are always laid out along an eastwest line so Aldridge figured that a mile or so to the east of the unreachable buoy he would find the other end of that string of traps and with it another buoy He started swimming east  with the current this time instead of against it  stopping briefly at the top of each swell to see if he could catch sight of the eastern buoy It was painful work His legs were cramping He couldnt feel his fingers The sun rising higher in front of him was blinding But finally after more than an hour he spotted a buoy and using the current he was able to angle himself directly into it He grabbed the rope and held onAfter a minute or two of relief Aldridge discovered that the buoy wasnt quite the deliverance he was hoping for Lobster buoys can be big  two feet or more in diameter  so it was impossible to get his arms around it or ride on top of it in any way His only option was to grab on to the black vinyl eye at the bottom of the buoy that the rope was threaded through The problem was since the buoy was tethered to the traps at the bottom of the ocean it didnt rise entirely with the waves Each time a swell rose much of the buoy would submerge Which meant that Aldridge would be dunked underwater as wellBy noon Aldridge had been in the water for almost nine hours He was starting to shiver uncontrollably Sea shrimp and sea lice were fastening themselves to his Tshirt and shorts claiming him as part of the sea Storm petrels swarmed around occasionally squawking and divingAldridge could see the plane and the helicopters running their patterns but everyone searching for him seemed to be at least a mile to the east Clinging to the buoy he realized that the Coast Guard thought he was still drifting Even if theyd figured out more or less where he fell in their search patterns hadnt taken into account the possibility that he snagged a buoy Aldridge knew if he wanted to have a chance of being found he had to get himself farther east He took out his buck knife and started chopping away at the rope that held the buoy in place When he got it free he tied it around his wrist and began swimming east again holding the buoy in front of himAs he went he felt the energy drain from his body His kicks and strokes were weakening The sun rose higher and the skin on his face and neck began to blister and burn Then at the top of one swell impossibly he spotted the Anna Mary less than a quartermile in front of him Mike Migliaccio was standing on the roof and Aldridge hollered with all the strength he could muster He tried to throw the buoy up in the air to attract attention but the boat was too far away For the second time that day Aldridge watched as the Anna Mary receded into the distance without him and he began to contemplate the reality hed kept at bay in his mind for all these hours that no matter what he did he might not be rescued after allHe willed himself to keep kicking until eventually  he doesnt know how much time went by  he reached another buoy He recognized that it belonged to his friend Pete Spong a Rhode Island fisherman who owned a lobster boat called the Brooke C He untied the rope from his wrist and tied it to the anchor rope underneath the new buoy Now he had two buoys connected by a few feet of rope He swung his leg over the rope and straddled it facing east The thick rope rubbed back and forth on his crotch and his legs as the waves rose and fell chafing them raw but at least he wasnt being pulled underwater anymore He repositioned the boots under his arms and he waited knowing that this was as far as he could go that he couldnt survive another swim If he was still in the water at sundown he decided he would tie himself to the Brooke Cs buoy That way at least someone would find his body and his parents would have something to buryUp in theJayhawk helicopter Deal and Jamros and Hovey and Hill had been staring at the water since about 7 am and by early afternoon they were growing discouraged They had a few false alarms during the day  sea turtles and mylar balloons  and with each possible sighting they followed the same protocol the person who saw the object would call out Mark Mark Mark One pilot would hit a button in the cockpit that would mark the location and they would swing the helicopter back around to check it out Each time nothingThe truth of working as a searchandrescue helicopter pilot for the Coast Guard is that you dont get to do a lot of actual rescuing Deal had been in the Coast Guard for eight years flying a Jayhawk for three and he had never once pulled anyone alive from the water They had all trained for it countless times plucked dummies out of the ocean run through checklists and drills until they had them memorized But the reality was that almost every time a person went overboard in the North Atlantic he drownedAt 219 pm the helicopter crew finished another parallel search pattern  their third of the day  and radioed to Sean Davis to request a new one They were about an hour from bingo fuel the moment at which they would have only enough gas to make it home And once they stopped to refuel they knew they would be in fatigue status and Coast Guard regulations would then stipulate that they couldnt take off again until the next day  at which point Aldridge would be well past his 19hour survivability windowDavis radioed back from New Haven with some unwelcome news Sarops had crashed The search had been going on so long and involved so many assets that the system became overloaded the screens in the command center simply froze After much shouting and cursing and pounding on keyboards Rodocker had to restart the system and now he was typing in all the relevant information again For the time being Sarops couldnt produce search patterns Davis instructed the Jayhawk crew to return to its base in Cape Cod  even if Rodocker was able to get Sarops running soon bingo fuel was fast approaching and there wouldnt be time for them to do a full search pattern anywayThey radioed back and argued with Davis They were out there anyway and they still had a little fuel  why not give them something to do The search unit in New Haven finally agreed and in the command center Rodocker Winters and the command duty officer a civilian named Mark Averill huddled around Rodockers computer and looked at the latest Sarops map Pointing with his finger on the screen Averill proposed a simple trackline search the Jayhawk would head southsoutheast for about 10 miles straight through the main search area then turn sharply to the north for another 10 miles then veer northnorthwest which would take the crew straight back to Air Station Cape Cod It wasnt a conventional pattern and it wasnt Saropsgenerated but it would have to do Davis radioed the coordinates to Deal and Jamros who fed them manually into their autopilot and at 246 pm the helicopter started moving againTwelve minutes later Ray Jamros called out Mark Mark Mark  only now he was much louder and more insistent than he had been all day Deal hit the mark button in the cockpit and turned the helicopter around And there was John Aldridge sitting on the rope between his two buoys clutching his boots and waving frantically Bob Hovey the rescue swimmer clipped his harness onto the helicopters hoist cable and Hill lowered him into the water As Hovey swam to Aldridge Hill lowered a rescue basket and Hovey helped Aldridge climb in Just as Hill was about to raise him up Aldridge realized that his boots were floating away and he yelled to Hovey to grab them and put them in the basket with himAfter Aldridge was safely in the helicopter huddled under blankets Deal flipped the radio to channel 21 and called Sosinski who was somewhere below them staring out at the water still looking for Aldridge Anna Mary Deal said we have your man Hes aliveTheres a bar in Montauk a few steps from the Anna Marys slip called the Dock a dark woodpaneled place with stuffed animal heads on the wall and signs that say things like No Shrimpers No Scallopers and Weve upped our standards Up yours It is one of the dwindling number of places in town that feels as if it belongs to the people who live and work there yearround If you step inside the Dock any given afternoon youll very likely find fishermen drinking and talking about ballgames and elections DUIs and divorces Youre very likely too to hear them talking sometimes overtly sometimes not about the loss of a way of life  the government regulations that make it harder to make a living as a commercial fisherman the vanishingly small margins for doing the dangerous work they do the way this place where theyve made their home is less recognizable to them with each passing yearIn the weeks after Aldridges rescue I talked to several local fishermen on the docks about the search and not only did they all admit that they cried when they heard the news that Aldridge was safe but most of them teared up again despite themselves as they were telling me the story It was hard to say what exactly was bringing them to tears But what seems to go mostly unspoken in their lives is the inescapable risk of their jobs and the improbable fact that Aldridge hadnt drowned in the Atlantic somehow underscored that risk for them even more Hed kept himself alive in a way that few people could had managed to think and work his way through a situation that for most of us would have been immediately and completely overwhelming And hed willed himself to live To be a fisherman and to really know the danger of the sea and to think of Aldridge in the middle of the ocean for all those hours refusing to go under  maybe that was too much to containThe person who seems least shaken by the experience is John Aldridge He spent the night after his rescue in a hospital in Cape Cod being treated for hypothermia dehydration and exposure but he has no posttraumatic stress he told me no nightmares no flashbacks no fear when he goes out on the water to work The Coast Guard pilots and the men in the search unit in New Haven express a certain understandable pride when they talk about their work that day and when Aldridge talks about it he sounds the same way I always felt like I was conditioning myself for that situation he told me one day in September while we were sitting in the Dock So once youre in it its like All right I can do that I did it I had that sense of accomplishment I mean thank God I was saved yes Thank God they saved me Theres no better entity than the US Coast Guard to come save your ass when youre on the water But I felt I did my partFor the people around him though things havent been quite so easy Aldridges father told me that he still often wakes up around 3 am and cant get back to sleep Its something that you cant kick he said Its never out of my mind Never A few weeks after his sons rescue John Sr got a tattoo on his arm a pair of big green fishing boots and between them the GPS coordinates where his son was foundAnthony Sosinski still seems shaken as well For all his happygolucky charm his love of life something changed for him on July 24 The last time he and I talked about it we were sitting in the wheelhouse of the Anna Mary which was tied up at the Town Dock More than anything I think about it when Im out there working he explained It was the whole feeling of helplessness Something was torn out of me and that part doesnt just show back upFor Montauk as a community the ocean remains a blessing and a curse It is the lifeblood of the town the essence of its economic livelihood the reason the tourists keep coming back But it is also a constant threat In September a 24yearold Montauk commercial fisherman named Donald Alversa was killed on a fishing trip on a dragger off the coast of North Carolina Alversa grew up in Montauk  he went to school with Sosinskis older daughter  and Sosinski and Aldridge attended his wakeThe funeral home was crowded and the mood was somber When it was over the Dock filled up and the mourners drank late into the night The next evening after Alversas funeral Sosinski and Aldridge met at the Anna Mary They loaded on bait and ice steered her past the lighthouse and went back to work,2014-01-05T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/04/tapping-medical-marijuanas-potential/,Marijuana has been used medically recreationally and spiritually for about 5000 years Known botanically as cannabis it has been called a crude drug marijuana contains more than 400 chemicals from 18 chemical families More than 2000 compounds are released when it is smoked and as with tobacco there are dangers in smoking itMedical marijuana clinics operate in 20 states and the District of Columbia and its recreational use is now legal in Colorado and Washington A Gallup poll conducted last month found that 58 percent of Americans support the legalization of marijuanaYet researchers have been able to do relatively little to test its most promising ingredients for biological activity safety and side effects The main reason is marijuanas classification by Congress in 1970 as an illegal Schedule I drug defined as having a potential for abuse and addiction and no medical valueAmerican scientists seeking clarification of marijuanas medical usefulness have long been stymied by this draconian classification usually reserved for street drugs like heroin with a high potential for abuseDr J Michael Bostwick a psychiatrist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minn said the classification was primarily political and ignored more than 40 years of scientific research which has shown that cellular receptors for marijuanas active ingredients are present throughout the body Natural substances called cannabinoids bind to them to influence a wide range of body processesIn a lengthy report entitled Blurred Boundaries The Therapeutics and Politics of Medical Marijuana published last year in Mayo Clinic Proceedings Dr Bostwick noted that the socalled endocannabinoid system has an impact on the autonomic nervous system immune system gastrointestinal tract reproductive system cardiovascular system and endocrine networkThere is evidence that several common disorders including epilepsy alcoholism and posttraumatic stress disorder involve disruptions in the endocannabinoid system suggesting that those patients might benefit from marijuana or its ingredientsThe strongest evidence for the health benefits of medical marijuana or its derivatives involves the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain and the spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis Medical marijuana is widely recognized as effective against nausea and appetite loss caused by chemotherapy although better treatments are now available But preliminary research and anecdotal reports have suggested that marijuana might be useful in treating a number of other conditions including irritable bowel syndrome Crohns disease glaucoma migraine cancer growth abnormal heart rhythms Alzheimers disease fibromyalgia incontinence bacterial infections osteoporosis intense itching Tourettes syndrome and sleep apneaMedical experts emphasize the need to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug to facilitate rigorous scientific evaluation of the potential therapeutic benefits of cannabinoids and to determine the optimal dose and delivery route for conditions in which efficacy is established Diane E Hoffmann and Ellen Weber legal experts at the University of Maryland wrote in The New England Journal of MedicineMarijuanas bestknown ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol or THC is responsible for the high sought by recreational users But many people who try smoking marijuana to relieve a health problem are distressed by its psychoactive effectsExperts believe that some people would do better with a derivative of marijuana that offers therapeutic action without the mindaltering baggage A more precise dose free of unwanted contaminants would be safer and its effects would be reproducibleWe believe that physicians should clearly explain to their patients that medical marijuana is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration and that it is not a standardized or purified product Dr Herbert D Kleber of Columbia University and Dr Robert L Dupont of Georgetown Medical School wrote last year in The American Journal of PsychiatryOne vocal proponent of a more scientific approach to medical marijuana is Martin A Lee the author of Smoke Signals and director of Project CBD an acronym for cannabidiol a compound in marijuana with high therapeutic potential but no psychoactive properties indeed it can neutralize the high caused by THCMr Lee said in an interview that medical marijuana clinics offer a hodgepodge of products including many strains of the plant with varying ratios of active ingredients While all clinics are in business to make money he said the more serious ones try to direct consumers to products that best suit their needsStill access to purified and welltested drugs derived from marijuana would be a far better approach One such drug Sativex is currently in Phase 3 trials in the United States for the relief of neuropathic pain It is a combination of CBD and THC in a ratio that minimizes the appetite stimulation drowsiness and anxiety induced by THC while magnifying painkilling and antitumor properties Mr Lee saidThe endocannabinoid system has two types of receptors CB1 and CB2 that

NYT,http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/04/casinos-pot-and-the-quest-for-consistency/,My Sunday column on pot and jackpots  that is the march toward marijuana legalization and the spread of casino gambling  tried to widen the usual culturewar frame to encompass not just bedroomandaltar hot buttons but the way the broader logic of consenting adults is working itself out in other areas of American life One point I didnt get to though is the extent to which both of these issues pot and gambling illustrate what one might call the rationalizing impulse in modern American politics which seeks perfect fairness and consistency at the expense of compromises rooted in the accidents of history and which makes it hard for conservatives to defend older inherentlyarbitrary arrangements even when they make practical senseConsider casinos for instance Was there any deep principle behind the old pre1990s dispensation in which New Jersey and Nevada essentially served as the countrys designated outlets for the deepseated urge to risk your money at lousy odds while a sleepless waitress refills your drinks If such a principle existed it wasnt exactly obvious and had I grown up in the general vicinity of Atlantic City or Reno I probably would have resented the set of accidents that turned my native city into the place where everybody else came to party act out occasionally ruin their own lives or their families and despoil a community where they didnt have to live If casino gambling is socially destructive enough to be basically illegal in 48 states I might would have thought then why not in all 50 Or alternatively if its okay for Nevadans to build gambling palaces then why shouldnt it be okay for Minnesotans or Vermonters or Oklahomans as well If theres a right to gamble why shouldnt it apply everywhere  and if casinos come with social costs why not do the fair thing and spread those costs aroundSo too in a slightly different way with the longstanding prohibition on marijuana As advocates for legalizing pot have long protested theres no obviously compelling reason besides the quirks of history and culture that clearly justifies making alcohol a normal part of respectable socializing while consigning weed to the extralegal fringe If I prefer a toke to a drink why should the law draw some spurious culturally contingent distinction that makes my preference criminal and consigns dealers to prison while bartenders walk free If we restrict substances that can damage their users why not do the fair thing and make the restrictions uniformThe answer is  well the answer in both cases is essentially contingent historicist traditionminded We have these inherited limits geographic legal  on certain vices certain selfdestructive activities They are inherently arbitrary yes but they also may do useful work regulating how easily and casually and frequently people indulge in those vices and they may strike a balance between puritanism and permissiveness thats socially useful even if isnt perfectly consistent or obviously fair Whereas making consistency our north star requires either accepting an unsustainable level of repression adding a reboot of Prohibition to the War on Drugs say or telling Americans that Vegas is closed and they have to fly to the Caribbean for those kind of thrills or a damaging level of permissiveness  with the latter quite possibly being what were headed for todayWere headed there because these kind of traditionbased arguments dont satisfy the modern mind but also because in a society that doesnt put much stock in arguments from tradition its hard to go just part of the way on a given social question and then stop With casino gambling for instance I dont think the Indian tribe carveout that brought casinos to a lot of states in the Clinton era was necessarily a good idea but I could imagine someone arguing that it offered a better balance between restriction and release than the Atlantic CityVegas model But whether it was better or not it was seemingly foredoomed to be temporary Once the old taboos were broken and the process got started there was no obvious stopping place no obvious reason why states that had already conceded on the principle of welcoming casinos wouldnt want to claim a large piece of the action for themselves And thats how weve ended up not with the modest expansion of casino gambling that the reservation model seemed to promise but with a race to the bottom by incomehungry statesWith marijuana as I said in the column Im a lot more sympathetic to the steps toward decriminalization that have been taken to date because I think the strictprohibition model has been a pretty clear policy failure with too many attendant injustices in a way that the only in Vegas model of casino policy was not But I also worry that were basically in the only on Indian reservations stage of the progression with pot and that in a generation or so well have passed from the plausible way station of decriminalization to the logical endpoint of full commercial legalization because nobody will be able to adequately explain in principle why using a drug should be legal but turning a profit off it with the attendant bounty of tax dollars for the state should not If I were confident that this process would be managed by say a wise policy mind like Mark Kleiman who favors allowing smallscale production and distribution while maintaining a ban on commercial production I would feel better about where were headed But the Kleiman stopping point however practically desirable has some of the same arbitrariness problems as the old regime and the logic of full legalization just seems like it may prove too powerful for a permissivelyinclined fairnessoriented consistencyseeking society to resist,2013-11-04T12:30:15Z,drugs

NYT,http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/21/cannabis-country/,BUENOS AIRES  For the people of Buenos Aires Uruguay the small country just across the Ro de la Plata estuary can seem like paradise Its not just about the beaches the place has also become a darling of foreign investors even while passing the most progressive social policies in Latin America Now Uruguay seems poised to enact a law that would make it the first country in the world to fully regulate the production sale and distribution of marijuana The initiative is the brainchild of President Jos Mujica Cordano a former guerilla fighter who is often called the worlds poorest president because he hands over 90 percent of his salary to charity He introduced the measure more than a year ago presenting it as a sensible way to combat drug trafficking Uruguayans currently are allowed to smoke marijuana but not to grow or sell it which means consumers buy on the black market usually lowquality weed that comes from Paraguay through Argentina and Brazil Mujica has called this 30 millionayear operation a mafia monopoly because it is run by criminal gangs that use violence to win market sharesHis proposed law would allow every household to cultivate six plants and authorized cannabis cooperatives 99 plants  all strictly for personal use There would be only one legal form of sale The government would buy marijuana produced by specially licensed private companies and then resell it through pharmacies to registered buyers Any Uruguayan resident over 18 could register and buy up to 40 grams a month The Institute for Regulation and Control of Cannabis would be charged with implementing all details of the law including pricing Julio Calzada head of the governments National Drugs Committee recently said that the marijuana would have to sell in the range of what the black market charges because otherwise you cant competeUruguays lower house voted 50 to 46 to approve the measure last month The Senate where Mujicas party Frente Amplio Broad Front holds a comfortable majority is expected to follow suit before the end of the yearThere is some resistance however among the political opposition and the public Despite months of open debates and several amendments to the bill Uruguayans remain skeptical According to a poll last month 63 percent of oppose legalization down only three percentage points since last year and 26 percent are for it just two percentage points more than last yearPeople seem worried that legalization will increase the consumption of marijuana lead to higher drug use in general and turn Uruguay into a destination for drug tourism The share of Uruguayans who are regular weed smokers has grown from 04 percent of the population in 2001 to 49 percent in 2011 And violence has been increasing in the peaceful country a trend often blamed on pasta base a cracklike drug that is a scourge in much of South America Partly to address these concerns Mujica has been arguing that his law is merely an experiment and that if it doesnt have the planned effects the government would backtrack We do not have to be fanatics he said If he manages to reassure both the political opposition and the people Uruguay will outpace the rest of Latin America and even the Organization of American States which has been talking a lot and doing little about legalizing drug use It looks like once again this tiny country  the first in the region to legalize divorceand womens suffrage  is about to teach its neighbors a big lesson,2013-08-21T11:14:57Z,drugs
NYT,http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/21/imagining-the-court/,Linda Greenhouse on the Supreme Court and the lawIts unlikely that the Supreme Court will get its hands on Federal District Judge Shira A Scheindlins ruling that New York Citys aggressive stopandfrisk police tactics violated the constitutional rights of the minorities whose communities the police targeted The Democratic candidates running to succeed Mayor Michael R Bloomberg who is appealing the decision have vowed to overhaul the stopandfrisk approach and end the citys appeal Because the plaintiffs in the lawsuit Floyd v City of New York requested only an injunction and not monetary damages in all likelihood there will be no case left after Inauguration DayGiven that Judge Scheindlin may therefore have the last word I decided to look at her decision through the Supreme Courts lens and imagine how the justices would have viewed it Obviously Judge Scheindlin did the same thing her 198page opinion with its 783 footnotes is chockfull of citations to Supreme Court precedents bearing on the Fourth Amendment searchandseizure and 14th Amendment equalprotection issues posed by the case Her role as the district judge trying the case without a jury was to find the facts and fit them into the existing legal framework But as the Supreme Courts many 5to4 decisions demonstrate different judges can look at the same facts and the same law and come to very different conclusions There is often more than one way to look at a Supreme Court precedent with competing messages to be extracted Judging really is something more than the robotic paintbynumbers exercise so drearily depicted in Supreme Court confirmation hearings A good example of a case with dual messages is  Whren v United States a 1996 Supreme Court decision that figured in Judge Scheindlins analysis Whren is a littleknown but hugely important case decided unanimously with an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia It presented what might be called a vehicular stopandfrisk issue a challenge to a practice by the Washington DC police department of patrolling high drug neighborhoods in unmarked cars stopping drivers for minor traffic violations ordering them out of the car and looking for anything of interest that might be visible In this case what was visible when the officers stopped a car for speeding and failing to signal were two bags of crack cocaine in the drivers hands The argument was that this stop and others like it were pretextual that the police were pretending to be on routine traffic patrol but were really trying to catch drug dealers  impermissibly so the argument went because the police had no reason to suspect that a car with a broken taillight was carrying drugsIt didnt matter the court said the objective reasonableness of the stop not the subjective motivation of the police was all that counted for Fourth Amendment purposes Toward the end of his opinion for the court Justice Scalia added that we of course agree that the Constitution prohibits selective enforcement of the law based on considerations such as race But that he said would be a different case under a different constitutional heading one to bring under the Equal Protection Clause rather than the Fourth Amendments prohibition of unreasonable search and seizure Subjective intentions play no role in ordinary probablecause Fourth Amendment analysis Justice Scalia concludedSo Whren v United States stands for two propositions  one that police officers real motive doesnt matter as long as their actions are objectively reasonable and two that racially selective law enforcement racial profiling although that phrase wasnt in such currency 17 years ago is constitutionally impermissible Which was germane to Judge Scheindlins case Both of course She insisted citing Whren in a footnote that stops be conducted in a racially neutral manner She found that the citys highest officials have turned a blind eye to the evidence that officers are conducting stops in a racially discriminatory manner Proof of this she said was overwhelmingAs to whether particular stops and frisks were based on the requisite reasonable suspicion Judge Scheindlin made no assumptions one way or the other Rather she closely examined each of the 19 individual cases that were part of the lawsuit categorizing them this way nine stops were unconstitutional five stops while constitutional were followed by unconstitutional frisks and the remaining five based on reasonable suspicion were constitutionalAs an aside Mayor Bloombergs intemperate attacks on Judge Scheindlin whom he denounced in a Washington Post oped this week as an ideologically driven federal judge who engaged in brazen activism and showed disdain for our police officers and the dangerous work they do are preposterous and demeaning  not only to the judge but to the mayor himself who surely knows better Judge Scheindlin 67 is a former federal prosecutor who later served as general counsel to the New York City Department of Investigation Before becoming a federal district judge in 1994 she spent four years as a federal magistrate judge in Brooklyn Magistrate judges are the officials who handle much of the nittygritty of the federal courts caseload The notion that Judge Scheindlin is engaged in some kind of radical vendetta against New York City is beyond absurdTo return to my initial question what would the Supreme Court have made of Floyd v City of New York When I embarked on this exercise I thought I would conclude that the decision would be easy pickings for a Supreme Court that has shifted notably to the right since it issued a number of the decisions that Judge Scheindlin cited But instead I found that  well its complicatedOn the one hand the court is capable of displaying an almost goofy disregard for the realities of policecitizen encounters My favorite recent example was a 2011 decision Kentucky v King that upheld the warrantless search of an apartment that the police happened upon by mistake having taken a turn down the wrong corridor while chasing a suspected drug dealer From under the closed door they smelled marijuana After knocking and announcing themselves the only response they got was the sound of people and objects moving around So they kicked the door in saw drugs in plain view conducted a search and found more drugs None of this violated the Fourth Amendment the court held by a vote of 8 to 1 Justice Samuel A Alito Jr wrote the majority opinion with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg the lone dissenter The apartments tenants could simply have told the police to go away Justice Alito said it was the sound of furtive movement that led the officers to believe that evidence was being destroyed justifying their violent uninvited entry Occupants who choose not to stand on their constitutional rights but instead elect to attempt to destroy evidence have only themselves to blame Justice Alito wrote Maybe so  but did the seven justices who signed his opinion actually agree with Justice Alitos paean to the prospect that the police officer banging on your door might really be your friend Citizens who are startled by an unexpected knock on the door or by the sight of unknown persons in plain clothes on their doorstep may be relieved to learn that these persons are police officers he wroteWhile this decision addressing another part of the Fourth Amendment forest isnt directly on point for the New York City case it does raise the question of whether this is a court that could recognize the human toll of unconstitutional stops in Judge Scheindlins wordsBut then there are other cases that suggest a different outcome In 2000 the court unanimously rejected the argument that an anonymous tip justified the police in stopping and frisking a man who looked as described by the informant standing in the place the informant had specified The call to the police said that a young black man dressed in a plaid shirt standing at a particular bus stop was carrying a gun  This proved to be trueBut it wasnt good enough Justice Ginsburg said for the court in Florida v JL because the anonymous tip lacked the indicia of reliability necessary to provide reasonable suspicion If a stopandfrisk based on a very specifically worded tip didnt make the Fourth Amendment grade then logically neither should stops based on nothing but location and ethnicityAs I said its complicated Under the Supreme Courts precedents governing municipal liability for constitutional violations it isnt enough to prove that egregious violations occurred Plaintiffs must show that the violations occurred as the result of an official policy which Judge Scheindlin found Of course New York officials deny that there was any policy other than good police work What makes a policy is a question the Supreme Court has stumbled over for decades without conclusively resolvingAnd then theres the question of racial discrimination Supreme Court precedents since the 1970s have required evidence of intentional discrimination in order to prove a violation of the 14th Amendments equal protection guarantee Evidence that a policy  the death penalty is a prime example  has a disproportionate impact on people of one race is not sufficient In a sense this is a conundrum at the heart of the New York case Questions of a police officers real motives are out of bounds when it comes to the Fourth Amendment yet proof of a discriminatory motive is required for proving a 14th Amendment violationJudge Scheindlin addressed the discriminatory intent question at several points in her opinion She said that plaintiffs had to prove that a discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor but not necessarily the sole predominant or determinative factor in a police enforcement action The plaintiffs in this case met that test she concludedWhether the current Supreme Court would accept this generous gloss on the discriminatory intent standard  a motivating factor but not the only factor  is I think an open question Its safe to say that the courts equal protection jurisprudence is currently in flux heading in the direction of making 14th Amendment violations harder not easier to proveHow would Floyd v City of New York have fared at the Supreme Court The answer is Im not sure Pondering the question has been an abstract exercise in the absence of a Court of Appeals decision that would precede any Supreme Court appeal and without the briefs that would define and sharpen the issues But with only six weeks to go before the first Monday in October and the courts return its worth trying to limber up for the justices return by looking at this case through their eyes To the question of whether Im glad the case will likely not find its way to the Supreme Courts door the answer is yes,2013-08-21T21:00:54Z,drugs
NYT,http://nocera.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/15/weekend-gun-report-july-12-14-2013/,Yes the George Zimmerman verdict was reached on Saturday and there is much to say about itabout the implications of the case regarding racial profiling Stand Your Ground legislation and our gun laws or lack thereof But many others have weighed in on these issues So instead we are going to draw your attention to a story that broke early last week which has gotten much less publicityDo you remember that horrible shooting in April in Burkesville Ky in which a fiveyearold boy shot and killed his twoyearold sister with a gun made specially for children that hed been given as a gift A week ago the county prosecutor decided that no one would be charged with a crime in the little girls death because according to investigators the family didnt realize the gun was loaded This decision is completely unsurprising even in states that are less guncrazed than Kentucky prosecutors are reluctant to charge parents criminally when a child finds a loaded gun in the house and accidentally shoots someone There is too much sympathy for the parents and the pain their mistake has already caused themBut this is precisely why these accidents continue to take place When there are no legal consequences there is no incentive to change behavior Until that starts to happen The Gun Report sadly will continue to be

NYT,http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/06/big-pot/,Timothy Egan on American politics and life as seen from the WestThey assembled on the 40th floor of the tallest building in Seattle last week the exMexican president and the businessman who wants to be known as the Bill Gates of Bud On the table a pie bigger than the sky It would involve drugs  suppliers and retailers and lasertargeted marketing for buyers willing to pay a premium The wouldbe mogul Jamen Shively is trying to make the leap from Microsoft to marijuana Hes not shy He wants to plant the first brandname retail chain in the United States in a market worth upward of 100 billion Yes we are Big Marijuana he said as cameras clickedThe expresident Vicente Fox has seen his country suffer decades of carnage and corruption all in service of this same market  the one that exists now run by gangsters drug lords and sketchy characters on city corners  To go legal big and capitalistic said Fox  who has no financial stake in Shivelys operation would be a game changer for MexicoStarbucks is a role model as is Kentucky bourbon Theres a land rush going on now Shively said in an interview Not for real estate but for brandsIf it all seemed like a bit of venture capital vapor with too many questions left unanswered jawdropping in its audacity its because no one has gone where two states in the American West Washington and Colorado are now going with the pioneering blueprints for how to sell pot legally  Depending or your view its either Lewis and Clark crossing the Continental Divide for the first time or a step into slowmotion quicksand Mark Kleiman the academic brought in to advise Washington State after voters approved of recreational marijuana use last fall certainly has his doubts It was inevitable that the legalization of cannabis would attract a certain number of insensate greedheads to the industry he wrote in a blog post after Shivelys news  conference And I suppose that it was also inevitable that some of them would be terminally stupid and selfdestructiveMarijuana selling and conspiring to sell it remains a federal crime Kleiman noted Until the Obama administration says otherwise schemes to open a giant chain of pot outlets could be seen as the kind of activity that might attract federal prosecutors When I asked Shively about this critique he said that if hes guilty of conspiring to break federal law the states of Washington and Colorado are as criminal as he is But they shouldnt be  Attorney General Eric Holder  beleaguered on many fronts  has a monumental decision to make on whether to let two Western rogue states lead the way out of the senseless bog of pot prohibitionFor as preposterous greedy and nutty as the business plan outlined by Shively may be the alternative is far worse In 2010 the states spent an estimated 36 billion enforcing laws against simple possession of marijuana  a 30 percent increase from 10 years earlier About half of all drug arrests are for marijuana meaning 800000 people a year are cuffed cited or jailed for doing something that a majority of Americans believe should be legalWhen a law is that widely abused in a democracy  the latest estimates are that 7 percent of the population uses marijuana regularly  it loses its moral validity Imagine if that 36 billion in law enforcement money went to something less Sisyphean Then imagine how much additional money the states could take in for schools health care or substance abuse problems if they put a big tax on pot Washington has crunched the numbers and the highend estimate is about  2  billion in tax revenue over five yearsFurther we now know that marijuana laws are used as a cudgel to selectively target a certain race Guess which one  A major study released earlier this week found that blacks are four times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession as whites even though similar percentages of whites and blacks use it And even if legalization of one drug would not end Mexican narco deaths linked to a number of illicit substances putting a dent in a trade that is responsible for 60000 peoples being  killed in drugrelated violence over the last six years is no small thing Yes but wouldnt Big Marijuana would be like Big Tobacco or Big Alcohol Do we really need another Philip Morris or Budweiser controlling our controlled substances  Even Patrick Dempsey who plays the McDreamy character in televisions Greys Anatomy and who is trying to finalize a purchase of the Seattle coffee chain Tullys has talked of expanding from one drug to another in a big wayTheres a business model there he told Bon Apptit You could present it in a beautiful elegant way a Michelinstarred coffee shop where you can get marijuana The beer industry at least is proof that thousands of smallscale microbreweries can thrive alongside the suds conglomerates that sell undrinkable industrial swill  Finally history shows that vice when regulated and taxed is far healthier for a society than black market vice The mob used to control numbers rackets now the states make billions selling those sucker bets to their citizens  Prohibition of alcohol of course launched countless criminals and all the attendant violence  Its much better to have Costco peddling spirits than a moonshiner with an assault rifle  Police departments used to have bunco squads to crack down on gambling parlors  Now the dens of chance are in churches I drove by the Catholic church from my boyhood in Spokane a few days ago Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary The place where I became an altar boy had a big sign out front promoting its latest initiative Bunco Night Who knows in 10 years they may be selling marijuana brownies at the same event,2013-06-06T21:00:41Z,drugs

One Equity which manages 45 billion of the banks money was not in response to that according to a person briefed on the matter DealBooks Peter Lattman reports Instead this person said the decision is a reflection of JPMorgans emphasis on its client businesses rather than making investments off the firms balance sheetOne of the banks reasons for deemphasizing its private equity investments  especially the ones that were made by its largest unit JPMorgan Partners  is that it didnt want to be in businesses that directly competed with some of its prized private equity clients like the

NYT,http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/should-marijuana-be-legal/,Eighteen states have legalized marijuana for medical use Should it be legal for medical use all over the United States Should it also be legal for recreational use for consumers who are 21 and over as Washington and Colorado have allowed In general do you think the current federal prohibition on marijuana is good public policy or not WhyIn Americas Coalition Puts Marijuana Legalization Up for Discussion Randal C Archibold writes about the Organization of American Statess suggestion that countries consider making marijuana legal as a possible way to reassess how the drug war is carried out A comprehensive report on drug policy in the Americas released Friday by a consortium of nations suggests that the legalization of marijuana but not other illicit drugs be considered among a range of ideas to reassess how the drug war is carried outThe report released by the Organization of American States walked a careful line in not recommending any single approach to the drug problem and encouraging flexibilityPrompted by President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia at the Summit of the Americas last year to answer growing dissatisfaction and calls for new strategies in the drug war the reports 400 pages mainly summarize and distill previous research and debate on the subjectBut the fact that it gave weight to exploring legalizing or depenalizing marijuana was seized on by advocates of more liberal drug use laws as a landmark and a potential catalyst for less restrictive laws in a number of countriesThis takes the debate to a whole other level said Ethan Nadelmann executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance which advocates more liberal drug use laws It effectively breaks the taboo on considering alternatives to the current prohibitionist approachStudents Tell us Students 13 and older are invited to comment below Please use only your first name For privacy policy reasons we will not publish student comments that include a last nameNOTE We ask that adults respect the intent of the Student Opinion question and refrain from posting here There are many other places on NYTimescom for adults to post while this is the only place that explicitly invites the voices of young people ,2013-05-21T05:02:14Z,drugs

NYT,http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/marriage-and-historical-inevitability/,And now to finish up my triptych of replies to Kevin Drum on marriage Heres his conclusionThe economic and social forces behind the decline in marriage are decades old stagnant incomes for men growing incomes for women an incarceration explosion thats left black male communities decimated and a feminist revolution that made single parenthood more socially acceptable Against that backdrop I guess I find it unlikely that a fairly esoteric debate about procreation which took place mostly among the chattering classes had a significant impact on the people who are actually abandoning marriageMy last post tried to deal a bit with the question of whether the debate about procreation is really esoteric but I want to use Drums take the long view point to discuss the more determinist arguments for current trends in marriage culture which Ive been reading lately from a lot of writers I respectDrum is basically making the liberal version which tends to focus on the deep power of post1960s socioeconomic trends you can find another take in this post by the Atlantics Derek Thompson which emphasizes the changing economic incentives including to his credit the incentives created by legal abortion facing working class couples since the 1970s Up to a point theirs is an argument that I agree with in the sense that I think everything from wage stagnation to mass incarceration to the impact of the Great Recession is important to understanding whats been happening to the social fabric in middle America and important to designing any kind of policy responseBut I also thinkculture and economics ideas and incentives are all entangled at a deep level working in cycles and feedback loops rather than in simple causal arrows and thus its amistake to treat changes in what people believe and particularly the sweeping generational changes in how Americans conceptualize the links between sex and marriage and procreation just as epiphenomena of economic pressure And itsa particularly convenient mistake for social liberals because it enables them to downplay the fact that these changes are also their own ideological victories  victories thathave been accompanied by well many of the negative consequences that social conservatives warned against in the first place In large ways and small and now at a suddenlyaccelerating pace today gay marriage tomorrow marijuana legalization etc were getting the culture that social liberalism wants less traditionally religious and more socially permissive with fewer normative ideas about how sex and love and childbearing fit together And if conservatives would profit from acknowledging the economic forces shaping these realities liberals would profit from acknowledging that maybe just maybe a cultural transformation that theyve long favored is coming at a costThen theres a stilldeeper form of determinism on these questions which acknowledges the significance of culture and the power of ideology and ideas but then argues that todays trend away from the institutionalprocreative view of marriage is simply too deeply rooted in the logic of modern liberal society to be shifted from its courseHeres Damon Linker taking us back to the cultural revolution wrought by the birth control pill to explain why the contemporary landscape was inevitable heres Noah Millman taking us back to womens suffrage heres Dan McCarthy taking us back to Thomas HobbesAnd up to a point I agree with their arguments as well I was pretty much convinced that gay marriage was inevitable ten years ago maybe because I read this remarkably prescient Ramesh Ponnuru piece and most everything Ive written on the subject in the last few years has been informed by that assumption If a serious look at culture vindicates social conservatives in certain ways it also helps explains why theyve lost and lost and lostBut to the cultural inevitabilists Id just say this As much as liberalism and modernity and the sexual revolution have reshaped human relations they have not  or notyet pending the Singularity alchemized human nature into something entirely different A glance at post1960s trends will demonstrate that the birth control pill did not actually sever sex from pregnancy and childbearing An hour in a nursery will remind you that the decline of the twoparent family hasnt eliminated the basic desire of children to know their parents A fairminded look at the fabric of American life will reveal significant advantages to being connected to the kind of communities that are still shaped by the older marital ideal Andboth politics and writing in different ways exist in part to assert human agency in the face of trends that seem inexorable and impersonal  to hold up ideals even when fewer people are living up to them to try to shape and redirect trends rather than taking them as a given to mitigate the excesses of revolutions and try to preserve the best of the old even when the new comes rushing inI understand the unfolding historical logic of the retreat from marriageas well as anyone and Im under no illusions that the present move to formally redefine the institution represents any kind of uniquely transformative moment in that process But its the moment were in now and so it affords an opportunity to talk about the process as a whole to raise questions about whether our current historical momentum is identical with progress to note the merits of alternative models that were not only drifting away from but as of now deliberately leaving behindThat doesnt mean pretending that theres some political strategy the Republican Party should embrace to turn public opinion on a dime There isnt and thats been obvious for a while But even when youre in the process of surrendering on a particular point it makes a difference how surrender happens and what if anything you can persuade your victorious opponents to concede Because even when change seems inevitable the pace of that change is not because history is littered with trends that seemed unstoppable and then stopped because ideas can hibernate as well as die And because nobody knows the futureNobody knows the future,2013-04-05T12:02:59Z,drugs

NYT,http://straightsets.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/a-fast-climb-after-a-steep-fall/,INDIAN WELLS Calif  Ernests Gulbis has often seemed pretty far gone but now he seems to be on his way backA former French Open quarterfinalist who nearly reached the top 20 Gulbis a 24yearold Latvian fell out of the top 130 last year and was relegated to the Challenger circuit and qualifying draws of main tour eventsBut after choosing not to make the long trip to the Australian Open qualifiers in January Gulbis has surged winning the Delray Beach title last week as a qualifier for his third career ATP World Tour crownHis ranking jumped 42 spots in one week to No 67 from No 109 It is likely to continue climbing given his paucity of points to defendBut he is more than just a dangerous player Gulbiss return also means the return of one of the games best talkers unabashed partiers and biggest personalitiesAfter winning his 10th straight match Wednesday to qualify for the main draw of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells Gulbis sat down to share his thoughts on his fall and rise in tennis the vices that held him back and his racketsmashing prowessTen straight matches  pretty good How do you feel nowTiredIs it too much in too short a time for you playing qualifying at both of these tournamentsIts not nice to play qualies over all It just gets you tired and the matches are as tough as it is in main draw because a lot of the guys are really goodSo its tough but it is how it isNow I am getting my ranking back up so hopefully soon enough Ill be in main drawIts probably something you didnt plan for when you were winning a lot of matches before being out of the top 100 playing Challengers playing qualies But do you think youre handling it OKLaughs You know I used to say that its really tough to get out of the top 100 you know So I proved to everybody that its not so tough its pretty easy LaughsWhat were the keys for you to get out of the top 100The key moments Laughs To not practice good enough change the coaches not have a system The usual stuff Basically yeah its not a big secret If you practice good if you practice hard the results is going to come If you dont the results are not going to comeIts that simpleI didnt do it good enough and I dropped out of itBut still I believe that its really tough to get out of the top 100 you know because you play most of the tournaments in main draw and if youve made it to top 100 that means that you can win a couple matchesSo youre going to win a couple matches there and thats it Thats like 300 points right thereWhen you were practicing not well what was that like What is practice that isnt goodIt wasnt really when Im on court I always practice hard If I step on the court that means that Im ready to practice and its not like Im going to give 100 percent I give 100 percent when Im on court But you know its the way you practice what kind of goals you have You can have one good practice session but that doesnt give you nothingYou have to have a consistent good practice session throughout weeks months which I have right now because I didnt play Australia I had a longer preparationSo I really had good systematic work for one month and now it pays offYou know Im fit as I ever was Im playing good tennis I think I still have some place to improve but I think if I get some big wins over some big guys I think thats gonna be a moment where I maybe make the step where I dont lose anymore to certain playersThat seemed to pay off skipping Australia even though it was surprising because you would have been in the range of players to be seeded in qualifyingOf course now if I look back it helpedIt was a tough decision because the career is as long as it is and to skip a Grand Slam is a big decisionBut Australia is pretty far away everything is really expensive to go there and if you play qualies you dont make nothing so basically you have to put your own 10000 to go there and then who knows how its going to pay off So basically I chose to put that money into building my game up instead of going to Australia and who knows how I would have done thereAre you surprised this success now has come so fast for youYeah I said a couple times already in Delray Beach I spoke to my coach and he said Im going to get back into top 100 in AprilSo hes really happy that it happened so fastAnd Im a bit surprised of course because I played in Marseille and I lost the match a good match to Berdych and then the next morning four oclock in the morning I had to go to the airport I come to America I practice once and the next day I play qualies It was a messNo preparation at all nothing But the matches got me through I didnt play well at all when I played there I played really bad First round it was a little easier in the qualies but then it was tough matchesI beat Marchenko who was a top100 player and Molchanov who is a consistent 200 player I have to beat themBut still I was prepared and yeah thank God that it went that wayYou talk about how short a career is how big a decision it was to skip a Grand Slam Do you regret things in your past in terms of feeling like you wasted time years of your career you could have spent betterYeah but you know I got some kind of experience which I have now which I wouldnt have if I would have made itI wouldnt trade it for nothing this experience Because as soon as you go on tour as soon as youre a newcomer everybody is really nice to you Its like youre the newcomer who knows maybe youre going to be the big thing And everybody wants to be close to you the agents the friends or whateverSo now I was a newcomer and I was a goaway player And now Im coming back so its a good experience and Ive been here and Ive been there I didnt make it to top 10 but I had some good results I was playing in the big tournaments pretty far I made quarters in Grand Slams and semis in Masters so Ive been close to that I just want this time to make a step forward and stay thereI saw an interview you did in Rotterdam where you talked about how youd stopped smoking and drinking and that was going to help you now How much do you think that stuff was holding you backIt is you know because I dont say that Im a heavy smoker or a heavy drinkerIm just a regular young guyBut to be a professional athlete you need to not be a regular young guyYou need to watch what youre doing a little bit more and I wasnt doing thatI could go out and get wasted and smoke some stuff you knowNot some stuff cigarettes Marijuana unfortunately its not legal for tennis players which I honestly dont understand why But thats my own opinionBut yeah now I quit everything and I live a healthy lifestyleI dont know how long Im going to do that Laughs If the results come Im going to keep on doing thatAnd now the results are comingI tell you it pays offWas that a problem for more players than just you the drinking and smokingNo If I look around nobody is doing that reallyJust youNow you put me in a position that Im the alcoholic on tour Laughs No thats also not trueOf course a lot of people like to go out But I dont know everybody has their own background how they grow up what they were doing what kind of company they were in My company was you know a lot of fun guys a lot of fun people and it wasnt really a sportsmans company you know And there if youre the only one who is a pioneer and not drinking and have to be in bed by 11 oclock you know youre not going to be in that company anymore You have to stay until three in the morningSo you werent really in an isolated environment where it was just sports sports sports all the timeNo I was I was in Munich in Niki Pilics tennis academy But I had really cool guys there practicingAnd when we were practicing we were practicing but it was a fun time starting from age of 16 when you just start to get to know things We were having our fun Its nothing bad with it its just how you make the balanceSomebody still does it somebody has a bottle of wine or doesnt sleep at night its not a big deal Its just how everybody understands what he wants to do in life and what his goal is and thats itAnd I understand it now you know Im still pretty young I thinkIm 24 and maybe somebody doesnt understand it all his life So I think I made a good decisionWas there one moment where the effects of what you were doing were bad and it was a wakeup call for youNo its just frustratingYou know Ive been on tour for a pretty long time alreadyIm young but Ive been long I started to play early so I feel already like a veteran on the tourSo its frustrating when you go to the same tournaments every year I see the guys whos playing I see the guys whos winning the tournaments and I know that if I play well and if I do everything thats right I can beat that guy who is winning the tournament Because I truly believe that I am better than some of the guys who are winning and who are higher ranked I believe that and you know I need to start to prove it to myself especiallyAnd that was yeah like a clickEither I do it or I dont do itBecause again my goal is not to be ranked No 50 in the world from No 50 to 100 all my careerFor what It doesnt interest meSo Im going to try to do it maybe I dont know four five more years thats itAnd then I have no regrets when Im doneWas there one loss that really stuck for you and motivated youNo no not reallyJust the end of the season you know I looked at the rankings and Im No 130I played at the end of the season in some Challengers in the most depressing places in dark winter GermanyThats tough you know because its a big difference between the ATP Tour and the Challengers its a big difference how the players get treated Its still a big difference for example if you play qualifying or main draw Its still a big difference  maybe not here because its a big tournament  but at smaller events they treat you differently and I dont like it If youre in the tournament if youre a player respect thatI dont understand why for example yesterday I didnt have a Hawkeye on the court today we had it I dont understand why Make the same rules for everybody or make it a different eventMaybe somebody explains me this Ill understand it but I dontDo you think that you are an easy player to coachI think Im  you know I dont want to sound arrogant but my coach said to me that hes really happy that hes coaching me because theres not a lot of players with such a potential and such a game as mineI think Im not easy to coach for sure Im not maybe an easy character I have maybe sometimes some schizophrenical thoughts in my headStill Im an interesting player to coach because I can win something big I think so my coach thinks soWin something big  do you mean a Grand Slam Is that still in your mindThats my dream for sureThats definitely my biggest dream in tennis to win a Grand SlamIt seems that with how dominant the top four guys are it can seem that some of the players who are between 5 and 20 have sometimes given up the dream of winning the whole thingDo you think thats true that maybe others have stopped believing but you still believeI dont know Its a good question I dont know reallyMe for sure I have lot of doubts because look at meI didnt win nothing big yetI win just three titles and my career has been up and downBut still its really easy to see whos got game and who doesnt have gameThe way the people hit the ball in the practiceWhen somebody has the pace and somebodys ball after the ball bounce is really heavy and with a lot of spin and a lot of pressureAnd somebody is just hitting the ball and running and doing nothingFor me those guys can never win nothing big you know And some players you see the ball is heavyAnd the top four guys have the heaviest ball Thats why theyre thereOne shot of yours that seems different now is your forehandYeah it changed a lotWhy did you decide to change itWhen I started to work with my coach now Gunther Bresnik in Vienna I wanted to change itAnd I told him I wanted to play like when I was younger with a more relaxed swing and more aggressiveHe agreed so we started to work on itIm just trying to put all my attention that my forehand is aggressive and the rest it doesnt matter I hit the fence I hit the fence No problem Just that its aggressive and I dont lose my swing Its really tough for me because its in my nature to change my shotsIts really easy for me I dont play for example for one week and I take the racket and I start to hit a different shotAnd then I get used to it and then I need again to change stuffSo I always need to be really concentrated on what Im doingYour left hand on your forehand shoots out way in front of you in front of your faceIm not really thinking about it its something natural But the swing itself I think its more relaxed and I have more power in the shotSo its good but its not perfect yet needs some more changesSo whats next for you in the next few months Obviously these two weeks have been incredible but how do you see the future goingYou know honestly I dont like this feeling because I start to get nervous a little bit in matchesBecause I know that I can win the matches and I know that honestly that I can go far even in this tournamentAnd I dont like this feeling because Im a little bit getting too nervous and too emotional about it on the court you know I want to not think about it and just keep doing what I did the last three months and just see where it goesBecause if Im going to do it Im going to have a lot of chancesI dont want to put too much pressure because I always thought OK now is the week when I need to make it And then my expectations are so high and then when you have high expectations and the disappointment is really big you know I had a lot of disappointments so I dont want to set any expectations at all Whatever comes comesAnd Im happy about itYou feel more pressure when youre playing well and so thats something that you couldnt have felt when you were playing challengers and ranked outside the top 130So this is a good thing that you feel you should be winning moreIts a good thing yeah but I want to deal with it in a more easy way you know I dont want to get nervous and frustratedI dont like to break rackets I dont like to get emotional on the court Its just something that happens and I need to learn to deal with itYoure really good at breaking rackets thoughYou just throw it and it breaksThat for sure Im the best on the tour inIts special technique and a little bit powerIs that something you can practiceI get like 50 rackets from Wilson And I keep on breaking them all the time,2013-03-07T12:34:03Z,drugs
NYT,http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/legalizing-of-marijuana-raises-health-concerns/,In the 60s marijuana was a hallmark of the counterculture along with free love bell bottoms long hair and bandannas But marijuana has had the most staying powerThis month in a remarkable first the recreational use of marijuana became legal depending on your definition in Colorado and Washington Over a dozen other states have decriminalized possession of small amounts and Massachusetts recently became the 18th state to allow its use for medicinal purposesThough federal law still bans both the sale and possession of marijuana President Obama has said the federal government has bigger fish to fry and wont aggressively prosecute tokers in states where its use is legalThe rise of marijuana as an adult pastime is a victory for those whove always felt that its hazards were overblown Proponents of legalization argue that marijuana is much safer to use than alcohol pointing out that it is virtually impossible to overdose on marijuanaWhile marijuana can be addictive scientists generally agree that fewer than 10 percent of marijuana smokers become dependent on the drug compared with 15 percent for alcohol 23 percent for heroin and 32 percent for tobacco Marijuana does contain carcinogens including tar and other toxins similar to those found in tobacco but people generally do not smoke marijuana in the same amounts as cigarettesStill legalization takes health consumers into murky territory Even though marijuana is the most commonly used illegal drug in the United States questions about its health effects remainFor starters this is not your parents pot Todays marijuana is much more potent The mean concentration of THC the psychoactive ingredient in confiscated cannabis more than doubled between 1993 and 2008Increased potency may be having unforeseen consequences The human brains cannabinoid receptors are typically activated by naturally occurring chemicals in the body called endocannabinoids which are similar to THC There is a high density of cannabinoid receptors in parts of the brain that affect pleasure memory and concentration Some research suggests that these areas continue to be affected by marijuana use even after the high dissipatesIts much more potent marijuana which may explain why weve seen a pretty dramatic increase in admission to emergency rooms and treatment programs for marijuana said Dr Nora D Volkow director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse When we hear Well I smoked and nothing happened to me we need to think about the context of when these people started to take it how frequently they used and how active the marijuana wasThose in favor of legalizing marijuana say the increase in potency has been exaggerated and that when users have more powerful pot they adjust their consumption and actually smoke lessTeenagers may be more vulnerable to addiction however and those who start smoking pot at a younger age are at higher risk Approximately one in six will become addicted Dr Volkow said Young adults who start smoking marijuana at earlier ages also tend to smoke much more and more often than those who start in their later teens researchers sayIn users who develop a dependence or addiction quitting can cause intense withdrawal symptoms like anxiety trouble sleeping lack of appetite mood swings irritability and depression experts sayBoth Colorado and Washington restricted marijuana use to adults age 21 and over when they legalized recreational use in November But experts worry that the perception of marijuana is changing because its stigma as an outlawed drug has erodedWhen people can go to a clinic or cafe and buy pot that creates the perception that its safe said Dr A Eden Evins director of the Center for Addiction Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston Before we unleash the powers of the marketplace to woo people to use this addictive substance we need to better understand who is at riskOnce moneyed interests are involved this trend will be difficult to reverse she addedThe most disturbing new studies about early teenage use of marijuana showed that young adults who started smoking pot regularly before they were 16 performed significantly worse on cognitive tests of brain function than those who had started smoking later in adolescence They performed particularly poorly on tests assessing executive function which is responsible for planning and abstract thinking as well as understanding rules and inhibiting inappropriate responsesImaging scans also found detectable differences in how their brains worked said Staci Gruber the lead author of these studies and director of the cognitive and clinical neuroimaging core at the imaging center at McLean Hospital in Boston Imaging scans found alterations in the frontal cortex white matter tracts of the brain in the earlystarters she said that are associated with impulsivenessThe frontal cortex is the last part of the brain to come online and the most important Dr Gruber said Early exposure perhaps changes the trajectory of brain development such that ability to perform complex executive function tasks is compromisedA recent study showing a drop in IQ scores among teenagers who are regular pot smokers is especially troubling Dr Evins said A more recent study found that people who started smoking marijuana as teenagers and used it heavily for decades lost IQ points over time while those who started smoking as adults did not though some critics have said these differences may not be meaningful Older survey studies had indicated that regular pot smokers were less likely to graduate from high school or pursue higher education but it was never clear which came first difficulty in school or the drug useIf parents who are spending thousands of dollars on SAT prep courses knew about the cognitive effects marijuana has on their kids brains they would be up in arms Dr Evins said Other health concerns about marijuana are less well documented but may turn out to be significant States that legalized marijuana prohibit driving under its influence and studies have found marijuana smoking increases weaving between lanes and slows reaction times And although marijuana is not as damaging to the lungs as tobacco in part because people do not smoke a pack of joints a day a regular habit can eventually take a toll on the lungsAt the very least the new studies suggest parents who recall their own pot parties may want to suggest greater moderation to their children And teenagers who insist on trying marijuana are better off waiting until theyre olderIts the same message as with alcohol Dr Gruber said Just hold on its worth it to waitReaders may submit comments or questions for

NYT,http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/08/marijuana-legalization-and-states-rights/,As the Obama administration weighs its response to the legalization of the recreational use of marijuana in Washington and Colorado a new YouGov poll has found that a slim majority of adults believe the federal government should not enforce federal laws  under which marijuana use is still illegal  in those statesThe YouGov survey conducted for The Huffington Post on Dec 5 and 6 found that 51 percent of the 1000 adults interviewed said the federal government should exempt adults who follow state law from enforcement Thirty percent said the federal government should enforce its drug laws the same way it does in other states the poll foundSupport for legalizing marijuana use  and not simply for medical purposes  has been rising steadily since the early 1990s The most recent polls have shown a public divided A CBS News poll from midNovember found an even split with 47 percent supporting legalization and 47 percent opposed A more recent Quinnipiac University poll found a bare majority supporting legalization 51 percent to 44 percentBut the YouGov poll is one of the first to ask not whether marijuana use should be legal but what the federal government should do about it now that two states have legalized recreational marijuana useThe share of respondents who want the federal government to leave the states alone roughly matches the share of respondents that polls have found favor legalization about halfThe difference is in the percentage of adults who favor the federal government still enforcing federal law While polls have found that half or close to half of American adults generally oppose legalization the YouGov poll found that only about a third of respondents favored enforcing federal law in states that had decided to legalize useInstead 20 percent of respondents in the YouGov poll said that they were not sure what the federal government should do more than double the percentage of adults that polls have usually found to be undecided on the overall question of legalizationThe YouGov poll is just one data point and more polling will yield a fuller picture But a portion of American adults who oppose the legalization of marijuana may also be partial to states rights and those two impulses are in tension hereThe CBS News survey pinpointed the same conflict According to the poll 59 percent of adults said the question of legalization should be left to the states rather than the federal government including 49 percent of respondents who oppose legalization,2012-12-08T16:47:32Z,drugs
NYT,http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/07/taxing-marijuana/,Heres a thought for a tax increase that might at least break some of the tension in the room between President Obama and John Boehner a marijuana tax Its not as ludicrous an idea as it might seem This week Washington became the first state in the nation where marijuana is legal for recreational use Colorado is set to follow its lead soonThe fact that some states are starting to relax their marijuana laws got analysts at the Tax Policy Center thinking What if the drug were legalized nationwide and taxed The center looked at two studies one of which estimated that a marijuana tax could bring in 9 billion a year in state and federal tax revenues and save roughly the same amount on law enforcement The study made certain assumptions about price and demand and applied taxes comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco as well as income taxes on those making money in the legalized trade Another study pointed to an estimate from California officials that marijuana legalization could add 14 billion to the states economy but doubted whether that much revenue would actually materializeNow of course 9 billion isnt much One percent of the countrys gross domestic product is about 150 billion And this years deficit is about 1 trillion The tax increases and spending cuts set to begin taking effect on Jan 1 if Mr Obama and Mr Boehner arent able to agree on a plan to head them off add up to about 600 billionIs a marijuana tax a bit fanciful in the nearterm Probably Federal prosecutors arent planning on making it any easier for these states to tax marijuana In fact the White House and the Justice Department have been considering whether to pursue legal action against Colorado and Washington to block their new marijuana laws ,2012-12-07T13:31:49Z,drugs
NYT,http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/27/thanks-mom-for-not-telling-the-world-i-pulled-a-knife-on-you/,I dont remember what my mother and I were fighting about but I do remember the moment when I pulled out a knife I was 15 and we were arguing about something As is often the case with adolescent fights it was probably about something ridiculous like my outfit Nevertheless there I was holding a knife It was a shock move of course I was trying to take control of the argument I didnt intend to hurt anyone as a lifelong vegetarian I couldnt bring myself to eat a fish stick let alone harm a human but I did want to get her attention This is how much pain Im in I said What do I have to do to make you understand that Then I dipped the tip of the knife into my skin and cut a very shallow gash on the back of my armBeing a teenager is hard sometimes It can also be a little bit melodramatic Today I dont have the words to describe how happy and fortunate I am Ive been blessed to attend college and graduate school receive two Fulbright grants and  the most extraordinary gift of all  to have met the love of my life Ive recently found another reason to thank my lucky stars I went through my adolescence in the early 2000s before blogs infiltrated modern motherhood If my mother had written publicly about the things I said and did as a teenager well  God I suppose my life might look entirely different today The issue of mental health in children and adolescents is critically important and families who are struggling deserve nothing but help support and understanding But it frightens me that personal blogs and major media outlets have suddenly become acceptable venues for parents to publicly speculate about whether or not their children are mentally ill This month one mother began a national conversation with a viral blog post in which she called her son mentally ill specifically citing an episode where he pulled a knife Other parents quickly added their own stories of frightening or aggressive behavior theyd seen in their own childrenIm not a mother so I can only imagine how devastatingly painful it must be to wonder if your child suffers from mental illness or pathological violence I suppose that these parents frustrated by the lack of resources and institutional support that would help them deal with their situations release that frustration in their blogs Its an understandable impulse  But it is one thing to broadcast your own pain It is quite another to broadcast your childs In this Internet age children deserve to struggle into adulthood with some degree of privacy If my mother had publicized that moment when I cut my arm it could have devastated my future in incalculable ways My college applications or job prospects might have been affected New friends classmates or colleagues could have judged me based on momentary mistakes that happened years earlier The man who became my fianc might not have kissed me that lifechanging night on our college campus The Internet is written in pen and a public reputation or speculative diagnosis that a child is saddled with online now could follow him for the rest of his life We absolutely must have a national conversation about access to mental heath care but we need to find a way to do it without sacrificing individual children as public examples Parents should be the first line of defense to protect their childrens privacy but sometimes they arent In those cases children have few avenues for protection or defense Defamation cases involving minors can be tried in civil court but because children have no legal standing a parent or other adult would have to file the lawsuit Those cases would also be very difficult to prove since the potential longterm impacts of childhood defamation are hard to measureSo in the absence of other protections the media has an important responsibility not to republish gratuitous material that could damage a childs longterm personal or professional prospects A few months ago when I wrote an essay that described my relationship with my fianc he had to give his consent to The New York Times in writing no less before they would publish it Because children dont have that opportunity major news outlets need to exercise more discretion Parental consent is important of course But its not the only important factor A child should never be drafted against his will as a public symbol of mental illness and violence or anything elseBlogs will continue to exist and parents will continue to exercise their profoundly important constitutional right to blog about whatever they want But the media doesnt have to amplify the public evisceration of children who are utterly unable to defend themselves As a teenager I made mistakes I experimented with marijuana said cruel and hurtful things that I regret and even had violent outbursts Maybe you did too But we grew up We left those moments behind us Our futures werent determined by our worst moments as children they are being determined I hope by our very best moments as adults Children today deserve nothing less,2012-12-27T11:15:57Z,drugs
NYT,http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/22/give-pot-a-chance/,Timothy Egan on American politics and life as seen from the WestSEATTLE  In two weeks adults in this state will no longer be arrested or incarcerated for something that nearly 30 million Americans did last year For the first time since prohibition began 75 years ago recreational marijuana use will be legal the miseryinducing crusade to lock up thousands of ordinary people has at last been seen by a majority of voters in this state and in Colorado for what it is a monumental failure That is unless the Obama administration steps in with an injunction as it has threatened to in the past against common sense For what stands between ending this absurd front in the deadender war on drugs and the status quo is the federal government It could intervene citing the supremacy of federal law that still classifies marijuana as a dangerous drugBut it shouldnt Social revolutions in a democracy especially ones that begin with voters should not be lightly dismissed Forget all the lame jokes about Cheetos and Cheech and Chong In the twoandahalf weeks since a pair of progressive Western states sent a message that arresting 853000 people a year for marijuana offenses is an insult to a country built on individual freedom a whiff of positive even monumental change is in the airIn Mexico where about 60000 people have been killed in drugrelated violence political leaders are voicing cautious optimism that the tide could turn for the better What happens when the United States the largest consumer of drugs in the world suddenly opts out of a black market that is the source of gangland death and corruption That question in small part may now be answered Prosecutors in Washington and Colorado have announced they are dropping cases effective immediately against people for pot possession Ive heard from a couple of friends who are police officers and guess what they have a lot more to do than chase around recreational drug users   Maine eversensible Maine and Iowa where the political soil is uniquely suited to good ideas are looking to follow the Westerners Within a few years it seems likely that a dozen or more states will do so as well   And for one more added measure of good karma on Election Day Representative Dan Lungren nineterm Republican from California and a tired old drug warrior who backed some of the most draconian penalties against his fellow citizens was ousted from office But there remains the big question of how President Obama will handle the cannabis spring So far he and Attorney General Eric Holder have been silent I take that as a good sign and certainly a departure from the hardline position they took when California voters were considering legalization a few years ago But if they need additional nudging here are three reasons to let reason standHypocrisy Popular culture and the sportsindustrial complex would collapse without all the legal drugs that promise to extend erections reduce inhibitions and keep people awake all night Im talking to you Viagra alcohol and highpotency energy drinks Worse perhaps is the 25 billion nutritional supplement industry offerings pills that make exaggerated health claims and steroidbased hormones that can have significant bad consequences The corporate cartels behind these products get away with minimal regulation because of powerful backers like Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah  In two years through 2011 more than 2200 serious illnesses including 33 fatalities were reported by consumers of nutritional supplements Federal officials have received reports of 13 deaths and 92 serious medical events from Five Hour Energy And how many people died of marijuana ingestion Of course just because wellmarketed potentially hazardous potions are legal is no argument to bring pot onto retail shelves But its hard to make a case for fairness when one persons method of relaxation is cause for arrest while anothers lands him on a Monday night football ad Tax and regulate Already 18 states and the District of Columbia allow medical use of marijuana This chaotic and unregulated system has resulted in pricegouging phony prescriptions and outright scams No wonder the pot dispensaries have opposed legalization  it could put them out of businessWashington State officials estimate that taxation and regulation of licensed marijuana retail stores will generate 532 million in new revenue every year  Expand that number nationwide and then also add into the mix all the wasted billions now spent investigating and prosecuting marijuana cases  With pot out of the black market states can have a serious discussion about use and abuse The model is the campaign against drunk driving which has made tremendous strides and saved countless lives at a time when alcohol is easier to get than ever before Education without onesided moralizing works Lead Thats what transformative presidents do  From his years as a community organizer  and a young man whose own recreational drug use could have made him just another number in lockup  Obama knows well that racial minorities are disproportionately jailed for these crimes  With 5 percent of the worlds population the United States has 25 percent of its prisoners  and about 500000 of them are behind bars for drug offenses  On cost alone  up to 60000 a year to taxpayers per prisoner  this is unsustainableObama is uniquely suited to make the argument for change  On this issue hell have support from the libertarian right and the humanitarian left The question

NYT,http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/12/standing-and-delivering/,Linda Greenhouse on the Supreme Court and the lawIs it heretical of me or merely quirky to find myself nearly as fascinated by the procedural game the Supreme Court is playing in the samesex marriage cases as I am by the underlying merits of the two appeals the court has agreed to decide After all samesex marriage is legal in nine states and the District of Columbia and public opinion on the issue is evolving rapidly in other parts of the country with or without the  blessing of the United States Supreme Court  On the other hand the procedural minefield the court has laid around these cases may hold implications reaching well beyond the domain of gay rights   for the relationship of states to their citizens and for the balance of power between the president and Congress I say may the court never exactly a model of transparency was more than usually opaque in the orders it issued last Friday afternoon In accepting Hollingsworth v Perry the case on the constitutionality of Californias Proposition 8 prohibiting samesex marriage the justices instructed the parties to brief and argue the preliminary question whether petitioners have standing under Article III Section 2 of the Constitution in this caseAnd in United States v Windsor the challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act which bars federal recognition of samesex marriages that are valid under state law the court posed these additional questionsWhether the executive branchs agreement with the court below that DOMA is unconstitutional deprives this court of jurisdiction to decide this case and whether the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the United States House of Representatives has Article III standing in this caseTo start with whats clear about these questions Article III Section 2 is the constitutional provision that establishes the jurisdiction of the federal courts From its earliest days the Supreme Court has interpreted Article III as limiting federal jurisdiction to concrete cases ongoing disputes between parties with an actual stake in the outcome The court does not issue advisory opinions as the justices informed President George Washington whose secretary of state Thomas Jefferson had requested one on the presidents behalfThe Constitution doesnt use the word standing but the concept plays a crucial role in the determination of Article III jurisdiction In order to have standing to proceed in federal court a plaintiff must have suffered actual harm rather than have a generalized grievance the harm must have been caused by something the defendant did and the problem can actually be addressed by the decision that the plaintiff seeks These requirements are usually referred to as injuryinfact causation and redressability The standing doctrine has for years been a major site of contestation between liberal and conservative judges between those whose priority is maintaining access to court to the greatest degree possible and those who believe that the constitutional separation of powers makes the courts illsuited to resolve many of the problems that people try to bring to them Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr and the courts other conservatives are decidedly in the latter camp while the more liberal justices are somewhat less decidedly in the former The chief justice has long made it clear that he cares a lot about keeping a tight lid on standing  Standing has been an issue in the Proposition 8 case ever since the state of California decided not to appeal Federal District Judge Vaughn Walkers 2010 ruling that the proposition was unconstitutional The appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was carried on by a group of people who had worked to get the proposition adopted The Ninth Circuit questioned whether this group had the requisite Article III standing and asked the California Supreme Court to tell it whether under California law a ballot measures proponents are regarded as properly standing in the states shoes if the state decides not to defend the measure When the state court answered yes the Ninth Circuit took the answer as sufficient  and proceeded to decide the appeal finding Proposition 8 unconstitutionalWhether standing under state law translates into standing for the purposes of Article III is a question that the United States Supreme Court has poked at but never resolved Whether this is the right case in which to do so remains to be seen but it was not particularly surprising for the court to raise the issue In fact in an era of direct democracy run amok with voters being presented with extreme propositions that no rational state government would wish to embrace a Supreme Court decision on who can carry the ball into federal court is probably overdueThe justices order in the DOMA case is a different matter Here the courts concern seems to be with the fact that the Obama administration dropped its defense of the Defense of Marriage Act in February 2011 when the Windsor case was pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit The administration announced that while it would continue to apply DOMA under the presidents constitutional duty to enforce laws it now believed that statutes discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation had to meet a heightened standard of judicial scrutiny a test that it concluded DOMA would fail As required by law Attorney General Eric H Holder Jr notified Congress of the administrations decision to stop defending DOMA in court Our attorneys will also notify the courts of our interest in providing Congress a full and fair opportunity to participate in the litigation in those cases Attorney General Holder said in his letter to Representative John A Boehner the House speaker Democrats in Congress wanted no part of defending DOMA even though the statute had passed both houses in 1996 by big bipartisan majorities and was signed into law by President Bill Clinton So a fivemember House leadership body called the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group decided over the objections of its two Democratic members to take over the executive branchs abandoned defense of DOMA  The Republican members of the group bipartisan in name but not in fact hired Paul D  Clement solicitor general in the administration of President George W Bush to handle their DOMA defenseThe executive branchs abandonment of a legal position is not an everyday affair but its hardly rare Just recently Solicitor General Donald B Verrilli Jr notified the Supreme Court that the government no longer believed it was on the right side of a case on immunity for federal prison guards accused of assaulting an inmate The governments immunity position had prevailed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and the Supreme Court had agreed in September to hear the inmates appeal Millbrook v United States Now Mr Verrilli told the court last month the government was prepared to argue that the Third Circuits decision was wrong and should be overturned Taking that development in stride the justices are keeping the case on the calendar and last week appointed a private lawyer Jeffrey S Bucholtz to argue the governments abandoned positionPaul Clement himself as solicitor general informed Congress in 2004 that the government would not defend the constitutionality of a law requiring public mass transit agencies as a condition of receiving federal money to refuse to accept advertisements urging the legalization of marijuana A Federal District Court had held that the ban amounted to viewpoint discrimination prohibited by the First Amendment a decision that Mr Clement characterized as correct in his letter to the Senate legal counsel The government does not have a viable argument to advance in the statutes defense and will not appeal the district courts decision he wrote While that case never reached the Supreme Court its one example among many to show how often these issues ariseThat makes all the more puzzling the courts concern about whether it has jurisdiction in the DOMA case While the government and the plaintiff Edie Windsor may agree about the laws unconstitutionality they maintain opposite positions on whether Ms Windsor owes more than 300000 in federal estate tax on the property left to her by the woman to whom she was legally married in the eyes of New York State Had she been married to a man she would have inherited the property taxfree With DOMA barring the federal government from recognizing samesex marriage and the Obama administration taking the position that it will enforce the law until the Supreme Court or Congress tell it otherwise there certainly seems to be a controversy between the parties sufficient to meet the test of Article III jurisdiction The standing of the House Republicans to carry on the litigation seems a closer question  This socalled bipartisan group doesnt even speak for the House of Representatives let alone Congress While the group has filed friendofthecourt briefs on behalf of Congress in several cases since its creation 20 years ago its authority to stand in the executive branchs shoes as a party to a case is indistinct to say the least The court on Tuesday appointed Vicki C Jackson a Harvard law professor and an expert on federal jurisdiction to argue the positions that neither side in the Windsor case is taking that the court has no jurisdiction and that the House group has no standing Her participation promises to turn this already intriguing case into a real  to borrow a phrase  intellectual feastIf the justices find that the House group lacks standing that would be enough to make the court dismiss the case  a victory for Ms Windsor since she won in both lower courts Given the sketchiness of the groups claim to standing the question remains why the court is turning cartwheels to get at the underlying question of jurisdiction of whether the administrations agreement with the appeals court that the law is unconstitutional means that the Supreme Court has no power to decide the caseMy initial thought was that in granting the case the court was giving itself a way out in the event that it got into too much of a wrangle on the merits Under this scenario the justices would be using the jurisdictional issue as a kind of safety valve for a deeply polarized court But on reflection that theory doesnt really make sense because a finding of no jurisdiction under these circumstances would call into question the courts ability to deal with other instances of changed government positions and would be inconsistent with the action the court took just last week in the prison immunity case Further a finding of no jurisdiction would amount to a huge grant of power to the executive branch at the expense of Congress enabling the president to cut off further judicial review any time a law that he never liked in the first place is declared unconstitutional by a lower court While executive power certainly has its fans on the court including Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia Id be surprised if that sweeping proposition could capture five votesSo heres another theory about whats going on at the court and I emphasize that its just a theory I suspect there is a profound battle over the meaning of Article III jurisdiction an issue proving so divisive that the justices havent yet permitted it to fully surface There was a hint of this last term in a decision that never saw the light of day The case was First American Financial v Edwards challenging a provision of an obscure federal law the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act RESPA under which home buyers defrauded by title companies can sue for damages without needing to show that they suffered an actual financial injury While Congress indisputably conferred on these consumers the right to sue the question was whether it was a grant of standing that met the requirements of Article IIIThe case was argued in December of last year and Chief Justice Roberts assigned the opinion to Justice Clarence Thomas That was not apparent at the time to the world outside the court but it became apparent as the term went on without a decision and it was clear that Justice Thomas was the only member of the court who had not produced an opinion from the December argument sitting By late spring with the health care case pending it was easy to forget about First American Financial On June 28 the last day of the term health care decision day the court announced that it was dismissing the case as improvidently grantedWhat was the story behind this baffling never mind  All Im sure of is that there is one My guess is that Justice Thomas had drafted and circulated an opinion grounded in an extremely narrow reading of Article III jurisdiction that was so sweeping as to disable Congress from passing laws that along with granting statutory rights also give people access to court to vindicate those rights I suspect it was an opinion so radical in its implications  a kind of jurisdictional nuclear option  that Justice Thomas was unable to hold a majority and that the court remained so divided in the aftermath that no one else could put together a majority as the terms clock ran outIf Im right the First American debacle resolved nothing beyond pushing off to another day another case the battle over the dimensions of federal jurisdiction Granted this was not everyones first thought upon hearing that the Supreme Court would rule on a Defense of Marriage Act case It wasnt mine either But as I said at the beginning of this column its fascinating,2012-12-12T21:00:50Z,drugs
