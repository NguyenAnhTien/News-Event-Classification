NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/us/for-marijuana-a-second-wave-of-votes-to-legalize.html,KEIZER Ore   Two years after voters in Colorado and Washington State broke the ice as the first states to legalize sales of recreational marijuana to adults residents of Oregon Alaska and Washington DC will vote next week on ballot measures patterned on those of the two pioneers People on both sides of the issue say these initiatives could determine whether there will be a national tide of legalizationA changing political landscape has weakened antimarijuana efforts As the libertarian movement in the Republican Party has gained force with leaders like Senator Rand Paul Republican of Kentucky supporting decriminalization of marijuana and others going even further an anchor of the conservative opposition to legalization has erodedAnd Democrats have found that supporting legalization  once an invitation to be labeled soft on crime  no longer carries the risk it once did as public discussion of prison overcrowding and law enforcement budgets has reframed the issueNational groups that have long advocated legalization have provided labor and money along with help from a legal marijuana industry that did not exist in 2012 The old antidrug coalition has struggled to find traction and money Supporters of legalization have outdone opponents fundraising here in Oregon by more than 25 to 1 and in Alaska by about 9 to 1The support coalition is definitely broader and the opposition has splintered said Corey Cook an associate professor of politics at the University of San Francisco who follows the marijuana debateThe contrast between the pro and antilegalization forces was apparent on a recent day in Oregon In downtown Portland scruffy hipsters with clipboards buttonholed passersby registering voters and urging them to vote yes on Measure 91 while political consultants put the final touches on a 2 million ad barrageNearby opponents organized one of their major events in Keizer a suburb of Salem the state capital Titled Marijuana and Our Youth the session included two hours of PowerPoints and passionate denunciations of the drug But no one even mentioned Measure 91 Audience participants and organizers many of them from governmentfunded nonprofit groups involved in drug treatment services were afraid of violating laws that ban politicking with public moneyOpponents were by their own admission late in forming a united organization and their campaign had only about 10000 for advertising with spots running on two Portland radio stations starting last weekendTheyve done a pretty good job of shutting everybody up said Joshua K Marquis the district attorney in Clatsop County and an opponent of legalization referring to the pro91 forcesThe prolegalization campaigns in Oregon and Alaska are financed largely by national organizations In Alaska 84 percent of the 867000 raised by legalization proponents at Yes on Ballot Measure 2 has come from the Marijuana Policy Project a group based in Washington DC with an advisory board that includes actors musicians and politicians including Gary Johnson the Libertarian Party candidate for president in 2012 Opponents to legalization in Alaska have raised only 97000In Oregon the Drug Policy Alliance based in New York and backed by the billionaire investor George Soros has led the charge contributing at least 780000 this year according to state records making up about 35 percent of the cash raised by the main committee supporting legalizationMarijuanarelated businesses or investors in Colorado Washington and California have contributed at least 60000 Contributors included OpenVAPE a company based in Denver that sells products for consuming concentrates like hash oil Privateer Holdings a marijuana investment firm in Seattle and Vicente Sederberg which calls itself The Marijuana Law FirmThere has been some wellfunded opposition to legalization especially in Florida where voters will decide whether to become the first state in the South to allow marijuana for certain medical uses There Sheldon G Adelson a casino executive from Las Vegas has contributed 5 million to opponents of medical marijuana about 86 percent of the total raised by the main committee fighting the legislationBut in Oregon there has been no sugar daddy as Mr Marquis the county prosecutor put it Opponents have raised only about 179000Initiative 71 in Washington DC would allow residents to possess up to two ounces of marijuana for personal use and grow up to six cannabis plants at home Measure 91 in Oregon would allow possession by adults of up to eight ounces of marijuana and four plantsBallot Measure 2 in Alaska would allow adult possession of one ounce and six plantsSupporters of legalization in Oregon and Alaska said that money was crucial to overcoming what they say was years of incorrect information and distortion by law enforcement and antidrug groups about marijuanas risksThe opposition made good traction for 50 years and it was built around locking people up A massive industry was built around it said Richard Branson the entrepreneur who founded Virgin Group and a member of the Drug Policy Alliances international honorary boardOpponents said they were facing for the first time an emerging industrial complexThis is not about independent Alaskans smoking marijuana in their homes but a commercialization and industrialization of an industry said Charles Fedullo a spokesman for Big Marijuana Big Mistake which opposes Ballot Measure 2 in AlaskaChanges required for the meeting about marijuana and youth here in Keizer opponents of legalization say offers a case study in the tough new tactics of prolegalization groupsA few weeks before the Marijuana and Our Youth meeting legalization supporters pointed out to federal and state authorities that a small drug treatment center funded by government grants was sponsoring a tour of the state by Kevin A Sabet a cofounder of a national antilegalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana They reminded all parties that federal and state laws prohibited the use of public funds to influence electionsThe State of Oregon agreed and issued a stern warning that any group receiving public money  a list that included 70 counties tribes schools and nonprofit agencies that provide drug treatment or substanceabuse prevention programs  had best tread carefullyThe result was a sudden silence in the antidrug contingent and a muted meeting here in Keizer Even though private funds were substituted to avoid the appearance of impropriety talk of Measure 91 organizers said was taken off the table out of concern for jobs and future government grants A central constituency in the opposition heavy on health care professionals was stifledBoth sides said the new terrain offered a glimpse toward the next wave of states notably California where supporters are gearing up for a vote in 2016 But there are strange historical echoes too Alaska and Oregon were both pioneers of marijuana law in the 1970s Oregons Legislature debated full legalization in 1973 and ended up passing the nations first law decriminalizing possession of small amounts Alaskas Supreme Court held in 1975 that possession of marijuana in ones home was protected by constitutional privacy lawWhether the antidrug coalition of the past is dead or just sleeping both sides agree that the old arguments no longer workTodays parents are yesterdays children who were smoking marijuana and have personal experience and therefore the kind of advertisement which shows fried eggs doesnt really cut it with them Mr Soros said in an interview this year He was referring to an antidrug television campaign that showed a sizzling egg in a pan and the tagline This is your brain on drugsBut the pressure is also on proponents they say not to fall short because every new state is a kind of test caseIf we win I think it shows that public opinion has decisively changed  weve won in two election cycles said Peter Zuckerman a spokesman for New Approach Oregon the main group supporting legalization If we lose I think it becomes much harder he said We have to maintain the momentumProfessor Sabet of the department of psychiatry in the College of Medicine at the University of Florida founded his antilegalization group with Patrick J Kennedy a former Democratic congressman from Rhode Island He said an interview that on the surface the fight against legalization probably looks unwinnable hereIt looks bad  I want to be on the other team he said laughing Turning serious Professor Sabet said that experiences in Washington and Colorado were exposing flaws in legal marijuana  from greater exposure to young people to questions of highway safety  that he thinks will turn off many voters even though opponents of the ballot measures lack the money to shout their messageLegalization in practice has been the biggest enemy of legalization

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/nyregion/a-competition-to-get-a-medical-marijuana-license-in-new-york.html,More than a year before the first legal dose of marijuana will be dispensed in New York a group of entrepreneurs gathered at the Marriott Marquis hotel in Times Square in late October to discuss strategy with an influential state lawmaker It was the weekly meetup of the Cannabis and Hemp Association which formed in May to get a jump on future businessThe mood among the 18 people at the table was one of excitement Oleg Maryasis 30 a former financial adviser said he had just met with a group of investors who were eager to sink tens of millions of dollars into the New York cannabis tradeThe groups organizer Scott Giannotti a bald heavyset 35yearold from Long Island whose rsum includes selling cellphones and rapping and who now sells LED grow lights from China questioned the meetings special guest State Senator Diane J Savino Ms Savino a Democrat who represents parts of Brooklyn and Staten Island was a sponsor of the medical marijuana bill that New York passed last summer 18 years after it was first proposed her efforts led Elle magazine to name her one of its 13 most potent women in the pot industry nowSenator Mr Giannotti said what can we do to help you outMs Savino offered some cautionary words The State Health Department she said had not yet written guidelines for the medical marijuana program and the licenses available for companies keen to participate would be few and costly And she added legalized recreational use as proposed by State Senator Liz Krueger a Manhattan Democrat was unlikely any time soonStill Ms Savino called the legislation a turning point for the state and the industry We can probably take in a couple hundred million dollars a year minimally she said referring to potential tax revenue Youre going to have patients who are acclimated to medical marijuana doctors who recognize it communities who realize that if they have a dispensary its not the end of the world Then youre going to have more demand In a state this size the potential is hugeWhen Gov Andrew M Cuomo signed the Compassionate Care Act in July it gave the Health Department 18 months to come up with regulations and choose up to five companies to grow and dispense medical marijuanaNow for the states wouldbe growers private equity investors labor unions lawyers lobbyists consultants branding firms suits stoners and hucksters the rush is onThis is the moment when oldguard legalizers meet a new breed of capitalistIn October 900 people flocked to a hotel in Midtown Manhattan for a 900ahead threeday East Coast Cannabis Business Expo Educational Conference and Regulatory Summit the first of its kind in New York The events organizers were two veterans of the tanning salon business the crowd ranged from venture capitalists to chocolatiers to people currently growing illegally with a smattering of doctors and representatives of at least one nursing home conglomerate There were vendors of supplychain tracking software security services and malpractice insurance as well as a manufacturer of precisiongrade scales from the diamond district Not a single bong in the houseThis is sexy this is drugs one speaker Adam Bierman a managing partner of MedMen a Californiabased consulting company told a crowded conference room This is something theres already demand for This is selling potUnder New Yorks law licensed companies will grow and sell their own product from seed to sale Doctors can recommend but not prescribe it to treat a limited set of conditions including cancer multiple sclerosis and AIDS Though federal law still prohibits the sale and possession of marijuana the Justice Department advised its prosecutors in 2013 that if state laws to legalize the substance properly limited its spread and if companies complied with state laws they should not be prosecutedBecause banks and creditcard companies are federally regulated the purchase and sale of cannabis has so far been a cash business New Yorks health commissioner will set the price of the drug probably based on the street valueNew Yorks law is among the most restrictive to be passed by the 23 states that have legalized marijuana use in some form The 20 dispensaries set to open in a state of nearly 20 million people are likely to be highvolume centers located away from schools or houses of worship where patients or caregivers with state identification cards can get up to a months supply of nonsmokable productThe emerging industry has drawn people from unlikely precincts Patrick McCarthy a lobbyist who spent the last three years pushing legalization for cannabis companies was once an aide to Gov George E Pataki and the executive director of the New York Republican State Committee Dean Petkanas who plans to seek a state license was a chief financial officer at Stratton Oakmont the pennystock boiler room operation depicted in The Wolf of Wall Street Mr Petkanas now runs a phytomedical company called KannaLife Sciences that hopes to get FDA approval of a cannabisbased treatment for two types of brain encephalopathy At the conference he wore a pinstripe threepiece suit and spoke in torrentsI did a lot of pharmaceutical work on Wall Street when I was in boutique investment banking he said skipping over his time at Stratton Oakmont I spent a lot of time in merchant banking I really dug in hard Shares of KannaLifes parent company Medical Marijuana Inc have fallen by more than half since earlier this yearThe competition to acquire the five available licenses will be fierce and expensive Application costs alone could run to several hundred thousand dollars startup costs could top 20 million I would suggest that anyone who wants to be serious be prepared to spend at least a million dollars on an application said Evan Nison 24 a lobbyist and consultant for cannabis companies and a founder of the New York Cannabis Alliance which advocates changing the states marijuana laws Richard N Gottfried a Democratic state assemblyman from Manhattan who led the long fight to legalize medical marijuana cited an unwritten formula of government regulation When you make a statute very restrictive  and the governor did that in the last hours  you raise the stakes and create a need for more lawyers and consultants he saidOutofstate firms able to show they have run successful cannabis operations elsewhere will have an edge in the licensing process But any hope for quick profits will be limited by the small number of conditions for which New York is allowing the drugs useStill the arrival of medical marijuana opens the door to a potentially huge market said Derek Peterson 40 a former senior vice president at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Mr Peterson now heads Terra Tech a publicly traded company that already operates a fiveacre hydroponic growing facility in New Jersey turning out basil kale and other produce while awaiting the opening of more local dispensaries which Gov Chris Christie opposesWe dont love the way the New York policy works but over time the legislation can change Mr Peterson said Even if you cant make a significant profit now you can invest in it for the future He compared New York to Nevada where Terra Tech had already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to apply for a license and hired Senator Harry Reids son Rory as a lobbyist The cost of applying in New York he said might run in the high six figures Cannabis industry cash has begun to flow into New York Ms Savino said her campaign donations from outofstate growers were around 10000 or 15000  not muchThe amount of money at stake has attracted investors from across the spectrum from Wall Street to High Times magazine the 40yearold counterculture survivor that earlier this year announced that it planned to create a private equity High Times Growth Fund to invest in the cannabis businessesUnions have also claimed a share In New York all licensees will be union shops a result of two years of lobbying by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union which has also been successful in other states Cannabis is a rare growth sector for organized labor We saw around the country that these jobs had the potential to be real middleclass jobs if the workers were organized said Ed Draves a lobbyist with Bolton St Johns who led the push for the union Here in New York you saw the home health care industry develop where a lot of the workers were health care workers who couldnt attain health care or pension benefits We didnt want to see that as we developed this industryFor investors the business strikes a familiar chord with the potential for huge growth and high risk There are a lot of parallels that I draw to what happened in the technology space in the late 90s and early 2000s said Al Foreman a former managing director of JP Morgans growth equity fund Highbridge Principal Strategies Since leaving Wall Street last December Mr Foreman helped start a private equity group called Tuatara Capital that plans to invest in cannabis industries across the Americas For lack of another term Mr Foreman said its a new frontierTuatara has not yet started raising money and Mr Foreman declined to say how much it hopes to amass But he said there was already interest among investors And he added the nascent cannabis industry is ahead of where the technology sector was 20 years agoBecause people have been buying marijuana for years he said its a more easily identifiable consumer base than what you might have seen in the early days of the Internet when people were still trying to figure out how to get paying customers Were talking about an industry with real assets and markets where there is existing demandMr Foreman noted that the cultural gap between Wall Street and the purveyors of products like Ghost Train Haze and Holy Grail Kush is not what it once was Money changes everything When I took a trip to Denver to walk the halls and the plants and the factories you realize that these are not kids in the basement he said The stereotype is shattered by the level of professionalism Some of these companies will grow into really large companiesHigh Times hopes to grow with them said Michael Kennedy its controlling owner Mr Kennedy a criminal lawyer who at the magazines inception represented its founder in an investigation into smuggling charges said High Times was close to launching its private equity fund with two partners  so close that he would not discuss previously disclosed details for fear of violating government rules against soliciting business ahead of a launch An interview with Mr Kennedy published by Bloomberg Businessweek in June cited a target of 300 million for the fundOn a recent day Malcolm MacKinnon the magazines silverhaired editor presided over a staff of more than two dozen with ages ranging from their 20s to their 60s as they worked quietly on the February issue the cover story a showdown between cannabis sativa and cannabis indica Professionally Mr MacKinnon uses the pseudonym Dan Skye an artifact from less cannabisfriendly times when he was raising children and coaching Little LeagueWith its runofthemill cubicles the office felt more like the law firm that shares space with the magazine than the partying High Times suggested by its pages Asked whether the staff smoked in the office Mr MacKinnon replied with a note of sarcasm Gee we wouldnt do that because its illegalThe private equity fund continues the magazines efforts to merge with the mainstream These days High Times organizes a sprawling trade show and smokeoff called the Cannabis Cup Once limited to a single annual event in Amsterdam where competitors vied to provide the most potent herb the Cannabis Cup is now a domestic affair that draws tens of thousands of attendees to multiple locations Versions were held in five cities in the United States this year with speakers and vendors of everything a contemporary cannabis consumer might fancy except in some places cannabisHigh Times is now a legacy business with four decades of experience in a field many are just entering Mr MacKinnon saidEverybody wants to talk to us nowThat group may include people like Ari Hoffnung 40 who hopes to get one of the New York licenses He named his fledgling company Fiorello Pharmaceuticals Inc in tribute to New York mayor Fiorello H LaGuardia who opposed the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 when the substance was still legal For now Mr Hoffnung has formed an investor group while seeking to forge partnerships with companies that have grown and dispensed marijuana in other statesMr Hoffnung is a former managing director at Bear Stearns and was a deputy comptroller when John C Liu served as the city comptroller He said he became interested in medical marijuana after seeing folks in my family with ALS and other conditions where cannabis has been proven helpful to relieve pain and sufferingBut he had another interest in legal cannabis While working for Mr Liu he took part in a study that asked how many city residents might benefit from the legalization of marijuana and how much money the city might reap The numbers were big 100000 patients for medical cannabis and tax revenue of 400 million if recreational use were legalizedThe figures Mr Hoffnung acknowledged will not be realized until well into the future if ever But the current regulatory conditions with each state setting its own laws and no distribution across state lines might be an advantage for smaller companies like hisNo major companies want to create a business model and have to replicate it in 23 states he said That doesnt allow economies of scaleThat could change especially as businesses press state and federal legislators harder In New York the public is already on board said Mr McCarthy the lobbyist citing polls that show support for medical marijuana at 83 percent in the state up from just 58 percent a few years ago The support he said is widespread Theres no drop off from a senior in Buffalo to an independent soccer mom in SuffolkIn the meantime at the Cannabis and Hemp Association meeting the aspiring moguls had a regulatory request for Ms Savino They wanted more regulation not less Specifically Mr Giannotti worried about overthecounter remedies being sold as nonpsychoactive hemp oil or CBD oil CBD or cannabidiol is one of the active ingredients in cannabis Such products are largely unregulated and sell for as much as hundreds of dollars for a small amount The attendees worried that such companies might taint the industry Could the state crack down on themMs Savino pulled a bottle of something called Green Cures CBD Oil from her purse eying it skeptically People believe what they want to believe she said Its hard to protect people from what they think will helpMr Maryasis said he hoped the overthecounter products which were plentiful at the recent trade show were not a sign of things to come especially before regulated medical marijuana becomes availableThis sets a bad standard for the industry he said We want to lead with genuineness and not just opportunismHe added If we do this right we can be an example to the nation We dont have to be the first ones to legalize it We just have to do it right,2014-11-02T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/01/us/politics/ap-us-rethinking-pot-driving-stoned.html,WASHINGTON   As states liberalize their marijuana laws public officials and safety advocates worry that more drivers high on pot will lead to a big increase in traffic deaths Researchers though are divided on the questionStudies of marijuanas effects show that the drug can slow decisionmaking decrease peripheral vision and impede multitasking all of which are critical driving skills But unlike with alcohol drivers high on pot tend to be aware that they are impaired and try to compensate by driving slowly avoiding risky actions such as passing other cars and allowing extra room between vehiclesOn the other hand combining marijuana with alcohol appears to eliminate the pot smokers exaggerated caution and seems to increase driving impairment beyond the effects of either substance aloneWe see the legalization of marijuana in Colorado and Washington as a wakeup call for all of us in highway safety said Jonathan Adkins executive director of Governors Highway Safety Association which represents state highway safety officesWe dont know enough about the scope of marijuanaimpaired driving to call it a big or small problem But anytime a driver has their ability impaired it is a problemColorado and Washington are the only states that allow retail sales of marijuana for recreational use Efforts to legalize recreational marijuana are underway in Alaska Massachusetts New York Oregon and the District of Columbia Twentythree states and the nations capital permit marijuana use for medical purposesIt is illegal in all states to drive while impaired by marijuanaColorado Washington and Montana have set an intoxication threshold of 5 parts per billion of THC the psychoactive ingredient in pot in the blood A few other states have set intoxication thresholds but most have not set a specific level In Washington there was a jump of nearly 25 percent in drivers testing positive for marijuana in 2013  the first full year after legalization  but no corresponding increase in car accidents or fatalitiesWhat worries highway safety experts are cases like that of New York teenager Joseph Beer who in October 2012 smoked marijuana climbed into a Subaru Impreza with four friends and drove more than 100 mph before losing control The car crashed into trees with such force that the vehicle split in half killing his friendsBeer pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicular homicide and was sentenced last week to 5 years to 15 years in prisonA prosecutor blamed the crash on speed and weed but a Yale University Medical School expert on drug abuse who testified at the trial said studies of marijuana and crash risk are highly inconclusive Some studies show a two or threefold increase while others show none said Dr Mehmet Sofuoglu Some studies even showed less risk if someone was marijuana positive he testifiedTeenage boys and young men are the most likely drivers to smoke pot and the most likely drivers to have an accident regardless of whether theyre high he saidBeing a teenager a male teenager and being involved in reckless behavior could explain both at the same time  not necessarily marijuana causing getting into accidents but a general reckless behavior leading to both conditions at the same time he told jurorsIn 2012 just over 10 percent of high school seniors said they had smoked pot before driving at least once in the prior two weeks according to Monitoring the Future an annual University of Michigan survey of 50000 middle and high school students Nearly twice as many male students as female students said they had smoked marijuana before drivingA roadside survey by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2007 found 86 percent of drivers tested positive for THC but its not possible to say how many were high at the time because drivers were tested only for the presence of drugs not the amountA marijuana high generally peaks within a half hour and dissipates within three hours but THC can linger for days in the bodies of habitual smokersInexperienced pot smokers are likely to be more impaired than habitual smokers who develop a tolerance Some studies show virtually no driving impairment in habitual smokersTwo recent studies that used similar data to assess crash risk came to opposite conclusionsColumbia University researchers compared drivers who tested positive for marijuana in the roadside survey with state drug and alcohol tests of drivers killed in crashes They found that marijuana alone increased the likelihood of being involved in a fatal crash by 80 percentBut because the study included states where not all drivers are tested for alcohol and drugs a majority of drivers in fatal crashes were excluded possibly skewing the results Also the use of urine tests rather than blood tests in some cases may overestimate marijuana use and impairmentA Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation study used the roadside survey and data from nine states that test more than 80 percent of drivers killed in crashes When adjusted for alcohol and driver demographics the study found that otherwise sober drivers who tested positive for marijuana were slightly less likely to have been involved in a crash than drivers who tested negative for all drugsWe were expecting a huge impact said Eduardo Romano lead author of the study and when we looked at the data from crashes were not seeing that much But Romano said his study may slightly underestimate the risk and that marijuana may lead to accidents caused by distractionMany states do not test drivers involved in a fatal crash for drugs unless there is reason to suspect impairment Even if impairment is suspected if the driver tests positive for alcohol there may be no further testing because alcohol alone may be enough to bring criminal charges Testing procedures also vary from state to stateIf states legalize marijuana they must set clear limits for impairment behind the wheel and require mandatory drug testing following a crash said Deborah Hersman former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board Right now we have a patchwork system across the nation regarding mandatory drug testing following highway crashes___OnlineNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration marijuana fact sheet

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/opinion/alaska-oregon-and-the-district-of-columbia-should-legalize-pot.html,The decision by California voters in 1996 to legalize medical marijuana produced a wave of similar initiatives around the country Less than two decades later over half the states allow at least limited medical use Now it looks as though recreational use of the drug may follow the same pathIn 2012 Washington State and Colorado legalized recreational marijuana This November voters in Alaska Oregon and the District of Columbia will decide whether to do the same  effectively disregarding the misguided federal ban on a drug that is far less dangerous than alcohol Decades of arresting people for buying selling and using marijuana have hurt more than helped society and minority communities have been disproportionately affected by the harsh criminal penalties of prohibitionSince Alaska Oregon and the District of Columbia already allow medical marijuana taking the next step makes good sense There are some differences in their proposed initiatives but they are all worthy of passageALASKA Ballot Measure 2 would make the use and purchase of marijuana legal for those 21 and older create a marijuana control board and tax the drug at 50 per ounce wholesale It is already legal for Alaskans to possess small amounts of marijuana in their homes and surveys indicate that 18 percent of Alaskans smoke marijuana Ballot Measure 2 would mean that Alaskans could buy it from a store instead of resorting to the black marketOREGON Measure 91 would also set a minimum age of 21 It would give the Oregon Liquor Control Commission the power to regulate marijuana as it does alcohol and would direct it to review tax rates regularly The tax  initially set at 35 per ounce for flowers and 10 per ounce for leaves  should allow for prices low enough to compete with street dealers Since it is already extremely easy for adults in Oregon to obtain medical marijuana cards almost 65000 Oregonians have one recreational legalization will not be a big change As  The Oregonian editorialized in August the measure would be worth supporting for reasons of honesty and convenience aloneDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA Initiative 71 would repeal all criminal and civil penalties for personal possession of marijuana and allow limited private cultivation of the drug People 21 and older could grow up to six plants at home and give away up to one ounce Because the District of Columbia Home Rule Act does not allow a tax to be imposed by referendum Initiative 71 would not set up a mechanism for regulating retail sales of the drugOpponents of legalization warn that states are embarking on a risky experiment But the sky over Colorado has not fallen and prohibition has proved to be a complete failure Its time to bring the marijuana market out into the open and end the injustice of arrests and convictions that have devastated communitiesCareful regulation of the drug could very well make it safer to consume and proper taxation could bring in new revenue for states This year from January through June Colorado collected about 189 millionIdeally the federal government would repeal the ban on marijuana so states could set their own policies without worrying about the possibility of a crackdown on citizens violating federal law Even though a majority of Americans favor legalization Congress shows no sign of budging So its better for the states to take the lead than to wait for an epiphany on Capitol Hill that may never come,2014-10-06T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/us/politics/medical-marijuana-research-hits-the-wall-of-federal-law.html,Nearly four years ago Dr Sue Sisley a psychiatrist at the University of Arizona sought federal approval to study marijuanas effectiveness in treating military veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder She had no idea how difficult it would beThe proposal which has the support of veterans groups was hung up at several regulatory stages requiring the researchs private sponsor to resubmit multiple times After the proposed study received final approval in March from federal health officials the lone federal supplier of research marijuana said it did not have the strains the study needed and would have to grow more  potentially delaying the project until at least early next yearThen in June the university fired Dr Sisley later citing funding and reorganization issues But Dr Sisley is convinced the real reason was her outspoken support for marijuana researchThey could never get comfortable with the idea of this controversial highprofile research happening on campus she saidDr Sisleys case is an extreme example of the obstacles and frustrations scientists face in trying to study the medical uses of marijuana Dating back to 1999 the Department of Health and Human Services has indicated it does not see much potential for developing marijuana in smoked form into an approved prescription drug In guidelines issued that year for research on medical marijuana the agency quoted from an accompanying report that stated If there is any future for marijuana as a medicine it lies in its isolated components the cannabinoids and their synthetic derivativesScientists say this position has had a chilling effect on marijuana researchThough more than one million people are thought to use the drug to treat ailments ranging from cancer to seizures to hepatitis C and chronic pain there are few rigorous studies showing whether the drug is a fruitful treatment for those or any other conditionsA major reason is this The federal government categorizes marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug the most restrictive of five groups established by the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 Drugs in this category  including heroin LSD peyote and Ecstasy  are considered to have no accepted medical use in the United States and a high potential for abuse and are subject to tight restrictions on scientific studyIn the case of marijuana those restrictions are even greater than for other controlled substances Marijuana remains illegal under federal law though nearly half the states and the District of Columbia allow its medical use and two Colorado and Washington have legalized its recreational useTo obtain the drug legally researchers like Dr Sisley must apply to the Food and Drug Administration the Drug Enforcement Administration and the National Institute on Drug Abuse  which citing a 1961 treaty obligation administers the only legal source of the drug for federally sanctioned research at the University of Mississippi Dr Sisleys proposed study also had to undergo an additional layer of review from the Public Health Service that is not required for other controlled substances in such researchThe process is so cumbersome that a growing number of elected state officials medical experts and members of Congress have started calling for loosening the restrictions In June a letter signed by 30 members of Congress including four Republicans called the extra scrutiny of marijuana projects unnecessary saying that research has often been hampered by federal barriersIt defies logic in this day and age that marijuana is still in Schedule 1 alongside heroin and LSD when there is so much testimony to what relief medical marijuana can bring Gov Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island said in an interview In late 2011 he and the governor of Washington at the time Christine O Gregoire filed a petition asking the federal government to place the drug in a lower category The petition is still pending with the DEADespite the mounting push there is little evidence that either Congress or the Obama administration will change marijuanas status soon In public statements DEA officials have made their displeasure known about states legalizing medical and recreational marijuanaThe agencys position seems at odds with that of President Obama whose Justice Department has allowed states to legalize either medical or recreational marijuana as long as they follow certain federal priorities such as not allowing sales to juveniles Mr Obama has also said that he believes marijuana is no more dangerous than alcohol and that he is bothered by the disproportionate number of minorities incarcerated for possession of the drugAsked if there was an inconsistency between the presidents stance and that of the Drug Enforcement Administration a White House spokesman Matt Lehrich said The administrations policy continues to be that while the prosecution of drug traffickers remains an important priority targeting individual marijuana users is not the best allocation of federal law enforcement resources The DEA is carrying out that policyThere are signs though of a possible shift in attitude within the federal government In May the DEA issued new rules to increase the governments production of marijuana for research this year to 650000 grams from 21000 gramsAnd at the National Institute on Drug Abuse for instance records show that at the beginning of this year there were 28 active grants for research into the possible medical benefits of marijuana in six disease categoriesMost of the studies focus on the potential therapeutic uses of individual cannabinoid chemicals from marijuana or synthetic versions and not the plant itself Furthermore a dozen or so of those studies are being conducted with animals and not humansAdditionally other National Institutes of Health entities have been supporting marijuana research As for independently funded marijuana research the federal government has cleared 16 projects since 1999 13 of them at the University of California San DiegoMoving the drug to a less restrictive category could do more than reduce some obstacles to research proponents say It would be a significant step toward allowing doctors around the country to prescribe the drug Federal lawmakers say it could also permit medical marijuana operations that are legal at the state level to take business deductions on their federal taxesDr Sisleys predicament shows that even in states like Arizona where medical marijuana is legal the matter remains politically volatile Last month Arizona authorized the use of marijuana for patients undergoing conventional treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder Dr Sisleys study is supposed to use five different strains of marijuana that would be smoked or vaporized by 70 veterans The goal is to develop a marijuana drug in plant form that would be smoked or vaporized approved by the Food and Drug AdministrationHer firing seemed to stem from a fight over money In March the Arizona House passed a Republicansponsored bill designed to provide her project with some funding from fees collected in the states medical marijuana program But the measure died when State Senator Kimberly Yee a Republican who is the chairwoman of the Education Committee refused to put the legislation on the panels agenda Ms Yee said at the time that she preferred the funds be used for antidrug educationAngry about her opposition to the bill a group of veterans began a recall effort against Ms Yee Some of those veterans had been treated by Dr Sisley in the past and Senate leaders concluded that Dr Sisley herself was involved in the campaignThe State Senate president Andrew Biggs called the universitys chief lobbyist Tim Bee to complain that Dr Sisley seemed to be lobbying too aggressively and inappropriately Tim said he would call me back after he found out more Mr Biggs said in an interview And then he did and told me This will not be a problem going forwardIn April a university vice president who said he was calling on behalf of the president Ann Weaver Hart told Dr Sisley that Mr Biggs thought she should resign Dr Sisley recounted In June she received a letter from the university saying her annual employment contract would not be renewed as of Sept 26Dr Sisley denied participating in the recall effort She acknowledged talking to senators and their aides about funding but as a member of the Arizona Medical Association The university could not take the political heat from the hyperconservative legislators and fired me and deserted all these veterans who have been fighting alongside me for years she saidA university spokesman Chris W Sigurdson said that while university policy prevented him from discussing specifics about Dr Sisleys case the school had not been pressured to fire her Mr Biggs also denied trying to get her fired He added that the university had proposed that another faculty member take over the project as lead investigatorLate last month the university notified Dr Sisley that it had denied her appeal for reinstatement Rick Doblin founder and executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies which is sponsoring Dr Sisleys research said he would now try to persuade the Arizona Board of Regents to allow the study to continue at another state institute with Dr Sisley as the lead investigatorMr Doblin said he was committed to staying with her as the lead investigator and would help her look for an alternate research location A switch to a new study location would require further regulatory review for the proposed research which still needs another approval from the DEA Mr Doblin

NYT,http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/a-nation-in-transition-investigating-evolving-research-and-policy-on-marijuana/,Marijuana is illegal in the United States Yet 35 states and the District of Columbia permit some form of marijuana consumption for medical purposes and as of this year two states now allow its recreational use As national policy evolves on this issue the New York Times editorial board this summer published a  sixpart series calling for legalization In this lesson we pull together those opinion pieces as well as many other Times articles graphics and videos to offer starting points for science social studies and English teachers aiming to use the debate as an opportunity for learning research and discussion  Are you teaching this topic How What have we missedThe Natural History of MarijuanaLike other crops marijuana is largely cultivated  legally and illegally  in greenhousetype grow houses and on farms And like other crops marijuana comes from a plant  cannabis originally found in the wild and cultivated over thousands of years Have students research the history of cannabis from its origins in South and Central Asia to its introduction to the Americas  How have people used the different parts of the plant throughout history Then have students work in groups to annotate a map of the world tracing the history of marijuana cultivation This Is Your Brain  and Body  on DrugsMarijuana is best known for its psychoactive properties But how does marijuana bring about these sensations and how else does it behave in the body To answer these questions students might research how the active compounds in marijuana affect the body at the level of the cell and draw parallels with how other drugs act in the body  As is the case with many other drugs  from legal overthecounter medications to illegal street drugs like heroin  the active compounds interact with locations on the surfaces of cells called receptors Cell surface receptors provide a means for cells to receive information and input from the environment when a molecule attaches or binds to a cell surface receptor it triggers a series of events inside the cell like the release of hormones neurotransmitters or other molecules A discussion about marijuanas effects on the body might dovetail nicely with a broader class discussion or review of cell biology the makeup and function of the cell membrane and the function of neurotransmitters To dive a little deeper explain that cells in the human body have receptors for the active compounds in marijuana collectively referred to as cannabinoids By binding to cannabinoid receptors cannabinoid molecules affect how cells release chemical messengers called neurotransmitters The human body naturally makes cannabinoids and the main active ingredients in marijuana mimic these molecules and can therefore bind to the same receptors This might help to explain some of the effects marijuana is reported to have not just on the brain but on other body systems as well With this background in place have students research some of the conditions and disorders marijuana is reported to help What evidence do scientists use to support the idea that marijuana may help these and other conditions What kind of additional evidence about the beneficial effects of marijuana do scientists need and how do they suggest better using marijuana in ways that best help patients Medical Marijuana and ChildrenReview the two active compounds in marijuana THC and cannabidiol CBD and talk about how selective breeding techniques can produce strains of marijuana with varying amounts of these compounds Why might it be important for marijuana used in a therapeutic setting to have a low level of THC  Then watch both of these brief videos Healing Hemp and Pediatric Pot Which of the two active compounds has shown promise in treating children with seizures What are some of the barriers to making this compound more widely accessible What do scientists still need to learn about how this compound works Why arent there more studies of promising applications for medical marijuana Use these videos as a springboard for a discussion about using medical marijuana in young people What do its proponents have to say What are some of the main arguments against it  The Risks of Marijuana UseWhat does medical science have to say about the risks associated with marijuana use compared with the legal but regulated substances tobacco and alcohol The illegal substances cocaine and heroin Students might compare these risks using a chart or other simple graphic organizer What are gateway drugs and why might it be time to revisit the claim that marijuana use predicts harder drug use  What does medical science also have to say about the potential health benefits of marijuanaAt the same time what new information about the developing teenage brain suggests that recreational marijuana use in places where it has been legalized should be prohibited for minors Students might read further about marijuana and the teenage brain like these studies suggesting actual structural changes in the brains of young people who regularly use marijuanaAs students read and work you might have them annotate diagrams of the human body and brain highlighting the various systems affected by marijuana and the effect marijuana has on these systems The History of Marijuana ProhibitionIf marijuana is now considered to have valid medicinal purposes by the scientific community and if marijuana is less dangerous than the highly addictive but perfectly legal substances known as alcohol and tobacco how did the federal government come to categorize it as a Schedule I drug  in the same class of drugs as the highly addictive heroin and more harmful than the Schedule II drug cocaine Students can research the evolving history of attitudes and policy toward marijuana in the United States As a starting point they can read about the role that prejudice and stereotypes and a general fear of Mexican immigrants and AfricanAmericans played in formulating federal policy toward marijuana They can also consult this timeline of marijuana use in the United States and this article on the origins of the term marijuana Evaluating the War on DrugsMarijuana policy has affected millions of lives From 2001 to 2010 the police made 82 million marijuana arrests In 2011 there were more arrests for marijuana possession than for all violent crimes put together And those arrests disproportionately affect AfricanAmericans even though blacks and whites use marijuana at similar rates In states like Iowa Minnesota and Illinois blacks are more than seven times as likely to get arrested as whites for marijuana offenses Nationally blacks are 37 times as likely Arrests often lead to jail time and they can affect employment education and even the ability to get a bank loan Beyond the racial imbalance some nonviolent offenders are spending decades in jail for marijuana possession while in other states marijuana entrepreneurs are getting rich Students can study the consequences of the war on marijuana Who is most affected How are they affected How much does the war cost And what are the results They can start with Jesse Wegmans editorial on the injustice of marijuana arrests and look at this American Civil Liberties Union multimedia presentationDebating Public PolicyCurrent federal law states that marijuana like all other Schedule I drugs has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States Yet 35 states and the District of Columbia permit some form of marijuana consumption for medical purposes And two Colorado and Washington now allow recreational use of marijuana with more states considering a similar move With such radical inconsistency between federal and state law the country is ripe for a national rethinking of its marijuana policy Students can hold a mock Congress or simulate a state legislative session to debate whether marijuana should be removed from the Controlled Substances Act or whether their state should legalize marijuana for medical or recreational use or both Should states treat marijuana like alcohol  regulating and taxing it while banning its use by minors To do their research they can read David Firestones argument in favor of letting the states decide just as states did regarding alcoholic beverages after the end of Prohibition in 1933 Then students can seek out additional evidence on both sides of the debate and determine their own states policy toward marijuana  After their discussion they can write a policy paper advocating a position or simply answer our Student Opinion question Should Marijuana Be LegalIf students want to delve deeper they can investigate Colorados legalization experiment along with some of the early bumps on the road and the finer details of marijuana regulation  This resource may be used to address the academic standards

NYT,http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/marijuana-teens-health-risks/,When the antidrug educator Tim Ryan talks to students he often asks them what they know about marijuana Its a plant is a common responseBut more recently the answer has changed Now they reply Its legal in ColoradoThese are confusing times for middle and high school students who for most of their young lives have been lectured about the perils of substance abuse particularly marijuana Now it seems that the adults in their lives have done an aboutfaceRecreational marijuana is legal in Colorado and in Washington and many other states have approved it for medical use Lawmakers the news media and even parents are debating the merits of fullscale legalizationThey are growing up in a generation where marijuana used to be bad and maybe now its not bad said Mr Ryan a senior prevention specialist with FCD Educational Services an antidrug group that works with students in the classroomTheir parents are telling them not to do it but they may be supporting legalization of it at the same timeAntidrug advocates say efforts to legalize marijuana have created new challenges as they work to educate teenagers and their parents about the unique risks that alcohol marijuana and other drugs pose to the developing teenage brainThese educators say their goal is not to vilify marijuana or take a stand on legalization instead they say their role is to convince young people and their parents that the use of drugs is not just a moral or legal issue but a significant health issueThe health risks are real said Steve Pasierb the chief executive of the Partnership for DrugFree Kids Every passing year science unearths more health risks about why any form of substance use is unhealthy for young peopleAlready nearly half of teenagers  44 percent  have tried marijuana at least once according to data from the partnership Regular use is less common One in four teenagers report using marijuana in the past month and 7 percent report frequent use  at least 20 times in the past monthEven in the states where marijuana is legal it remains like alcohol offlimits to anyone younger than 21 But the reality is that once a product becomes legal it becomes much easier for underage users to obtain itThis summer the Partnership for DrugFree Kids released its annual tracking study in which young people were asked what stopped them from trying drugs Getting into trouble with the law and disappointing their parents were cited as the two most common reason young people did not use marijuana The concern now is that legalization will remove an important mental barrier that keeps adolescents from trying marijuana at a young ageMaking it legal makes it much more accessible more available said Dr Nora Volkow the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse This is the reality so what we need to do is to prevent the damage or at least minimize it as much as possibleDrug prevention experts say the Just Say No approach of the 1980s does not work The goal of parents should not be to prevent their kids from ever trying marijuanaInstead the focus should be on practical reasons to delay use of any mindaltering substance including alcohol until they are olderThe reason is that young brains continue to develop until the early 20s and young people who start using alcohol or marijuana in their teens are far more vulnerable to longterm substanceabuse problemsThe brain is still wiring itself during adolescence and marijuana  or any drug use  during this period essentially trains the reward system to embrace a mindaltering chemicalWe know that 90 percent of adults who are addicted began use in teenage years Mr Pasierb said They programmed the reward and drive center of their teenage brain that this is one of those things that rewards and drives me like food does like sex doesStudies in New Zealand and Canada have found that marijuana use in the teenage years can result in lost IQ points Mr Pasierb says the current generation of young people are high achievers and are interested in the scientific evidence about how substance use can affect intelligenceYou have to focus on brain maturation he said This generation of kids wants good brains they want to get into better schools Talk to a junior or senior about whether marijuana use shaves a couple points off their SATs and they will listen to youBecause early exposure to marijuana can change the trajectory of brain development even a few years of delaying use in the teen years is better Research shows that young adults who smoked pot regularly before the age of 16 performed significantly worse on cognitive function tests than those who started smoking in their later teenage yearsDrug educators say that one benefit of the legalization talk is that it may lead to more research on the health effects of marijuana on young people and more funding for antidrug campaignsThe Partnership for DrugFree Kids plans to continue its Above the Influence marketing campaign which studies show has been an effective way of reaching teenagers about the risks of drug use The campaign does not target a specific drug but it teaches parents and teens about the health effects of early drug use and tries to empower teens to make good choicesLegalization is going to make the work we do even more relevant Mr Pasierb said Its part of the changing drug landscape,2014-08-18T17:46:42Z,drugs

intense getoutthevote drives are mobilizing in Oregon and Alaska to legalize retail sales of marijuana to anyone old enough to drinkBut backers of the legalpot ballot measures in both states have a challenge that their predecessors in Colorado and Washington state didnt face two years ago  increasing turnout of young voters in a midterm electionYoung voters who as a generation are more likely to support recreational marijuana usually turn out during presidential years like 2012 but stay home during midterms when the electorate skews older and more conservativeIf young people 18 to 29 years old vote like they did in 2012 Oregons Measure 91 for example would pass said Ethan Nadelmann head of Drug Policy Action a major contributor in the national campaign to legalize marijuanaThats really what it boils down to he saidWashington DC is voting on whether to make it legal to possess marijuana but not sell itWhatever happens in the states and the nations capital advocates plan to quickly shift their attention to the 2016 presidential elections and the big prize California where hopes are high for approval of legal pot despite a 2010 rejectionEven if all those things go down to defeat I still think its a clean slate in 2016 said Jeffrey Miron an economist at Harvard University and the Cato Institute who follows national drug policyMark Kleiman a drug policy consultant who helped Washington set up its legal marijuana industry said the outcomes in Oregon and Alaska will help determine the enthusiasm of funders financing the legalization campaign in CaliforniaIn the meantime the focus is on Oregon and AlaskaOregon is a blue state that decriminalized marijuana in 1973 and authorized medical marijuana in 1998The states southwestern corner is renowned for growing some of the nations best marijuana and attracts outlaw growers from the US and Mexico Medical pot dispensaries were approved last year to sell to nearly 70000 patientsAlaska by contrast is more conservative but theres a strong libertarian streak and small amounts of marijuana have been legal for personal use since a 1975 state Supreme Court ruling Medical pot is legal but not dispensariesBoth states have seen previous initiatives to legalize marijuana fail This time around campaigns have major contributions from outofstate donors who want see the legal pot movement garner more victoriesIn Alaska supporters of Measure 2 have raised more than 890000 nearly all of it from the Marijuana Policy Project the largest federal spender on marijuana advocacy Opponents have raised nearly 150000Despite the difference the no campaign  Big Marijuana Big Mistake  is not giving up relying heavily on volunteers social media letters to the editor and word of mouthMore and more Alaskans are donating to the no campaign said spokeswoman Deborah Williams Theyre convinced we need to defeat this measure And we will win this measureIn Oregon two groups backing Measure 91 have raised a total of nearly 4 million most of it spent on TV ads Opponents have raised 168000In the state where elections are settled exclusively by mail ballots closing the deal means a twostep process said Liz Kaufman campaign director for Yes on 91 People need to mark their ballots and then turn them inThe campaign is reaching out with TV phone trees doortodoor canvassing chalking on college campuses and a Facebook app that lets people track whether their friends have voted and nag them until they doYoud be surprised how many people mark up their ballots and dont turn them in Kaufman saidThe Facebook app didtheyvoteorg has been around since the 2012 election and is available to anyone campaigning in Oregon said Ben Unger of Our Oregon a nonpartisan getoutthevote organization It is especially effective in votebymail states like Oregon where people get their ballots weeks before election dayWhile other campaigns are using it the Yes on 91 campaign has dived in with both feet Former Portland Mayor Sam Adams sent out an email blast urging people to use it and phone bank volunteers finish their shifts with a round of nudging their Facebook friends campaign spokesman Peter Zuckerman saidIn Alaska a recent poll for initiative proponents shows overwhelming support among voters under 35 with the measure winning by 18 points Another for opponents shows it losing by 10 pointsIts a very polarized race said Anchorage pollster Ivan Moore who conducted the poll for the initiative sponsor Young people like it and old people dont And the trouble for the yes side is that old people vote and young people dontAnother key demographic is mothersWith only 168000 to spend the Noon91 campaign in Oregon used most of it to mail 155000 postcards to mothers from Portland to Eugene It focused on fears that

he said Weve got daytime jobs The potheads dont This is their job to get this legalizedPolls in Oregon have shown support for legalization declining as election day approaches but still with a fair

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/18/world/americas/ap-lt-brazil-conservatives-rise.html,RIO DE JANEIRO   With its Carnival reputation and skinbaring beach life Brazil may look like a liberal bastion But unease over a worsening economy and deteriorating public safety plus a backlash against recent gayrights gains are propelling a conservative rise that will shape the next administration regardless of who wins the presidencyThe general election held earlier this month saw a greater share of Brazils National Congress seats go to various conservative caucuses which now control nearly 60 percent of the 513 seats in the lower house They include evangelical lawmakers who oppose gay marriage or access to abortion the ruralistas whose proagriculture positions counter environmentalists and indigenous groups and a lawandorder faction that demands a crackdown on crimeAhead of the presidential runoff Oct 26 theres no doubt such conservatives are giving greater support to centerright challenger Aecio Neves over leftleaning President Dilma Rousseff But its also clear that neither presidential candidate is as socially conservative as the increasingly powerful elements of CongressBrazil is one of the very few Latin American countries where the parliament is more important than the president in terms of overall power in the decisionmaking process said Thiago de Aragao a political analyst for the Brasiliabased Arko Advice consulting firm The parliament in an armwrestling contest against the presidency would win  because the parliaments main weapon is just crossing their arms and not voting on matters that are of strong interest to the governmentDespite its anythinggoes appearance Brazil is like many predominantly Roman Catholic nations in Latin America socially conservative In recent opinion polls for example more than 80 percent of Brazilians said they oppose loosening their restrictive abortion laws or legalizing marijuana and just over half oppose gay marriageHowever since Brazils return to democracy in 1985 the nations presidents and its judiciary have pushed through progressive projects either by decree or rulings  such as protecting huge swaths of jungle as indigenous reserves a highcourt ruling permitting samesex civil unions and the creation of Bolsa Familia a program that gives monthly cash payments to Brazils poorest familiesSome predict such changes could be rolled back by the growing conservative forcesThe evangelical caucus votes in lockstep on hotbutton social issues and is willing to block projects put forth by the presidency because its members know they represent a growing segment of the electorate While Catholics remain the majority in Brazil since 1970 their portion of the population has fallen from more than 90 percent to 65 percent while those identifying as Protestants have grown from 5 percent to 22 percent according to the Pew Research CenterIn Rousseffs first term the evangelical caucus blocked her effort to promote gaytolerance teaching in schools and managed to have their most outspoken antigay legislator Deputy Marco Feliciano named head of the bodys human rights commission  a move that provoked condemnation from Amnesty International and other activist groups In the Oct 5 election Feliciano was reelected to his Sao Paulo district with nearly double the votes he won four years agoThe ruralista caucus also grew and now has about 200 members who support its agenda These lawmakers showed their strength in 2012 forcing weakening of environmental protection laws which critics say contributed to a 29 percent jump in the number of Amazon acres deforested over the last yearAnd while the lawandorder block is small with only about 20 members it wields influence on security issues The caucus members defend tougher penal codes for young offenders and want to block the sort of drug liberalization seen in neighboring countries even as Brazil copes with overcrowded prisons and years of failed efforts to suppress powerful drug gangsBut its the evangelical lawmakers who are at the heart of Brazils growing conservatism and theyve shown an ability to rally the other groups behind their main cause defeating any attempt to legalize gay marriage or advance protections for LGBT communitiesToni Reis who heads the gay rights advocacy group Dignidade noted it took a landmark Supreme Court decision to legalize samesex civil unions in 2011 following years of congressional stalling on the matter Now he said gay rights groups are focused not on gay marriage but on advancing legislation to criminalize discrimination against gaysGiven the new legislative reality Reis acknowledged it will be an uphill battleWere going to have to work twice as hard he saidJean Wyllys Brazils first openly gay congressman said progressive lawmakers wont give upTheres no doubt its going to be more difficult said Wyllys who represents Rio de Janeiro state But I also have my allies  We are a political force capable of blocking their the evangelicals legislative projectsBut Brazils most influential evangelical pastor Silas Malafaia who campaigned for several Pentecostal politicians says the conservatives dont intend to impose stances out of step with the electorateI am against gay marriage Lets hold a referendum and let society decide Malafaia said in an interview If the people decide that they want abortions to be legalized I will always be against it but I will respect those decisions Were not evangelical extremists trying to impose what we think with an iron fist___Associated Press writer Brad Brooks contributed to this report___,2014-10-18T00:00:33Z,drugs

whether to legalize marijuana pushing closer to the mainstream a notion that was once consigned to the political fringeBallot initiatives in Oregon and Alaska would set up a network of regulated pot stores similar to those already operating in Colorado and Washington state A measure in the District of Columbia would allow possession but not retail salesIf successful the ballot initiatives could build momentum for legalization in other states and force candidates in the 2016 presidential election to take a stand on the issuePublic opinion on marijuana has shifted sharply in the past several years and polls indicate more Americans now support legalization than oppose it Advocates say that like gay marriage legal pot is an idea that gains support once people see it in actionThe more public dialogue that goes on about this issue the more support there is said Mason Tvert of the Marijuana Policy Project which is supporting the legalization drive in AlaskaOpponents say legalization will create an aggressive new industry that like the tobacco business will profit by marketing an addictive product to teens Unlike gay marriage legal pot will have harmful effects many sayI dont know anybody who looks around and says My life is better when everybody around me is stoned said Kevin Sabet a former White House drugpolicy adviser who now heads up Smart Approaches to Marijuana an antilegalization groupFew elected officials in the country support legalization  and observers do not expect that to change any time soonIt seems that this is an area where the public is out in front of their elected officials said Jake Weigler an Oregon Democratic strategist not affiliated with the legalization effortSo for the moment advocates are focused on ballot initiatives Such referendums allow voters to shape policy directly at the state level this year alone ballots in various states include measures to raise the minimum wage restrict abortion and ban certain types of bear huntingOn the marijuana issue voters in the District of Columbia back legalization by a twotoone margin according to recent polling while a narrow majority supports legal pot in Oregon Opinion polls in Alaska have been inconsistentNationwide roughly one in four Americans say they have used pot according to ReutersIpsos polling Some 47 percent support legalization and 35 percent oppose itMarijuana remains illegal under federal law but President Barack Obama has allowed Colorado and Washington to move forward with legalization Federal prosecutors have been told to focus enforcement on areas such as interstate trafficking and selling to minors rather than possession The next president will have to decide whether to continue that approach or to insist that federal law trumps local concernsCHANGES OVER TWO DECADESMarijuana has been edging toward legal status across the country since California became the first state to allow its use for medical purposes in 1996The medical use of marijuana to ease ailments ranging from glaucoma to chronic pain is now legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia Florida may become the first state in the South to approve medical pot in NovemberSome 18 states have also removed criminal penalties for possession of small amounts as policymakers on the left and the right have questioned the social and fiscal costs of imprisoning nonviolent drug users

legalization referendums in 2012Beau Kilmer a drug policy expert at the RAND Corporation a nonpartisan think tank said it is too soon to determine how those efforts are faring because there is not enough data to determine whether legalization has led to more crime higher rates of underage use or more people driving while highColorado residents are split on legalizations merits Some 51 percent of likely voters in the state support it and 41 percent oppose it according to ReutersIpsos pollingOpponents of legal marijuana are not like the antidrug warriors of past decades Many support

the actual tribal settlement Another tribe that operates a nearby casino has led the opposition to offreservation gamblingColorado Rhode Island and South Dakota will decide whether to legalize more kinds of gambling games at existing facilities For example blackjack is currently legal in Deadwood SD but craps and roulette are not Kansas South Carolina and Tennessee will vote on allowing raffles or lotteries as nonprofit fundraising vehiclesHunting Alabama and Mississippi voters will decide whether to establish a constitutional right to hunt Maine voters will decide whether to ban bearbaiting and using dogs to hunt bears And the only statewide ballot questions in Michigan are two nearly identical proposals to reject state laws authorizing wolf hunting  but it doesnt really matter how people vote on them since the states legislature enacted a new law to ensure that its authorization of a wolf hunt would stand even if voters reject the other two lawsTransportation funding Several states are considering how much money to dedicate to transportation Texas will vote on a constitutional amendment to divert certain oil and gas extraction taxes to shore up its transportation fund Maryland and Wisconsin may amend their constitutions to prevent legislators from raiding transportation funds to pay for other parts of government Massachusetts legislators have indexed the states gasoline tax to inflation so that transportation revenues would keep up with inflation voters are now being asked to repeal indexationVoting Montana will decide whether to abolish sameday voter

expansive early voting periodBaitandswitch questions Arkansass Issue 3 is titled The Arkansas Elected Officials Ethics Transparency and Financial Reform Amendment of 2014 Its most important effect however would be to lengthen term limits in the states legislature from a maximum of 8 years to 16Californias Proposition 46 is called Drug and Alcohol Testing of Doctors Medical Negligence Lawsuits Proponents advertisements have focused on the aspect of the law that would require doctors to submit to random drug and alcohol tests But the core of the dispute over Prop 46 is whether the cap on pain and suffering damages in medical negligence lawsuits should be raised to 11 million from 250000 As Adam Nagourney reported for The Times in AugustBaseactivating measures Illinois voters will consider three questions on hotbutton issues for the left raising the minimum wage requiring prescription drug plans to cover contraception and imposing a tax on millionaires to fund education However all three questions are purely advisory and will have no force of law Republicans in Illinois have criticized the questions as using the referendum process to drive turnout rather than for lawmakingOf course using referendums for base activation isnt a strategy unique to the left Republicans sought to put proposals against samesex marriage on ballots in 2004 in part to increase turnout among social conservatives And this year there are some largely symbolic questions coming from the right including those righttohunt measures in the South and a state constitutional amendment to ban the use of Sharia law in Alabama a similar proposal adopted by Oklahoma voters in 2010 was thrown out by federal courtsAre we really voting on this In general state constitutions can be amended only by popular vote and the overinclusiveness of those constitutions can lead to voters being asked to weigh in on some very mundane questionsFor example New York voters will decide whether to allow the state legislature to distribute proposed legislation to its members electronically Currently a paper copy of every proposed bill must be placed on every members desk three days before voting leading to the use of 19 million sheets of paper in every twoyear session The paperbills requirement is in the constitution so the legislature cant stop the printing without voters permissionWyoming voters will decide whether nonresidents of the state may sit on the University of Wyoming board of trustees Again yes thats a matter in the state constitution that the legislature couldnt change without voter approvalAnd then theres the issue of the Montana state auditor Despite her title the state auditors job is regulating the securities and insurance industries State Auditor Monica Lindeen thinks that confuses the public and shes already started using the title Commissioner of Securities and Insurance Making that change official requires amending the constitution which legislators voted to do last year now voter approval is requiredBut this is not the first time Montanans have weighed in on what the auditor should be called In 2006 when the legislature put a question on the ballot asking whether to rename the office as Insurance Commissioner 64 percent of voters rejected the proposal Perhaps this time will be different,2014-10-31T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/10/13/us/politics/ap-us-rethinking-pot-nations-capital.html,WASHINGTON   A debate over legalizing marijuana in the nations capital is focusing on the outsized number of arrests of African Americans on minor drug chargesPot legalization supporters in Colorado and Washington state also spoke about racial justice but their voters are mostly white and their campaigns focused more on other issues The race factor hits closer to many more homes in the District where nearly half the population is blackAnd that means this referendum could change how the nation talks about marijuana some drugpolicy experts sayI think DC is going to probably set off a chain of events in which communities of color generally and cities in particular take on the issue of legalization as a racial justice social justice issue in a much stronger way than they have so far said Bill Piper director of national affairs at the Drug Policy AllianceThere are many other differences between the District and states that have legalized pot The city is a patchwork of local and federal land and there will be no lighting up in front of the White House or at the Jefferson Memorial Also Washington remains under the thumb of Congress which could thwart the will of the voters as it has on other matters where liberal District tendencies clash with conservative priorities on Capitol HillNonetheless the District is on track to join Colorado and Washington state in legalizing marijuana A poll last month showed nearly 2 of every 3 voters favor the initiative which will be on Novembers ballot Voters in Alaska and Oregon also decide this fall whether to legalize potRoughly half of the Districts 646000 residents are black The American Civil Liberties Union found that in 2010 blacks were eight times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession in the District and 91 percent of those arrested that year were blackIt would alleviate a lot of problems said Kenneth Agee 46 a heating and air conditioning mechanic who plans to vote for legalization There may be less violence on the streets associated with marijuana trafficking and salesThe DC Council tried earlier this year to address racial disparities by decriminalizing marijuana as 17 states have done Possession of up to one ounce of pot in the District is now subject to a 25 fine among the lowest in the nation The law took effect in July despite an attempt by Rep Andy Harris a Maryland Republican to block the measureLegalization advocates say decriminalization hasnt done enough citing police statistics that show most of the 25 tickets are being handed out in predominantly black neighborhoodsWe can tell the police Guess what Its not even a crime You dont have to write a ticket said Adam Eidinger chairman of the DC Cannabis Campaign the group that crafted the initiative and got it on the ballotThe initiative also is notable for what it lacks Because ballot initiatives in the District cant affect the budget it does not provide for the legal sale of marijuana or set up a system to tax and regulate it That would be up to the mayor and the council Voters will also be choosing a new mayor in November to replace Vincent Gray and both leading candidates have said they support legalizationIn Colorado and Washington state the federal government said legal pot must be kept off federal property such as parks and other huge swaths of US land That could be more complicated in the District where the situation can change from block to block The parkland the federal government owns in the District for instance includes 59 innercity squares and trianglesBecause Congress has authority over lawmaking in the District the initiative wouldnt take effect until a congressional review period that could last several months The triedandtrue tactic for members of Congress who want to undo local laws in the District is to attach an amendment to a crucial piece of legislation such as a spending bill that funds the federal government Thats how Congress banned medical marijuana in the city for more than a decade after voters approved it Medical marijuana is now availableHarris said in a statement that he would consider using all resources available to a member of Congress to stop legalization If he attaches an amendment to a major bill its fate could depend on negotiations between the House Senate and White House The District hasnt always been the winner in such deals even during President Barack Obamas tenureSome voters remain skeptical of legalization out of concern that marijuana is harmful to young people Leaders of an antilegalization group known as Two Is Enough DC argue that District residents already suffer too much from drinking and smoking and dont need another legal drugWhere are the liquor stores in DC Theyre in the poorer communities theyre in the communities of color Theres more cigarette tobacco advertising in our community said Will Jones III the groups lead organizer Marijuana has been used to unfairly target our community Nevertheless to say that if we have it legal thats going to deal with the problem I dont understand that logic___,2014-10-13T14:20:19Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/31/opinion/what-science-says-about-marijuana.html,For Michele Leonhart the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration there is no difference between the health effects of marijuana and those of any other illegal drug All illegal drugs are bad for people she told Congress in 2012 refusing to say whether crack methamphetamines or prescription painkillers are more addictive or physically harmful than marijuanaHer testimony neatly illustrates the vast gap between antiquated federal law enforcement policies and the clear consensus of science that marijuana is far less harmful to human health than most other banned drugs and is less dangerous than the highly addictive but perfectly legal substances known as alcohol and tobacco Marijuana cannot lead to a fatal overdose There is little evidence that it causes cancer Its addictive properties while present are low and the myth that it leads users to more powerful drugs has long since been disprovedThat doesnt mean marijuana is harmless in fact the potency of current strains may shock those who havent tried it for decades particularly when ingested as food It can produce a serious dependency and constant use would interfere with job and school performance It needs to be kept out of the hands of minors But on balance its downsides are not reasons to impose criminal penalties on its possession particularly not in a society that permits nicotine use and celebrates drinkingMarijuanas negative health effects are arguments for the same strong regulation that has been effective in curbing abuse of legal substances Science and government have learned a great deal for example about how to keep alcohol out of the hands of minors Mandatory underage drinking laws and effective marketing campaigns have reduced underage alcohol use to 248 percent in 2011 compared with 334 percent in 1991 Cigarette use among high school students is at its lowest point ever largely thanks to tobacco taxes and growing municipal smoking limits There is already some early evidence that regulation would also help combat teen marijuana use which fell after Colorado began broadly regulating medical marijuana in 2010Comparing the Dangers As with other recreational substances marijuanas health effects depend on the frequency of use the potency and amount of marijuana consumed and the age of the consumer Casual use by adults poses little or no risk for healthy people Its effects are mostly euphoric and mild whereas alcohol turns some drinkers into barroom brawlers domestic abusers or maniacs behind the wheelAn independent scientific committee in Britain compared 20 drugs in 2010 for the harms they caused to individual users and to society as a whole through crime family breakdown absenteeism and other social ills Adding up all the damage the panel estimated that alcohol was the most harmful drug followed by heroin and crack cocaine Marijuana ranked eighth having slightly more than onefourth the harm of alcoholFederal scientists say that the damage caused by alcohol and tobacco is higher because they are legally available if marijuana were legally and easily obtainable they say the number of people suffering harm would rise However a 1995 study for the World Health Organization concluded that even if usage of marijuana increased to the levels of alcohol and tobacco it would be unlikely to produce public health effects approaching those of alcohol and tobacco in Western societiesMost of the risks of marijuana use are small to moderate in size the study said In aggregate they are unlikely to produce public health problems comparable in scale to those currently produced by alcohol and tobaccoWhile tobacco causes cancer and alcohol abuse can lead to cirrhosis no clear causal connection between marijuana and a deadly disease has been made Experts at the National Institute on Drug Abuse the scientific arm of the federal antidrug campaign published a review of the adverse health effects of marijuana in June that pointed to a few disease risks but was remarkably frank in acknowledging widespread uncertainties Though the authors believed that legalization would expose more people to health hazards they said the link to lung cancer is unclear and that it is lower than the risk of smoking tobaccoThe very heaviest users can experience symptoms of bronchitis such as wheezing and coughing but moderate smoking poses little risk A 2012 study found that smoking a joint a day for seven years was not associated with adverse effects on pulmonary function Experts say that marijuana increases the heart rate and the volume of blood pumped by the heart but that poses a risk mostly to older users who already have cardiac or other health problemsHow Addictive Is Marijuana Marijuana isnt addictive in the same sense as heroin from which withdrawal is an agonizing physical ordeal But it can interact with pleasure centers in the brain and can create a strong sense of psychological dependence that addiction experts say can be very difficult to break Heavy users may find they need to take larger and larger doses to get the effects they want When they try to stop some get withdrawal symptoms such as irritability sleeping difficulties and anxiety that are usually described as relatively mildThe American Society of Addiction Medicine the largest association of physicians specializing in addiction issued a white paper in 2012 opposing legalization because marijuana is not a safe and harmless substance and marijuana addiction is a significant health problemNonetheless that health problem is far less significant than for other substances legal and illegal The Institute of Medicine the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences said in a 1999 study that 32 percent of tobacco users become dependent as do 23 percent of heroin users 17 percent of cocaine users and 15 percent of alcohol drinkers But only 9 percent of marijuana users develop a dependenceAlthough few marijuana users develop dependence some do according to the study But they appear to be less likely to do so than users of other drugs including alcohol and nicotine and marijuana dependence appears to be less severe than dependence on other drugsTheres no need to ban a substance that has less than a third of the addictive potential of cigarettes but state governments can discourage heavy use through taxes and education campaigns and help provide treatment for those who wish to quitImpact on Young People One of the favorite arguments of legalization opponents is that marijuana is the pathway to more dangerous drugs But a wide variety of researchers have found no causal factor pushing users up the ladder of harm While 111 million Americans have tried marijuana only a third of that number have tried cocaine and only 4 percent heroin People who try marijuana are more likely than the general population to try other drugs but that doesnt mean marijuana prompted them to do soMarijuana does not appear to be a gateway drug to the extent that it is the cause or even that it is the most significant predictor of serious drug abuse the Institute of Medicine study said The real gateway drugs are tobacco and alcohol which young people turn to first before trying marijuanaIts clear though that marijuana is now far too easy for minors to obtain which remains a significant problem The brain undergoes active development until about age 21 and there is evidence that young people are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of marijuanaA longterm study based in New Zealand published in 2012 found that people who began smoking heavily in their teens and continued into adulthood lost an average of eight IQ points by age 38 that could not be fully restored A Canadian study published in 2002 also found an IQ loss among heavy schoolage users who smoked at least five joints a weekThe case is not completely settled The New Zealand study was challenged by a Norwegian researcher who said socioeconomic factors may have played a role in the IQ loss But the recent review by experts at the National Institute on Drug Abuse concluded that adults who smoked heavily in adolescence had impaired neural connections that interfered with the functioning of their brains Early and frequent marijuana use has also been associated with poor grades apathy and dropping out of school but it is unclear whether consumption triggered the poor gradesRestricting marijuana to adults is more important now that Colorado merchants are selling THC the drugs active ingredient in candy bars cookies and other edible forms likely to appeal to minors Experience in Colorado has shown that people can quickly ingest large amounts of THC that way which can produce frightening hallucinationsAlthough marijuana use had been declining among high school students for more than a decade in recent years it has started to climb in contrast to continuing declines in cigarette smoking and alcohol use Marijuana was found  alone or in combination with other drugs  in more than 455000 patients visiting emergency rooms in 2011 Nearly 70 percent of the teenagers in residential substanceabuse programs run by Phoenix House which operates drug and alcohol treatment centers in 10 states listed marijuana as their primary problemThose are challenges for regulators in any state that chooses to legalize marijuana But they are familiar challenges and they will become easier for governments to deal with once more of them bring legal marijuana under tight regulation,2014-07-31T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/opinion/sunday/high-time-let-states-decide-on-marijuana.html,In 1970 at the height of his whitehot war on crime President Richard Nixon demanded that Congress pass the Controlled Substances Act to crack down on drug abuse During the debate Senator Thomas Dodd of Connecticut held up a package wrapped in lightgreen paper that he said contained 3000 worth of marijuana This substance he said caused such dreadful hallucinations in an Army sergeant in Vietnam that he called down a mortar strike on his own troops A few minutes later the Senate unanimously passed the billThat law so antique that it uses the spelling marihuana is still on the books and is the principal reason that possessing the substance in Senator Dodds package is considered illegal by the United States government Changing it wouldnt even require an act of Congress  the attorney general or the secretary of Health and Human Services could each do so  although the law should be changed to make sure that future administrations could not reimpose the banRepealing it would allow the states to decide whether to permit marijuana use and under what conditions Nearly threefourths of them have already begun to do so liberalizing their laws in defiance of the federal ban Two have legalized recreational use outright and if the federal government also recognized the growing public sentiment to legalize and regulate marijuana that would almost certainly prompt more states to follow alongThe increasing absurdity of the federal governments position is evident in the text of the Nixonera law Marihuana is listed in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act alongside some of the most dangerous and mindaltering drugs on earth ranked as high as heroin LSD and bufotenine a highly toxic and hallucinogenic toad venom that can cause cardiac arrest By contrast cocaine and methamphetamine are a notch down on the governments rankings listed in Schedule IIThat illogical distinction shows why many states have begun to disregard the federal governments archaic rules Schedule II drugs while carrying a high potential for abuse have a legitimate medical use Even meth is sold in prescription form for weight loss But according to the language of the law marijuana and the other Schedule I drugs have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United StatesStates Take the Lead No medical use That would come as news to the millions of people who have found that marijuana helped them through the pain of AIDS or the nausea and vomiting of chemotherapy or the seizures of epilepsy As of this month 35 states and the District of Columbia permit some form of marijuana consumption for medical purposes New York is one of the latest states to defy the tired edict of the Controlled Substances ActIts hard for the public to take seriously a law that says marijuana and heroin have exactly the same high potential for abuse since that ignores the vastly more addictive power of narcotics which have destroyed the lives of millions of people around the world There are no documented deaths from a marijuana overdose The 44year refusal of Congress and eight administrations to alter marijuanas place on Schedule I has made the law a laughingstock one that states are openly floutingIn addition to the medical exceptions 18 states and the District of Columbia have decriminalized marijuana generally meaning that possession of small amounts is treated like a traffic ticket or ignored Two states Colorado and Washington have gone even further and legalized it for recreational purposes two others Alaska and Oregon will decide whether to do the same later this yearThe states are taking the lead because theyre weary of locking up thousands of their own citizens for possessing a substance that has less potential for abuse and destructive behavior than alcohol A decision about what kinds of substances to permit and under what conditions belongs in the purview of the states as alcohol is handledConsuming marijuana is not a fundamental right that should be imposed on the states by the federal government in the manner of abortion rights health insurance or the freedom to marry a partner of either sex Its a choice that states should be allowed to make based on their culture and their values and its not surprising that the early adopters would be socially liberal states like Colorado and Washington while others hang back to gauge the resultsPreempted by Washington Many states are unwilling to legalize marijuana as long as possessing or growing it remains a federal crime Colorado for instance allows its largest stores to cultivate up to 10200 cannabis plants at a time But the federal penalty for growing more than 1000 plants is a minimum of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to 10 million That has created a state of confusion in which lawabiding growers in Colorado can face federal penaltiesLast August the Justice Department issued a memo saying it would not interfere with the legalization plans of Colorado and Washington as long as they met several conditions keeping marijuana out of the hands of minors or criminal gangs prohibiting its transport out of the state and enforcing prohibitions against drugged driving violence and other illegal drugs The government has also said banks can do business with marijuana sellers easing a huge problem for a growing industry But the Justice Department guidance is loose aggressive federal prosecutors can ignore it if state enforcement efforts are not sufficiently robust the memo saysThats a shaky foundation on which to build confidence in a states legalization plan More important it applies only to this moment in this presidential administration President Obamas Justice Department could change its policy at any time and so of course could the next administrationHow to End the Federal Ban Allowing states to make their own decisions on marijuana  just as they did with alcohol after the end of Prohibition in 1933  requires unambiguous federal action The most comprehensive plan to do so is a bill introduced last year by Representative Jared Polis Democrat of Colorado known as the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act It would eliminate marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act require a federal permit for growing and distributing it and have it regulated just as alcohol is now by the Food and Drug Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives An alternative bill which would not be as effective was introduced by Representative Dana Rohrabacher Republican of California as the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act It would not remove marijuana from Schedule I but would eliminate enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act against anyone acting in compliance with a state marijuana lawCongress is clearly not ready to pass either bill but there are signs that sentiments are changing A promising alliance is growing on the subject between liberal Democrats and libertarian Republicans In a surprise move in May the House voted 219 to 189 to prohibit the Drug Enforcement Administration from prosecuting people who use medical marijuana if a state has made it legal It was the first time the House had voted to liberalize a marijuana law similar measures had repeatedly failed in previous years The measures fate is uncertain in the SenateWhile waiting for Congress to evolve President Obama once a regular recreational marijuana smoker could practice some evolution of his own He could order the attorney general to conduct the study necessary to support removal of marijuana from Schedule I Earlier this year he told The New Yorker that he considered marijuana less dangerous than alcohol in its impact on individuals and made it clear that he was troubled by the disproportionate number of arrests of AfricanAmericans and Latinos on charges of possession For that reason he said he supported the Colorado and Washington experimentsIts important for it to go forward he said referring to the state legalizations because its important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punishedBut a few weeks later he told CNN that the decision on whether to change Schedule I should be left to Congress another way of saying he doesnt plan to do anything to end the federal ban For too long politicians have seen the high cost  in dollars and lives locked behind bars  of their pointless war on marijuana and chosen to do nothing But many states have had enough and its time for Washington to get out of their way ,2014-07-27T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/opinion/from-marijuana-to-gun-control-liberal-initiatives-passed.html,The Democratic brand did not fare well to put it mildly in congressional and governors races on Tuesday Most were contests of political blame driven by ideological hatred for President Obama But when the ballot offered a choice on an actual policy rather than between candidates with a D or R next to their names voters made notably liberal decisions in both red and blue statesOn at least six highprofile and often contentious issues  minimum wage marijuana legalization criminal justice reform abortion rights gun control and environmental protection  voters approved ballot measures in some cases overwhelmingly that were directly at odds with the positions of many of the Republican winnersMINIMUM WAGE Initiatives to raise the minimum wage appeared on the ballots in four deepred states  Alaska Arkansas Nebraska and South Dakota  and passed in all of them The new hourly minimums range from 850 in Arkansas by 2017 to 975 in Alaska by 2016 Minimumwage increases were also approved in San Francisco to 15 an hour by 2018 and Oakland to 1225 an hour by 2015 In all an estimated 609000 lowwage workers will see raises from these approved increasesIn addition voters in Illinois and in several cities and counties in Wisconsin approved nonbinding measures calling for minimums of 10 or more If legislators follow through on the voters will 11 million workers in those states would see raisesThe latest increases bring to 29 the number of states that exceed or soon will exceed the paltry federal minimum of 725 an hour which has been in place since 2009 They underscore the broad support for higher minimums and suggest that Republicans who continue to oppose a higher federal minimum could pay a price in the 2016 elections when lowerwage workers and those who support them could turn out in higher numbersMARIJUANA  Oregon and Alaska became the third and fourth states to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes Colorado and Washington were the first two while the District of Columbia repealed all criminal and civil penalties for possession and allowed limited private cultivation of the drugEven where prolegalization measures lost advocates had reason to feel positive A proposed constitutional amendment in Florida to legalize medical marijuana received 57 percent of the vote but it still failed because amendments there require at least 60 percent approvalBefore Tuesdays election it was already clear that Americans had turned against prohibition because more than 30 states had liberalized their marijuana laws Maybe elected officials who have lagged behind the public on this issue will finally have the courage to embrace changeCRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM For the second time in three years Californians voted to shorten the sentences of people serving time in prison The state  which created the notorious threestrikes law  remains under federal court order to reduce prison overcrowdingIn 2012 voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 36 which has led to the early release of more than 1900 threestrikers serving life in prison And there has not been an increase in crime Proposition 47 on this weeks ballot converts lowlevel drug and property offenses  like shoplifting writing bad checks or simple drug possession  from felonies to misdemeanors It is expected to reduce the sentences of as many as 10000 inmatesOn Tuesday the measure which enjoyed broad bipartisan support passed with more than 58 percent of the vote Many politicians are still afraid of looking soft on crime but Californias experience shows that voters can lead the wayABORTION RIGHTS The overwhelming rejection of personhood measures in Colorado and North Dakota dealt another welldeserved blow to the effort by some opponents of reproductive rights to ban all abortions and some common forms of contraception by passing laws giving fertilized eggs legal rights and protections that apply to individualsThe defeat in Colorado was not unexpected Voters there handily quashed earlier personhood initiatives in 2008 and 2010 and they were not deceived by this rounds revised wording But few expected a similar proposal to be rejected by 64 percent of voters in North Dakota a conservative state that  like Mississippi which roundly defeated a personhood initiative three years ago  has just one abortion provider remainingUnfortunately opponents of abortion rights scored a victory in Tennessee where nearly 53 percent of voters approved a state constitutional amendment that gives the Republicanled State Legislature leeway to curtail access to safe and legal abortion care While nothing will change immediately there will likely be a rush to enact new abortion restrictions beyond those already in place in the months ahead But politicians in Tennessee would be wrong to read Tuesdays relatively close vote as a mandate to obliterate a womans fundamental rightGUN CONTROL In the aftermath of the school massacre in 2012 in Newtown Conn Congress  caving to the National Rifle Association  did nothing to protect the public from gun violence In Washington State a campaign started by outraged church and community leaders fared much better Initiative 594 which will require criminal and mentalhealth checks on gun buyers drew an impressive 60 percent voter support on TuesdayJust as important the gun lobbys measure  Initiative 591 which was on the same ballot  would have blocked background checks and was defeated by 55 percent of the vote Other campaigns are underway at the statehouse level supported by former New York City mayor Michael Bloombergs wellfinanced gunsafety movement and others Opponents decried Mr Bloombergs campaign as

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/education/edlife/just-say-no-yes-or-maybe.html,Ever since smoking pot became ubiquitous among American teenagers in the 1960s parents have struggled with how to talk to their children about it and how to protect them from its negative effectsNow in an era of broader acceptance  two states Washington and Colorado have legalized recreational use of marijuana for ages 21 and up and 23 states have approved its medical use all while marijuana remains illegal under federal law  teenagers are clearly getting conflicting widely disparate messagesThe War on Drugs and Just Say No campaigns of the 1980s provided a national moral mandate and a singular template for parents All drugs are bad But many parents today believe that the reductionist catchphrase oversimplifies the complex landscape of the nations drug useToday according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse 18 to 25yearolds are the biggest abusers of opioid pain relievers ADHD stimulants and antianxiety drugs Prescription drugs account for more overdose deaths among this age group than all illegal drugs combined Alcohol remains the No 1 health hazard and daterape drug on college campuses And a new generation of pensize odorless vaporizers with USB ports for easy recharging allows students to get high virtually anywhere even at schoolWith these realities in mind more parents seem to be accepting the probability that their teenagers will selfmedicate at some point and they see pot as having more manageable risks than other substances Rather than adhere to a just say no theology they are embracing a nuanced harmreduction approach They are even in some cases revealing their own use to help create a dialogue with their childrenHonesty about drug use is encouraged by Dr Donald A Misch medical director at the University of Colorado Boulder who oversees the health of nearly 30000 students on a campus long considered marijuanafriendly During an orientation session in August for parents entitled Stress Risk Taking AlcoholDrugs and Parents as Partners What Every CU Parent Should Know Dr Misch responded to a fathers question about whether to tell his son about his own prior usage What you should say depends on your family he advised As a general rule I believe in being honestDr Misch who delivered the lecture 13 times to reach as many parents as possible assured them that smoking a joint every once in a while posed minimal health risk but he also warned with a series of statistics projected on overhead screens that marijuana can cause eating and sleeping problems productivity problems various cognitive difficulties as well as motor vehicle accidents psychosis and addictionWhen you are high or acutely intoxicated with marijuana you dont make good memories he said adding with some levity Every time your kid goes to class high you arent getting your moneys worthTo help parents guide their children away from risky behaviors Dr Misch urged parents to stay in touch with their children especially just before the weekend and encouraged them to use the universitys online handbook that guides them through what to say how not to react and how best to leverage parental power which remains strong even after children have settled in on campusEven though your son or daughter might not acknowledge it you still matter he said If a student gets in trouble for using marijuana on campus we can put them on probation we can throw them out of housing but what college students consistently report is that the worst thing we can do to them the absolute death penalty is call youTodays parenting approaches to marijuana use range from zero tolerance to reluctant acceptance to outright permission Here a look at these perspectivesSHARING A JOINTToni and Barry Fox of Salida Colo never hid the fact that they smoked marijuana from Cheyenne Mr Foxs daughter from a previous marriage But during her teenage years they made it clear she wasnt allowed to use any intoxicants Were adults our brains are developed Ms Fox 42 recalled explaining to her She was a teenager so we had zero tolerance for any substance that would alter her brain developmentWhen Cheyenne got caught smoking a cigarette at school at 16 and had to call home to tell her parents her father reacted swiftly and firmly I lost my car for six months said Cheyenne now 22 and a recent graduate of Metropolitan State University of Denver That was the most depressing day of my whole lifeMr Fox told Cheyenne that if she was interested in trying marijuana once she turned 18 he would assist her at home under his supervision She was So on the afternoon of her birthday he honored his promise The first time I ever smoked she said my dad rolled a joint and handed it to me and told me Go in the backyard and dont go anywhere Ill make you nachos in an hour  The next day her parents helped her secure a card to access medical marijuanaMs Foxs biggest fear for Cheyenne was something happening to her alcoholbased like being a victim of an assault at a partyI grew up in Minnesota where alcohol was readily available to teenagers she said I didnt know a female growing up who didnt have some sexual incident related to intoxication As a youth Ms Fox dealt with the pain of her fathers suicide with alcohol and harder drugs before discovering marijuana She believes so strongly in marijuanas palliative power that in 2010 she opened a medical marijuana dispensary in Denver which she converted to a recreational dispensary this year Cheyenne who earned a degree in marketing works at a new second locationNow when we smoke marijuana together says the mom we talk businessSMOKE BUT SAFELYMark Klein 52 a software entrepreneur from Los Altos Calif acknowledged to his children that he smokes pot when they reached high school When my oldest son asked I wanted to be honest said Mr Klein who has two sons  a college sophomore and a recent graduate  and twin 18yearold daughters both freshmenAfter trying pot in high school Mr Klein sampled it again while in his early 30s and started using it about once a month Rather than insist that his children avoid marijuana altogether he talked to them about using it safely urging them to call him for a ride home rather than drive while high or accept a ride from a stoned friend and not to indulge in edibles Its way too easy to keep eating a fivedose cookie when the effects dont show up for 45 minutes he said He also drew distinctions between his occasional use and people who smoke pot every day and lose track of their goalsI told them Dont let marijuana be a big part of your life Keep your eyes on your objectives  Mr Klein says he knows that some of his children have tried marijuana and despite his own use he isnt thrilled about it My desire is that they dont use drugs dont use alcohol and dont have sex but they are teenagers and human beings and so thats probably not going to happenTOKE TALKSAfter being caught smoking a bong in the family sunroom as teenagers Arian Creque and her stepbrother Michael cowered while their mother who opposes anyone in her family using recreational marijuana yelled at them But a couple of nights later when Michael went back to the room to smoke a joint after work his father surprised him by sauntering up and producing a small metal pipeI was just floored said Mr Creque now 22 We sat out there for an hour and a half and we had a blast We talked about everything from when I started and how much I did to what was going on in schoolAs for his father he didnt love that his teenagers were smoking pot In a recent conversation in their home in Littleton Colo after a 36hour shift at his longtime tech job he recalled telling them about his own use a single toke several times a week to relax after work or help him fall asleep and sharing stories of his experiences to help them understand moderation He also encouraged them to avoid parties where a large number of people get intoxicated I used to tell the kids that if you get over eight or nine people somebodys going to get drunk somebodys going to punch somebody somebody is going to throw up in the yard he said When it comes to kicking back with friends you want to keep it smallAdded his son He was trying to teach me some good life lessons and keep me safe The younger Mr Creque who earned an associate degree in 2012 in business and works at a car dealership said he smokes several times a day and dabs using a heated nail to extract an intense fume from the resin I use marijuana a little too much he acknowledgedHis stepsister now 21 is working toward a bachelors online at the University of Colorado Denver For her getting high is an antidote to what she describes as nearconstant anxiety My whole thing is my future  whats coming next I finished my homework but whats coming next She sleeps between shifts at the hotel where she works 50 hours a week and otherwise lives in her parents basement When I smoke she said Im more in the presentPOLICING THE PADLast year Lisa Fields a 53yearold single working mother from Los Angeles County discovered that her teenage son had been smoking pot Fearing it could lead him down a harmful path she took a scorchedearth approach to making sure he wouldnt do it againAfter he went to sleep Ms Fields looked through his backpack and found two enormous joints professional looking and rolled with a filter You could definitely tell they were from a dispensary she said She stayed up all night reading on the Partnership for DrugFree Kids website about how to stay calm what to say to her son and what other steps she could take to keep him cleanIn the morning she confronted him and warned he could not carry an illegal substance to school or keep it in her house putting her at risk After school she took him to a park  a place where he had room to breathe and express himself  and began asking questions Next she tore apart the house finding not only more marijuana and a glass pipe but also hashish He told me he knew kids who actually smoked it in school using vapor pens that resemble ink pens Ms Fields saidTo make concealing things impossible she removed his bedroom door and took all the drawers out of his dresser stacking his clothes in open binsHe had to start from ground zero with trust she said She ordered him to research and write a paper on how marijuana affects adolescent brain development she took him for urine and blood tests  I also wanted to scare him she admitted  and then to his favorite burrito joint where he revealed how hard it had been to make friends in a new schoolSmoking dope had allowed him to fit in I could have weed at my house he said and people want to come over  something Ms Fields confirmed when she found over 1200 in credit card charges for takeout foodMs Fields who acknowledges having used marijuana on occasion as an adult says she had previously supported its legalization but after seeing how easily her son a minor could gain access to drugs sold legally to someone else she has reconsideredWhen people voted to legalize marijuana they didnt consider how it changes how children feel about drugs she said They think its all OK and its natural It gives them a different perspective on the drugZERO TOLERANCEA week before starting college at Loyola UniversityMaryland in September Debbie McBrides 18yearold son Connor had a request Mom he asked can I have a couple of friends over You dont have to get the beer Well get itMs McBride could hardly believe her son would even ask such a question given her zero tolerance for drugs and alcohol What was he thinking He said Im going to college in a week Ms McBride 51 who works for a portfolio manager and teaches youth at a Morristown NJ church began talking to her two sons about the dangers of drugs when they were in middle school On the refrigerator she hung an article about research on marijuanas effects I have this part highlighted she said reading aloud  The brain undergoes active development until about age 21 She says that the national debate over legalization  polls show slightly more than half of Americans favoring it  and the tacit acceptance of teenage drinking in their suburban community have made it more difficult for her children to accept her message about illicit use of substancesShe and Connor arrived at many graduation parties to find kegs in the backyard If drinking is tolerated he wanted to know why not pot And my answer to that is alcohol itself is not illegal Its the age that is illegal Marijuana is

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/business/international/tasmania-big-supplier-to-drug-companies-faces-changes.html,Now is the sowing season for opium poppies in the Australian state of Tasmania Tractors chug up and down paddocks pulling elaborate machinery that drills pairs of adjacent miniature holes in the dirt and then drops a dozen tiny kernels of fertilizer in one of the holes and a tiny poppy seed in the otherBy November the fields will be carpeted in pink flowers with an occasional splash of white or mauve Then the flowers will drop away leaving behind distinctive cupshaped pods packed with tiny poppy seeds along with the opium latex that surrounds them When the latex dries two months later the pods are harvested and hauled to factories where machinery separates the seeds and grinds up the rest to extract the valuable narcotic alkaloidsTasmania an island off Australias southern coast is the start of a global supply chain that encompasses the biggest drug companies and produces 12 billion a year of opiate painkillersNearly a halfcentury of assiduous plant breeding a gentle climate and tight regulations have given Tasmania a hammerlock on production of one of the pharmaceutical industrys most important raw materials Tasmania which is about the size of West Virginia grows about 85 percent of the worlds thebaine an opium poppy extract used to make OxyContin and a family of similarly powerful prescription drugs that have transformed pain management over the last two decades It produces all of the worlds oripavine another extract which is used to treat heroin overdoses and shows promise in controlling other addictions Tasmania also accounts for a quarter of the worlds morphine and codeine two older painkillers from opium poppies that are still widely used particularly outside North AmericaBut the global pharmaceutical industry is increasingly worried that it is hooked on the islands opium poppy suppliesThe two manufacturers that dominate Tasmanian opium extract production have begun twin battles to diversify supply sources and alter the plants genome to produce a stronger more productive crop The manufacturers GlaxoSmithKline and Johnson  Johnson provide narcotic alkaloids to their own painkiller units and to other companies worldwide which have started demanding that the two giants act to ensure reliable suppliesThey look at the map of the world see Tasmania at the bottom and say Are we taking a hemispheric risk and putting all our eggs in one basket said Steve Morris the general manager of opiates for GlaxoSmithKlineThe drug companies are pushing for regulatory approval to cultivate opium poppies for export on the Australian mainland near Melbourne The two companies are also trying to persuade the Tasmanian government to legalize genetic engineering for poppies to develop varieties that produce more concentrated narcotics and are less vulnerable to storms or diseasesTasmanian farmers have had a mixed response They strongly oppose production on the Australian mainland and want to hold on to the poppy business which accounts for nearly onetenth of the farm revenue in Tasmania or roughly 80 million a year But they know they cant keep the industry if they cant ensure supply and they are enthusiastic supporters of genetic engineering Environmentalists and so far the Tasmanian government favor keeping the Australian state clean of genetically manipulated organisms a goal that growers dismiss We grow narcotic drugs  by definition theyre not clean said Glynn Williams the president of Poppy Growers Tasmania a trade groupCockatoos and PoppiesRohan Kile the poppy crop supply manager for Glaxo knows Tasmania well As a child there he moved from town to town every three years because his father was a state forests manager Now Mr Kile a lanky outdoorsman travels from farm to farm to assess opium productionOn a recent crystalline morning overlooking a valley with a wide meandering stream he gave advice on loading the fertilizer and seeds behind the tractor for planting Later in the season he will discuss harvesting The pods need to be dry enough for processing but if left too long they may be eaten by hungry sulphurcrested cockatoos and other birds that roost in eucalyptus trees or the goldenflowering gorse bushes that hug the low hillsMr Kile recommends strong fences to prevent wallabies  close relatives of kangaroos  and people from hopping or walking into fields eating the poppies and suffering narcotic effects Stoned wallabies can become disoriented and lose their ability to find water he said Humans who ingest Tasmanian poppies can dieAfter harvest in February farmers deliver the cups to two main factories Johnson  Johnsons greenwalled complex in Westbury and Glaxos smaller operation in Latrobe a Tasmanian river town that calls itself the platypus capital of the world The bulk of the opium poppy extract produced in Tasmania is shipped to pharmaceutical factories in the Northeastern United States With its wealth and a largely private health care system willing to pay up for drugs the United States accounts for threequarters of global opiate painkiller sales by tonnage and fivesixths by valueThe entire process is tightly monitored by a United Nationsauthorized board which tracks production and requires strict security This body the International Narcotics Control Board discourages holding big stockpiles for fear that they might be diverted into the production of heroin whose market is more than four times the size of the opiate painkillers marketBut without excess stockpiles the industry can get caught flatfooted in a bad year Mr Kile recalls the torrential downpours in northern Tasmania three years ago that devastated the morphine poppy crop just as it was flowering Although Glaxo said it met all existing orders pharmaceutical companies and health agencies around the world suddenly found themselves watching their stocks and hoping that they would last until the next harvestThe industry is quietly increasing its reserves of raw thebaine It had only an eightmonth supply on hand at the start of last year  not enough to cover the total loss of one harvest  but it now appears to have the recommended oneyear supply according to the narcotics boardThe likelihood of complete failure of the Tasmanian crop is extremely remote said Rachel David a spokeswoman for Johnson  Johnson But more and more our customers are asking for a plan in case of a dramatic catastrophe in TasmaniaThe Road to TasmaniaThe modern poppy industry can be traced to the early 1950s when Stephen King an agricultural scientist for what was then the Glaxo Group tried in Britain to find a better way to harvest the seed pods During World War II morphine was widely used to care for wounded soldiers and civilians but was sometimes in short supplyBuilding on the findings of a Hungarian scientist in the 1920s Mr King looked to commercialize a laborefficient process to extract opium from poppies  by using machinery to grind up dried pods instead of making tiny incisions by hand to drain pods that were still green In the initial phase he discovered that poppies grown in Britain had too little opium because of frequent rain and he began searching for a better climate in a secure location He wanted to start production on the southern coast of Australia near MelbourneBut his work coincided with the rise of heroin As heroin poured into Europe and the United States world leaders struggled to respond International pacts in 1961 and 1972 called for limiting production to heavily regulated areas notably Australia France Hungary India Spain and TurkeyThe United States also decided to buy 80 percent of its morphine from Turkey and India a rule that remains in place today Turkey was given particular preference as a bulwark to halt the spread of communism and as a heavily Muslim country that had warm relations with IsraelWith concerns increasing over heroin Australian officials rebuffed Mr Kings plan to grow poppies on the mainland Instead they sent him to start poppy farms on an island that the rest of the world barely remembered TasmaniaThe isolation proved an advantageTowns like Launceston Longford Evandale and other currentday hubs of poppy production in north and central Tasmania had been settled by tens of thousands of British and Irish convicts transported here in the early 19th century as a cheap alternative to prisons in the British Isles They were followed by thousands of socalled free settlers who built communities with main streets still lined by two and threestory pink sandstone buildingsThen people largely stopped moving there With 500000 people Tasmania now rivals Iceland in having one of the worlds least mobile populations with little immigration or emigration Particularly in rural Tasmania people do not just know everyone in their towns  their families tend to have known one another for at least four generations and often five or six Secrets are few helping to keep drug use in checkWhile marijuana and methamphetamines have sometimes been a problem in Tasmania heroin production has been virtually nonexistent despite all the raw opium grown and collected each year Arriving aircraft and ships are closely watchedYou wont see many tiedyed shirts in Longford said Mr Kile the Glaxo manager as he drove past Longfords brick Anglican church which dates to 1839More Than MorphineMoving to Tasmania in 1965 Mr King set up a laboratory and a plantbreeding program that would transform poppy production turning each flower into a tiny factory churning out a range of highly specialized narcotic alkaloids suited to pharmaceutical manufacturing His team soon followed to Tasmania by Johnson  Johnson scientists began breeding different strains tailored to each of the islands seven microclimates and figuring out the right combination of fertilizers for each varietyAs the breeding program developed drug researchers in Europe and the United States figured out that morphine was not the only alkaloid narcotic of value in opium poppies They experimented with thebaine oripavine and other chemicals in opium finding important usesIn 1998 scientists at Johnson  Johnson commercialized Norman a variety that produced a much higher concentration of thebaine They followed in 2009 with Ted a variety that made mostly thebaine Glaxo developed its own varietiesTasmanias dominance of poppy production emerged with the rapid rise of OxyContin and other thebainebased drugs in the 1990s Thebaine unlike morphine was not included in the American governments policy of buying 80 percent of opiate raw material from Turkey and India That allowed Glaxo and Johnson  Johnson as well as the drug companies that bought from them to turn almost entirely to Tasmania for the raw materials needed for newer painkillers and addiction treatmentsFew medicines in the past quartercentury have made as big a difference in treatment as thebainebased painkillers  and few have been as quickly profitable for the pharmaceutical industry OxyContin which is made by Purdue Pharma and produces 2 billion a year in retail sales is derived mainly from Tasmaniagrown thebaine Rival makers have introduced more than 40 other chemically similar opiate painkillers like Roxicodone and PercocetThe worldwide sales boom for OxyContin and its siblings has resulted in a tripling of Tasmanias poppy acreage since the late 1990s to nearly 30000 hectares or 74000 acres Poppies tailored for thebaine production now are about twothirds of Tasmanias crop with morphine poppies making up an additional quarter and codeine and a few other alkaloids the restThe Mainland ThreatCharlie Mackinnon a squareshouldered fifthgeneration farmer takes pride in his familys attachment to the land He is even a little embarrassed when he says his ancestors didnt build his 1832 homestead themselves  his greatgreatgrandfather bought it from another farmerStanding beside his field Mr Mackinnon 35 ticked off the concerns for poppy farmers Downy mildew a plant pest is a constant fear The big worry is rainHe recounted how a friend planted almost 300 acres of opium poppies last year only to lose the entire crop when a heavy rain left his fields so soggy that the plants roots died They dont like wet feet he said They dont like too much moistureTasmanias climate has become a little less gentle lately for reasons not well understood An increasingly severe drought from 2006 to 2010 ended in northern Tasmania only with rains and flooding that devastated the 2011 crop though central Tasmania had a bumper crop that yearTasmanian farmers can sell their poppy harvests for at least 1600 an acre significantly more than other crops But Mr Mackinnon and other farmers said herbicide and fungicide costs were high Poppies also deplete beneficial bacteria and fungi in the soil So they can be grown only once every third year in fertile northern Tasmania alternating with potatoes and as little as once every seventh year in drier areas farther south where they alternate with sheep pasturesPoppies have become Tasmanias thirdlargest farm sector by revenue after dairy and beef If its done correctly it can give a good return said Mr Williams the president of Poppy Growers Tasmania who is a longtime farmerTasmanian farmers are fighting to preserve their role France and Spain are looking at ways to expand the tiny heavily regulated production of stateaffiliated companies that run their modest opium poppy fields Britain and Portugal have unilaterally approved legalizing regulated opium production but they dont have the backing of the United Nationsauthorized boardThe bigger threat for Tasmanian farmers is closer to home Hidden deep inside a few farms on the Australian mainland and not visible from any road are the secret opium gardens of Johnson  Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline The locations are known only to the farmers a few state and federal Australian regulators and some managers from the two pharmaceutical giants Neither company will provide any details except that the fields are near Melbourne in the Australian state of VictoriaAfter months of debate the state Parliament in Victoria voted in March to authorize commercial growing of opium poppies Tasmanian farmers and politicians are now lobbying the national government not to issue export permits for opiate material grown in VictoriaThe drug companies contend that export permits are a national prerogative not linked to the states where crops are grown The national health ministry declined to comment except to say Export approval is granted by the federal government subject to legislation and international obligationsOne possible solution under discussion has been to limit poppies on the mainland to thebaine varieties because it is nearly impossible to convert them into heroin But the drug companies have been wary of any limits And requiring thebaine varieties on the mainland could intensify another problem illegal poppy teaAt least three people have died in the last four years in Tasmania after stealing poppy seed pods and trying to make them into tea More deaths could occur if poppies are grown on the mainland where the drug culture is stronger and not everyone understands the dangers Raw thebaine can cause convulsions when consumedTasmanian officials have been replacing warning signs at poppy fields The old ones said illegal use may cause death The new warning says Has caused deathsYou Can Pop a Gene InWhile walking along the edge of Mr Mackinnons field Mr Kile noticed a plant a few inches high growing in an adjacent area of untilled dirt He bent down and ripped it out tap root and all Poppies that grow from stray seeds on unlicensed land he said have to be sprayed or plowed under a task overseen by a special Tasmanian state agency He also keeps a wary eye out for pests like downy mildewThe drug companies say they have the answer to plant pests the tools of genetic engineering If a disease comes along you can pop a gene in Mr Kile saidAgronomists have already mapped much of the opium poppys genome But Tasmania has had two consecutive fiveyear bans on genetic engineering in agriculture The second will expire in November and Jeremy Rockliff Tasmanias minister for primary industries said the state government plans to introduce legislation to extend a broad ban for another five years Poppy farmers and the pharmaceutical companies want an exemptionSurprisingly little consensus exists on what kind of genetic engineering would be done if authorized During a recent dinner interview in Canberra after a day of lobbying national officials Keith Rice the chief executive of Poppy Growers Tasmania and Mr Williams the same groups president sharply disagreed with each other on whether the industry should genetically modify poppies to add resistance to Roundup a Monsanto product that is one of the worlds most widely used herbicidesMr Williams said that introducing Roundup resistance was a bad idea because it would make it harder to spray and kill poppies like the one Mr Kile had found If herbicide resistance spread drugcontrol officials elsewhere might struggle to kill illegal opium plantsBut Mr Rice strongly disagreed saying Tasmanian farmers should be able to spray their fields with Roundup to kill all the weeds leaving only the resistant poppy plants alive That would sharply reduce costs and help eliminate the need for growing poppies in other less secure locationsEither way farmers here say that if Tasmania does not allow genetic engineering it will probably happen elsewhere including around Melbourne where there is no comparable ban Their worry is that this scenic island of historic towns and bucolic hills may become little more than another quaint farming area if it does not actIf Tasmania continues with a ban on it said Michael Badcock another longtime farmer Tasmania may get left behind,2014-07-20T00:00:00Z,drugs

that dot the valley the heart Moroccos potgrowing region Benabdallah says he openly grows the crop while understanding the risk We are regularly subject to blackmail by the gendarmes he said as he scythed through stalks and wrapped them into a bundleMoroccos marijuana farmers live in a strange limbo in which the brilliant green fields are left alone while the growers themselves face constant police harassment A new draft law may bring some reprieve It aims to legalize marijuana growing for medical and industrial uses a radical idea for a Muslim nation It could alleviate poverty and social unrest but the proposal faces stiff opposition in this conservative country as well as the suspicions of farmers themselves who think politicians can do nothing help themMorocco is joining many other countries in the world as well as some US states in reexamining drug policies and looking to some degree of legalization Moroccos situation is unusual however in that Islamic traditions create deep taboos against drugs despite the centuriesold tradition of growing marijuana in the northThere are some 80000 families in the northern Rif mountains of Morocco who make their living from growing pot according to UN estimates the region supplies nearly all of Europes hashish and is the worlds top supplier along with Afghanistan The World Customs Authority reported that in 2013 65 percent of hashish seized at customs worldwide came from Morocco Estimates vary wildly for how much the business is worth but legalization would certainly provide a substantial boost to farmers and to Moroccos anemic economy which is forecast to grow by just 25 percent this yearFor now the profits go to the buyers and smugglers who pay the farmers little for their crop and reap huge profits in Europe  where consumption in places like Amsterdams famed coffee shops has been decriminalized The trade has brought little wealth to the region with farmers saying a kilogram of kif as the plant is known locally sells for 8 and they make an average of just 3000 to 4000 a yearThey say they are completely neglected by the state  except for its police forceGrowers say that neighbors with scores to settle file anonymous complaints with authorities resulting in a visit from the paramilitary gendarmes confiscation of the crop and months or years in prison  unless a bribe can be paid Nourredine Mediane a lawmaker from the region said some 15000 people from the area are currently in detention and another 30000 are wanted by authoritiesClutching his widebrimmed straw hat one deeply lined farmer described how he learned he was wanted by police when he went to renew his national ID card in a nearby town Since then he has not left his mountainside village and relies on family members to pick up suppliesI am scared to even go to the doctor he said asking that his name not be used for fear of arrest I dont even have the national identity card and Im stuck in the villageDespite fear of arrest many locals have no choice but to grow pot The valleys rocky soil is poor and the only crop that seems to thrive is marijuana which was legal to grow under royal mandate in certain regions of the Rif until 1974 when the government passed a blanket ban on the cultivation and consumption of all drugsThe marijuana ban was passed just as European visitors to the marijuana growing regions taught the farmers to produce hashish for export to feed rising demand across the Mediterranean The ban also brought Morocco in line with the 1961 UN convention against drugs it had signedThe securitycentered approach to the problem has failed argued Mehdi Bensaid a lawmaker with the opposition Party of Authenticity and Modernity that was founded by a close associate of the king The partys draft law would keep pot consumption  widespread among young Moroccans in parts of the country  illegal but legalize productionUnder the legislation the entire crop would go to a state agency that would use it to produce new cannabisbased medications that have been developed to aid cancer and multiple sclerosis patients and eventually for industrial uses such as textiles paper and fiberboard as well Under the UN drug conventions marijuana can be legally be grown for industrial and medical uses Factories would be set up in the region to process the plant and provide jobs The statedriven industry would prevent cannabis from being turned into hash and going to the smugglersBensaid added that he has already been contacted by European and American pharmaceutical companies interested in investing in the venture if the law passes It is not clear however if there is sufficient demand for medical purposes to meet the vast supply coming from Moroccos fields And UN conventions would prevent the statesanctioned crop to be sold abroad for recreational purposesStill Bensaid sees legalization as a potential economic saviorIf Morocco has a crop that could produce these medicines that could be sold today in the US Canada and France it is an employment opportunity for citizens living in a miserable situation Bensaid told The Associated Press Its a winwin for the state because there is tax for the citizens because they are in an illegal situation and for the sick who get their medicineBensaids party is backed in its effort by Moroccos oldest political party the Istiqlal or Independence Party The two have presented a draft law to both the upper and lower houses of parliament It is unclear however if the draft is on the schedule to be debated when parliament reopens this monthThe laws have received some highprofile backing including the ministers of health and higher education who have supported the idea of using marijuana for scientific researchHowever the Islamistled government and the powerful palace have remained silent with few wanting to break a deeprooted taboo against illegal drugs While not specifically banned in Islam marijuanas effects are likened by most imams to alcohol which is banned by the religionMustapha Khalfi Moroccos government spokesman and communications minister refused to discuss the draft law pointing only to government efforts to combat drug smuggling and reduce the amount of land under cultivationMembers of the Islamist Party for Justice and Development have accused those behind the law of merely looking to boost their standing in the Rif Valley region ahead of key local elections next yearThese people are not just trying to get votes from the poor peasants in these regions but are also looking for the sympathy and money from the drug barons ahead of the 2015 elections said Abdelaziz Aftati a leading member of the Islamist partyThe growers themselves express suspicion about the plans concocted by politicians in Rabat Farmers worry that legalization would mean a fall in the already low price for their crop and competition from wealthy estates with vast acreage and the latest agricultural technologyIf legalization happened for all of Morocco we could never compete with the other farmers that have lots of land and the price of cannabis wouldnt be any different than that of carrots  wed make nothing said local activist Mohammed BenabdallahMore than any other region in Morocco the wild Rif mountains have seen little government investment in no small part due to a history of rebellions and the marijuana cultivation itselfThe locals are mostly Berbers North Africas original inhabitants rather than Arabs In the 1920s the region threw off Spanish rule and declared an independent republic that was subdued only after years of attacks by French and Spanish soldiersThe Rif revolted again in 1958 soon after Moroccos independence In the aftermath it was left poor and undeveloped with bad roads and few schools and hospitals Locals say the police dont dare to destroy all the marijuana fields for fear of provoking another uprisingSo instead the economy remains firmly anchored to marijuana Every year with the approach of the cold autumn months villagers take their dried bundles of kif place them over fine mesh and rhythmically beat them with sticks to extract a powder which is then rolled into bricks of hash Pot is still smoked by the older generation in longstemmed pipes called sebsisBy November the sheer walls of this valley will resound with the sound of tapping It is a like music said Benabdallah a festival of hashishThe government has repeatedly tried to persuade farmers to grow other crops but efforts have failed By 2010 most alternative crop programs had been suspendedWalking along terraces of rocky earth 63yearold Mohammed Fathi said he tried to grow other crops not least to fend off 32 police complaints against him He was part of a cooperative that grew olives figs and almonds but it

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/education/edlife/legally-high-marijuana-on-campus-colorado.html,In an apartment complex just outside the western edge of the University of Colorados flagship campus a 22yearold psychology major named Zach has just leaned over an expensive oil rig  a twisting glass tube that he will use to smoke shatter a hash oil concentrate Once he lights up his high will be rapid and intenseZach spends hundreds of dollars on smoking devices But he has a side income This evenings session was preceded by visits to three medical marijuana dispensaries where using his stateissued card he bought pot products to sell to friends at a markup Runners  campus argot as in running around buying for others  are an open secret on campusZach takes a seat on his overstuffed sectional and tells how it happened His first day living on campus a sophomore had taken him to a dispensary for a pizza with marijuana baked in He asked how he could get his own card and friends coached him on telling a doctor about anxiety nausea or back pain I just said I had a bike accident when I was younger and that caused lower back pain which caused nausea and that caused anxiety he recalls I was afraid it wouldnt happen so I just got all three knocked out He presented a bill mailed to his dorm as proof he was a state resident which he wasnt and received a card allowing him to access medical marijuana immediately two ounces at a timeSome of Zachs clients are under 21 and cannot buy recreational cannabis legally But others are older students who simply dont want to pay the hefty tax  three times that levied on medical marijuana So despite the abundance of recreational cannabis products since the first retail shops opened in January there is still a vibrant black market for medical marijuana which has been legal in Colorado since 2001 with a doctors recommendationTheres definitely still the demand says Zach who is on track to graduate in December He makes anywhere from a few dollars to a thousand a month depending on how much he hustles but he says that overall sales have declined a bit what with retail shops student growers and all the medical cardsIts difficult to say if students are smoking more There is no longterm data by age but statewide about 16000 18 to 24yearolds are on the medical marijuana registry Thats 14 percent of all cardholders City of Boulder tax revenue for medical marijuana for the first six months of 2014 was up 30 percent at 500000  about equal to revenue on recreational marijuanaNationally marijuana use among young adults has clearly been trending upward The percentage of college students who reported smoking within the previous year plummeted from a high of 51 percent in 1981 to a low of 265 percent in 1991 and has been zigzagging back up to some 36 percent in 2013 according to the Monitoring the Future Study at the University of Michigan Data released in September show that one of 20 college students one of 11 men gets high daily or near daily the highest rate since 1981 To put that in perspective from 1990 to 1994 fewer than one in 50 students used pot that frequentlyExperts say that the increase is surely a reflection of relaxed laws governing marijuana in some states a movement gaining momentum Floridians will face a ballot initiative on Tuesday on whether to legalize medical marijuana which is allowed in almost half the states Alaska Oregon and District of Columbia voters will decide whether to follow Colorado and Washington State where recreational marijuana has been legal since 2012The amendments ban smoking in public  on streets and in parks shops and restaurants The same holds for campuses including university housingDr Donald A Misch associate vice chancellor for health and wellness at the University of Colorado says that his main concern about the way legalization will affect students is that the industry  and associated advertising and commercialization  promotes the notion that cannabis is harmless Monitoring the Future asks high school seniors if they see great harm in smoking regularly 60 percent do not In 2005 42 percent did notDr Misch is working with other campus officials to increase awareness about the effects of the substance including its impact on learning It is not going to turn you into an ax murderer he says but what I tell people is The good news is that marijuana is in many ways better than alcohol The bad news is its not as benign as many people want you to believe Tucked away in a windowless basement room in the universitys Wardenburg Health Center three cleancut undergraduates are examining how marijuana is affecting them Breathe  a sign suggests in the softly lit room Backpacks slung to the floor the students form a restless crescent  pencils tapping legs jiggling  around a newage rug of concentric circlesDid anybody get in more trouble over the weekend asks Stephen Bentley a substance abuse counselor They hadnt The session designed to help them see the discrepancy between getting high and reaching their goals is one of three they have been mandated to attend All are under 21 and were caught smokingMarijuana citations by the campus police are in fact down  154 as of Oct 3 compared with almost 256 in the same period last year Christina Gonzales dean of students says the university is moving from a punitive stance to a more educational approach easing up on enforcement But last year 718 students who had been sent to the health center by the courts or university after a substancerelated offense mostly alcohol were found to be engaged in pot use that put them at riskMichael a sophomore from Colorado was caught over the summer in a Boulder park for possession A bike cop came up and saw me exhale He paid fines and fees of about 150 performed 24 hours of community service and had to complete Mr Bentleys threepart class If he stays out of trouble for several months the court will wipe his record clean During the summer he was smoking about five times a week but has slowed down with the start of classesMr Bentley asks the group about problems with memory which seems to resonate with Michael If I get high a number of times per week he says I notice that my memory slumps a littleMr Bentley empathizes You cant remember your car keys phoneNo its not like that If a friend tells me an answer to a problem when Im working on homework and Im not quite there yet I cant remember itSo you cant hold it in your mind Mr Bentley affirms No judgment no confrontation no labels This is the mantraMr Bentley and counselors at other universities say they are seeing a small but growing number of students who have been smoking since age 14 and are serious users He mentions dabs an exponentially powerful form of marijuana Last year he got an email from a member of the housing staff Students were wielding a butane torch in the dorm The kids were saying Were making crme brle on the hot plate Not exactly The torches heat a nail A dab of pot concentrate is placed on the head Vapors are inhaledThats the way things work in this culture says Mr Bentley who has more than 20 years in the addiction field 10 at Boulder People on the front lines are playing catchup a lot of times Word spread quickly through the staff of the potential fire hazardUniversities are searching for ways to respond to marijuana the most abused substance on campuses after alcohol But interventions are often adaptations of programs for heavy drinkers that dont capture the marijuana experience says Jason R Kilmer an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Washington In a typical program for experienced smokers students answer questions adapted from a widely used index of alcoholrelated problems Has the student ever passed out after using Got into a fight But they arent asked about eating too much coughing and problems with sleep motivation memory and attention  top unwanted effects of marijuana named in a recent survey of students by Dr Kilmer and colleagues Helping students recognize problems can prompt them to reduce consumptionSome colleges including the University of North Carolina at Wilmington Boston College and the University of Southern Indiana have been adding programs tailored to marijuana users CUBoulder offers a tier of psychoeducational options  two levels of individual sessions for mild and more serious users and a group program for moderate and heavier users For students unable to curb their use a more extensive program is being planned to help them add structure to their lives and find relaxation alternatives  yoga maybeIts a retention strategy as well Mr Bentley says Users even infrequent are more likely to drop out according to a 2013 report from the University of MarylandAlan J Budney a researcher and professor at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth ticks off academic fallout Not getting to class changing majors the B average becomes a C average  they are small things that arent disastrous but they can change the course of where you are headingResearch on universities efforts is scant Several studies have shown encouraging if shortterm results Three months after a brief intervention students from two campuses in the Northwest reported smoking less and experiencing fewer potrelated consequences ditto for Wilmington students one month after their programAt the heart of the sessions is motivational interviewing which gets students to voice their own ambivalence about their use and eventually consider changing itStudents first discuss whats good about getting high how it lubricates social interactions and dissipates boredom and stress Michael a driven computer engineering major tells Mr Bentleys group that pot helps him feel his emotions Marijuana changed my point of view on life not to take things so hard and go easier on myself And of course there are the perceptionaltering qualities Ben a junior smiles and says When youre high watching a movie or going to a concert is freaking awesomeThey also discuss whats not so good words like bad are taboo Spending too much I dont want to even think about that says Kevin the third member of the group who smoked multiple times a day as a freshman but has cut back to three or four times a week Lack of motivation scores too And anxiety If you have anxiety in your life regularly it amplifies it Ben offersAs students reveal their dislikes counselors listen intently for signs of selfmedication for anxiety depression attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder But mostly they listen for any hook that might motivate a student to cut backRelationship troubles caused by a partners disapproval of their marijuana use is a biggie says Rebecca Caldwell director of the substance abuse program in Wilmington So are slipping grades a factor motivating the three in Mr Bentleys session For an athlete it might be diminished lung capacityBecause marijuanas effects are subtle some students dont connect the dots with say feeling tired after a nights sleep Some dont want to see the connection Pot becomes part of who they are Oregon State University shut down its group program two years ago and now offers only individual sessions because participants were enabling one another says Robert C Reff director of the substance abuse programI ask Who are your friends How many smoke marijuana And they say All of them Ask students what has changed at the University of Colorado since legalization and most will say not muchBoulder has a long history with cannabis Hippies flocked to this oasis of independent thought drawn by a bustling music scene and student protests As the city morphed into a counterculture outpost and activist hotbed  passing strict environmental laws relaxing drug enforcement and opening one of the states first abortion clinics  getting high was not just a way to tune out but also a political statementThe only rules here are no rules Rob Pudim a resident told a Newsweek reporter in a 1980 piece entitled Where the Hip Meet to Trip The only people in town who arent comfortable he said are straight people who need boundariesThe campus still draws from afar Nearly 40 percent of its 26000 undergraduates are from out of state  a high percentage for a public university They are attracted by mountain adventure and a stunning setting The Flatirons the steep slabs of rock that dominate the landscape feel close enough to touch Many students are here because of the robust science programs CU is a member of the Association of American Universities an exclusive group of research institutions And because of its partyschool reputationOn a recent Friday a clutch of students and friends gather around a table garnished for an evening of casual indulgence beers playing cards tubes of medical marijuana and a bong All are 21 or almost there and from other statesSeveral voice sentiments that are shared in other corners of campus They didnt come here simply because its located in a permissive pot town but cannabis culture certainly played a role I could have went to a bunch of sweet public schools says Erik Mingo and I chose this one because I knew it was pretty accepted here I knew people had an open mindMr Mingo dropped out after the spring semester to work at a startup He has largely quit smoking and isnt indulging on this night I just didnt really need it anymore he explains It helped me relax and think about myself and the world and I just wasnt getting the same return His priority now is excelling at a demanding job he says I was moving on just naturally in my lifeThe campus is not under a cannabis cloud Sometimes one sees a lit joint in the open or a vape pen in class drawing ire from professors But students and others talk about a shift in how they view cannabis consumption Once an act of rebellion it no longer seems to hold symbolic power Now its just part of everyday life says Joseph Kaley 27 who graduated in 2009 and manages a Mexican restaurant on the Hill an offcampus gathering spot Mr Kaley attended three of the campuss famous April 20 smokeouts lighting up each time to protest marijuanas criminal status at the timeIn 2012 the university successfully shut down 420 saying it had grown so large it was disrupting academic life Many were angered particularly by the methods used to ward smokers away Workers spread smelly fish fertilizer on the quad and anyone without a student identification card was turned awayNew students when asked see the smokeout as a piece of quirky campus history Its just kind of fading from peoples memories says Wyatt Ryder 20 the chief of staff of the student government which last April held a symposium offering an allinclusive inside dive into the realm of cannabis cultureThe goal was to have a very nuanced discussion about marijuana said Caitlin Pratt 23 Mr Ryders colleague in student government Panelists discussed making money in the industry the effects of cannabis on the mind and efforts to legalize the substance in other states One of the most popular panels was led by Nolan Kane a CU professor attempting to map the cannabis genome to better understand marijuanas medical fuel and biotechnology potentialA few months later Mr Ryder attended a national conference for student government representatives He was accosted with questions  and jokes  about pot culture at his university Mr Ryder who doesnt even smoke was shocked to be appointed the conferences unofficial marijuana expertI just think its fascinating he said because to us in Colorado its not such a big deal But to other people its a major issue,2014-11-02T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/02/us/politics/ap-us-rethinking-pot-driving-stoned.html,WASHINGTON   New York teenager Joseph Beer smoked marijuana climbed into a Subaru Impreza with four friends and drove more than 100 mph before losing control The car crashed into trees with such force that the vehicle split in half killing his friendsBeer who was 17 in October 2012 when the crash occurred pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicular homicide and was sentenced last week to 5 years to 15 years in prisonAs states liberalize their marijuana laws public officials and safety advocates worry there will be more drivers high on pot and a big increase in traffic deaths Its not clear though whether those concerns are merited Researchers are divided on the question A prosecutor blamed the Beer crash on speed and weed but a jury that heard expert testimony on marijuanas effects at his trial deadlocked on a homicide charge and other felonies related to whether the teenager was impaired by marijuana Beer was convicted of manslaughter and reckless driving chargesStudies of marijuanas effects show that the drug can slow decisionmaking decrease peripheral vision and impede multitasking all of which are important driving skills But unlike with alcohol drivers high on pot tend to be aware that they are impaired and try to compensate by driving slowly avoiding risky actions such as passing other cars and allowing extra room between vehiclesOn the other hand combining marijuana with alcohol appears to eliminate the pot smokers exaggerated caution and to increase driving impairment beyond the effects of either substance aloneWe see the legalization of marijuana in Colorado and Washington as a wakeup call for all of us in highway safety said Jonathan Adkins executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association which represents state highway safety offices We dont know enough about the scope of marijuanaimpaired driving to call it a big or small problem But anytime a driver has their ability impaired it is a problemColorado and Washington are the only states that allow retail sales of marijuana for recreational use Efforts to legalize recreational marijuana are underway in Alaska Massachusetts New York Oregon and the District of Columbia Twentythree states and the nations capital permit marijuana use for medical purposesIt is illegal in all states to drive while impaired by marijuanaColorado Washington and Montana have set an intoxication threshold of 5 parts per billion of THC the psychoactive ingredient in pot in the blood A few other states have set intoxication thresholds but most have not set a specific level In Washington there was a jump of nearly 25 percent in drivers testing positive for marijuana in 2013  the first full year after legalization  but no corresponding increase in car accidents or fatalitiesDr Mehmet Sofuoglu a Yale University Medical School expert on drug abuse who testified at Beers trial said studies of marijuana and crash risk are highly inconclusive Some studies show a two or threefold increase while others show none he said Some studies even showed less risk if someone was marijuanapositive he testifiedTeenage boys and young men are the most likely drivers to smoke pot and the most likely drivers to have an accident regardless of whether theyre high he saidBeing a teenager a male teenager and being involved in reckless behavior could explain both at the same time  not necessarily marijuana causing getting into accidents but a general reckless behavior leading to both conditions at the same time Sofuoglu told jurorsIn 2012 just over 10 percent of high school seniors said they had smoked pot before driving at least once in the prior two weeks according to Monitoring the Future an annual University of Michigan survey of 50000 middle and high school students Nearly twice as many male students as female students said they had smoked marijuana before drivingA roadside survey by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2007 found 86 percent of drivers tested positive for THC but its not possible to say how many were high at the time because drivers only were tested for the presence of drugs not the amountA marijuana high generally peaks within a halfhour and dissipates within three hours but THC can linger for days in the bodies of habitual smokersInexperienced pot smokers are likely to be more impaired than habitual smokers who develop a tolerance Some studies show virtually no driving impairment in habitual smokersTwo recent studies that used similar data to assess crash risk came to opposite conclusionsColumbia University researchers compared drivers who tested positive for marijuana in the roadside survey with state drug and alcohol tests of drivers killed in crashes They found that marijuana alone increased the likelihood of being involved in a fatal crash by 80 percentBut because the study included states where not all drivers are tested for alcohol and drugs most drivers in fatal crashes were excluded possibly skewing the results Also the use of urine tests rather than blood tests in some cases may overestimate marijuana use and impairmentA Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation study used the roadside survey and data from nine states that test more than 80 percent of drivers killed in crashes When adjusted for alcohol and driver demographics the study found that otherwise sober drivers who tested positive for marijuana were slightly less likely to have been involved in a crash than drivers who tested negative for all drugsWe were expecting a huge impact said Eduardo Romano lead author of the study and when we looked at the data from crashes were not seeing that much But Romano said his study may slightly underestimate the risk and marijuana may lead to accidents caused by distractionMany states do not test drivers involved in a fatal crash for drugs unless there is reason to suspect impairment Even if impairment is suspected if the driver tests positive for alcohol there may be no further testing because alcohol alone may be enough to bring criminal charges Testing procedures also vary from state to stateIf states legalize marijuana they must set clear limits for impairment behind the wheel and require mandatory drug testing following a crash said Deborah Hersman former chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board Right now we have a patchwork system across the nation regarding mandatory drug testing following highway crashes___OnlineNational

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/us/03berkeley.html,BERKELEY Calif   Since the birth of the Free Speech Movement half a century ago this city has prided itself on its liberal values and policies be they generous benefits for the needy or a looktheotherway attitude toward marijuana useNow the city is bringing those policies together with a new amenity for the poor here The marijuana will be freeBeginning next August medical marijuana dispensaries in this city will be required to donate at least 2 percent of their cannabis to lowincome residents The City Council approved the requirement this summer  unanimously no less  with the hope of making the drug which can sell for up to 400 an ounce at dispensaries affordable for all residentsBut the charity cannabis mandate which city officials believe is the first such law provoked a swift backlash from critics who mocked it as a tiedyed fantasy in a city already famous for liberal experimentsInstead of taking steps to help the most economically vulnerable residents get out of that state the city has said Lets just get everybody high said John Lovell a lobbyist for the California Narcotic Officers AssociationMr Lovell said the free marijuana would sap patients motivation to look for work  after all it is not a drug known for encouraging anyone to get off the couch  and could easily be resold on the street for profit by people who are short on moneyI dont see anything progressive about that Mr Lovell saidTom Bates the mayor of Berkeley said the city was simply trying to ensure equal access to a drug he emphasized was medicine useful for treating cancer pain and other maladiesThere are some truly compassionate cases that need to have medical marijuana Mr Bates said But its expensive You hear stories about people dying from cancer who dont have the moneyMr Bates a former state legislator and football player at the University of California Berkeley has also championed home brewing and organic vegetables on school menus As for medical marijuana its a novel ideal to have it available to the poor he said Berkeley is sort of known for doing new thingsNearly 20 years after California became the first state to legalize medical cannabis Berkeleys new law highlights a paradox of marijuana as medicine Whether it is sold illegally on the street or legally in a dispensary access to the drug depends almost entirely on whether you can pay for itAlmost anyone with 40 to spare can find a doctor who will prescribe cannabis to treat insomnia or migraines or low appetite or something else but especially insomniaYet because marijuana remains illegal under federal law insurance companies refuse to cover such treatments which can run to hundreds of dollars per ounce for designer strains like All Star Sonoma Coma at local dispensariesIt is not as if marijuana medical or otherwise is tough to find here amid the vegan restaurants in downtown Berkeley and the smoke shops on Telegraph AvenueOn a recent Wednesday afternoon Joseph Skyler an undergraduate at the university here sat on the street with a group of homeless men who were making trinkets and jewelry to sell to tourists He was smoking marijuana that he said had been prescribed to him for insomniaI believe in living a certain kind of lifestyle thats very stress free Mr Skyler 23 said Ive noticed that just from smoking everyone calms downNo one else sitting with him had a medical cannabis card though that had hardly stopped them from smoking marijuana Mr Skyler said they should all have access to medical marijuanaThese people deserve it he said A lot of these guys have the same problems I haveAt least in the San Francisco Bay Area where marijuana is more socially accepted than cigarettes in some circles an informal network already exists to help lowincome people obtain medical cannabis Across the bay in San Francisco David Theisen 56 has relied on what he calls compassion a popular term for free medical cannabis to deal with insomniaAfter moving to the city several years ago he quickly learned the compassion schedule at several dispensaries which give away a few driedout buds to the first comers once or twice a month When one dispensary cut back said Mr Theisen a former line cook who remains unemployed he started going days without sleepingI cant afford to buy it but my need isnt any less than anyone elses he saidThe compassion system has now been formalized in Berkeley where city officials aim to provide lowincome patients with a more reliable supply of medical cannabis Only Berkeley residents are eligible for the free marijuana and they must show proof of income less than 32000 a year for individualsDispensaries which are prohibited by California law from turning a profit will also have to hire security guards to patrol nearby in order to deter crime though true to Berkeleys character the guards will not be allowed to carry firearmsOne of the citys largest dispensaries Berkeley Patients Group already gives away marijuana to patients who cannot pay One of them is Arnie Passman a poet and longtime Berkeley activist who has been a recipient for about a decade he could not remember exactly how long nor was he entirely sure what condition his prescription was meant to treatIt could be for my allergies or my arthritis  you know what happens to us folks We forget Mr Passman 78 said I can give it a blanket I feel better It helps me get going in the morningBut Sean Luse the dispensarys chief operating officer worries that the city mandate could lead to resale on the street Currently about 100 people not all of them Berkeley residents receive free marijuana from Berkeley Patients Group representing about 1 percent of the drug the facility dispenses The new law will now compel the dispensary to give away about twice as muchNo one has really quantified the legitimate demand they just set the 2 percent threshold out of thin air Mr Luse said Are we going to be forcing medicine on people just because its the law There could definitely be a financial incentive for folks to resell itMr Bates the mayor acknowledged that resale was possible but he waved away the question of whether there was enough demandTheres a huge demand  we could make it 20 percent he saidHe said he was more concerned with trying to regulate the safety and quality of the cannabis which is not tested or standardized by the state and varies substantially from one dispensary to anotherUnlike the lowgrade varieties often handed out by San Francisco dispensaries the free cannabis under the law in Berkeley must be of the same quality as the marijuana that customers pay for  ideally grown organically Mr Bates said without any pesticidesAnd despite the mocking from outside city limits on the streets of Berkeley no one voiced much objection to the new lawIf you believe marijuana is medicine then helping lowincome people purchase the medicine they need kind of makes sense to me said Bill Green 49 who works for a solar energy companyHe added that there was probably a lot of use of medical marijuana by people who dont really need it but that he saw an easy fix to that problem full legalizationIf the citys mandate is another step toward legalization for recreational use Mr Bates said then so much the betterI think what were seeing now is an evolution towards full legalization he said Its coming It may not be in the next few years but its coming,2014-09-03T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/opinion/high-time-rules-for-the-marijuana-market.html,As voters and lawmakers in more states decide to legalize marijuana policy makers will have to answer a fresh and difficult question How should governments regulate the production and sale of the drugBeyond keeping marijuana out of the hands of minors a good regulatory system has to limit the increase in drug abuse that is likely to accompany lower prices and greater availability after legalization It should protect consumers from both dangerous and counterfeit products reducing the physical risk from a psychoactive substance And a wellregulated system should undermine and eventually eliminate the black market for marijuana which has done great damage to societyThe experiences of Colorado and Washington where sales of recreational marijuana started this year will prove instructive While there are important differences in their approaches both states have licensed businesses to grow process and sell marijuana while imposing strict rules and high taxes on them Other states that legalize will probably adopt a similar model because it resembles how the federal and state governments regulate tobacco and alcoholA Better Way to Tax Policy makers trying to regulate the drug will face challenges similar to the ones American lawmakers faced at the end of Prohibition in 1933 Like alcohol during Prohibition marijuana is widely available across the United States today But it will become much more accessible after legalization when businesses engaged in its production and sale no longer operate in the black market nor engage in violence The pretax price of the drug could fall by 90 percent after legalization according to Robert MacCoun a law professor at Stanford and fellow researchers Moreover marijuana businesses will have a financial incentive to get a broad population to use the drug regularly A recent report prepared for the Colorado Department of Revenue concluded that nearly 90 percent of the demand for marijuana in the state this year would come from only 30 percent of users those who use the drug 21 to 31 days a monthRegulators will have to design policies that allow licensed businesses to undercut the illegal market but keep prices high enough so dependence on the drug does not increase a lot One important way to curb use is to tax marijuana heavily following the postProhibition template of replacing criminalization with regulation and taxes Colorado and Washington have imposed high tax rates that are based on price much like existing sales taxes But Mark Kleiman a public policy professor at the University of California Los Angeles rightly warns that those taxes will lose their bite when prices inevitably decline as marijuana businesses become more efficient at production A better approach would be to tax the drug based on its potency  which can be measured in various ways including by the amount of the component THC in a batch  and increase the rate over time to keep up with inflationLawmakers should not repeat the mistakes they made on alcohol in recent years taxing it too lightly and allowing the industry to become highly concentrated Just two companies control about 75 percent of the American beer market today Federal excise taxes on alcohol are levied at fixed rates by volume there are different rates for liquor wine and beer For example the tax on a 31gallon barrel of beer is 18 or 5 cents per 12ounce can But those tax rates were last increased in 1991 even though the Consumer Price Index has increased 75 percent since then Most states have also kept their excise taxes steady in recent years in part because of the heavy lobbying and big money of the beverage industry The median state excise tax on beer is 20 cents per gallon or about 2 cents per 12ounce canStates with an existing medical marijuana market will also have to make sure that users are not abusing it to evade taxes In Colorado for example there are more than 111000 people with medical marijuana cards Those users can buy the drug at much lower tax rates than people buying recreational marijuana in Denver cardholders pay combined city and state taxes of 762 percent compared with the 2112 percent in taxes paid by recreational usersThe problem is that almost anyone can get a card on a doctors recommendation Regulators need to tighten access to cards and penalize doctors who churn out recommendations by the hundreds Otherwise tax rates on recreational marijuana will be easily subvertedDont Market to Minors One of the most important lessons from the countrys long battle with the tobacco industry is advertisings outsize role in creating and sustaining an addiction to nicotine particularly among teenagers and young adults Though marijuana is far less addictive than tobacco states that choose to legalize it must impose limits on the promotional activities of marijuana businesses The controls should emulate the restrictions on targeting young people banning outdoor advertising and product placements that the tobacco industry accepted as part of its settlement with state attorneys general in 1998States must require proper labeling and packaging of products that contain mindaltering substances Beau Kilmer a drug policy expert at the RAND Corporation said regulators can restrict the sale of foods like candies beverages and cookies made with marijuana or limit how much of the drugs active ingredients are in each serving The ingredients should also be distributed evenly throughout the product and regulators must test samples for harmful levels of pesticides mold and other impurities often found in illicit cannabisTo discourage the use of marijuana with alcohol states can require that they be sold in different places and ban the use of cannabis at bars and restaurants Experts say using marijuana and alcohol together is much more dangerous than using them separately  One study on the effects of marijuana use on driving published in the American Journal on Addictions in 2009 found that combining the two drugs results in impairment even at doses which would be insignificant were they of either drug aloneGrowers Shouldnt Be Sellers States should keep the production and retail sales of marijuana separate to ensure that the industry does not evolve into a group of politically and financially powerful vertically integrated businesses After Prohibition American lawmakers adopted a threetier system for the alcohol industry to make sure the country did not see the return of tied houses or bars that were either owned or beholden to brewers through loans and other financial arrangements Tied houses had encouraged excessive drinking by their customers which helped to galvanize the temperance movement Colorado initially required growers to also be retailers in the interest of getting the legal market going quickly but has since allowed them to specializeOver time the state should consider dividing production and sales as Washington has done But states should not blindly copyandpaste alcohol regulations onto marijuana either State beer distribution rules for example have unfairly prevented craft brewers from selling their products in many places a situation that shouldnt be replicated in the marijuana businessFor each level of the industry licensing systems ought to discourage the concentration of market power in the hands of a few businesses Its important for regulators to recall the American experience with the tobacco industry which is dominated by a handful of large corporations For decades those big cigarette companies undermined scientific research into the damage their products were causing and blocked sensible regulations If states allow marijuana businesses to become too big they could face corporate juggernauts that may be hard to regulateStates should also monitor each level of the industry closely including tracking how drugs move through the system This should help to keep legal marijuana from being diverted to other states or countries that have not legalized the drugWhatever states decide to do it is important that they stand ready to modify policies as legal marijuana markets evolve Policy makers have little experience regulating a fully commercial market in this drug It makes sense for states to proceed with caution and reserve the right to change course as they learn more,2014-08-05T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/09/15/us/ap-us-marriage-and-marijuana.html,NEW YORK   While many liberal policy goals have proved elusive during Barack Obamas presidency there have been dramatic advances for two causes that once seemed quixotic  the legalization of samesex marriage and the decriminalization of marijuanaNeither cause was embraced by Obama during his first term Yet he is now a fervent supporter of marriage equality and has said it is important that Colorado and Washington state be allowed to proceed with their pioneering laws approved by voters in 2012 that legalize marijuanaFor both issues the pace of change has been strikingThere are now 19 states that allow gay marriage compared to two in 2008 Bans in the remaining states are being struck down by federal judges at a rapid rate that could presage a Supreme Court ruling legalizing it nationwideAs for marijuana in November voters in Oregon Alaska and the District of Columbia will weigh in on ballot measures that would emulate Colorado and Washington by legalizing recreational use of pot by adults A ballot measure in Florida could add that state to the 23 others which have legalized medical use of marijuana including 10 in the past four yearsWhats distinctive about the marriage and marijuana campaigns is that theyve been able to proceed at the state level unencumbered by the paralyzing gridlock in Congress In contrast efforts by Obama and his Democratic allies to overhaul the immigration system tighten gun control laws raise the federal minimum wage and combat climate change have run aground in the partisan divides on Capitol HillThe paramount Obama initiative that did clear Congress  his health care overhaul  remains entangled in various controversies and its longterm legacy is uncertain On immigration and many of the other issues hes resorting to unilateral executive action often angering his critics on the right while failing to fully satisfy activists on the leftGiven those realities Richard Socarides a former Clinton White House adviser on gay rights makes a case that samesex marriage and other gayrights advances represent a singular achievement for progressives during the Obama presidencyBarack Obama has accomplished more progressive social change on gay rights than anything else Socarides saidDuring his first term Obama helped change military policy so gays could serve openly but said his views on samesex marriage were still evolving Under constant pressure from gayrights activists he endorsed it in 2012 and since then his administration has moved aggressively to maximize federal recognition of married gay couples even in states that ban samesex marriageThe reason why he has that record now is because publicly and privately we really held his feet to the fire said Socarides referring to the activists pressureObamas stance on marijuana is far more nuanced Marijuana remains illegal under federal law and the White Houserun Office of National Drug Control Policy opposes its legalization whether for medicinal or recreational useYet in August 2013 addressing the developments in Colorado and Washington the Justice Department said it would allow legalization efforts to proceed as long as states followed strict guidelines including keeping pot away from minors Obama an acknowledged pot smoker in his younger days subsequently told The New Yorker magazine that he doesnt view marijuana as any more dangerous than alcohol and explained his acceptance of the Colorado and Washington initiativesIts important for it to go forward because its important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punished he told the magazineEthan Nadelmann executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance and a leading critic of the socalled war on drugs said such comments  coupled with the Justice Departments 2013 memo  have put Obama out in front of most congressmen and governorsI wouldnt call it bold but it is significant Nadelmann said of Obamas stance which has paved the way for other states to consider joining the legalization movementNadelmann drew a contrast between the marijuana movement  which he predicted would gain increasing bipartisan support  and issues such as immigration and gun control where partisan divides are pronouncedMarijuana lies at a unique intersection he said Its a civil rightscivil liberties cause and at the same time theres the emergence of a legal market that could be worth tens of billions of dollarsNeera Tanden of the Center for American Progress a liberal think tank said the changes unfolding at the state level on marriage and marijuana reflect evolving public opinion and the growing influence of 18to29yearolds Among millennials support for gay marriage and legalized pot is stronger than for other age groupsYou have a country that is diversifying and at same time you have a House of Representatives that is kind of a block against the wishes of the rising majority said Tanden the CAPs president Immigration reform passed the Senate then hit a wall on the steps of the HouseWith conservative Republicans likely to maintain power in the House for at least two more years Tanden said a statebystate approach is being pursued on some other progressivebacked issues For example measures to raise the state minimum wage will be on the Nov 4 ballot in Alaska Arkansas Nebraska and South Dakota while several cities and two states  California and Connecticut  have recently instituted policies to provide some workers with paid sick daysThese are issues that eventually will pass nationally Tanden saidConservative commentator Jonah Goldberg contends that Obama could have pushed more of his agenda through Congress if hed been more skillful politically and more willing to give Republicans a meaningful roleHe doesnt know how to play that game Goldberg said Now youve got gridlock and the things hes been able to do are things a president can do unilaterallyOthers defend Obamas effortsHis stances on marriage and marijuana will guarantee him a very strong progressive legacy said Ethan Geto a gayrights lobbyist and Democratic political consultant in New YorkHe wants to do the right thing on immigration but its an incredible minefield He pushed hard on gun control Geto said I dont see any of these major issues where he hasnt done as much as realistically expected___,2014-09-15T11:30:42Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/opinion/high-time-times-readers-online-make-their-own-cases-for-legalizing-marijuana.html,WE learned something about New York Times online commenters recently They are far far more supportive of marijuana legalization than the average AmericanOver the last 10 days The Timess Editorial Board published a series calling for an end to the federal ban on marijuana This stance we realized was hardly avantgarde As we noted in an essay on public views a majority of Americans now favor legalizing use of the drug But this majority is not especially large 54 percent to 42 percent according to the Pew Research Centers latest pollIn the comments section of the High Time series we asked readers to state their preference for legalization against it or unsure Obviously combing through Internet comments wont yield results that are publishable in a scientific journal Still the lopsided response seems to indicate that Times readers  at least readers of the online edition  overwhelmingly believe that prohibition is pointlessAs of Tuesday afternoon roughly 15000 comments were published online on seven editorials 12658 were for 982 against and 254 unsure Not everyone chose a category And letters to the editor by contrast were far more mixedBy and large readers seem to support legalization for the same reasons the editorial writers do They are convinced marijuana is less dangerous than alcohol and tobacco and believe that the criminalization of marijuana is more likely to ruin lives than marijuana itself Arrest and incarceration for possession of a relatively harmless substance is to many readers unacceptableMark Hanna of Virginia summed up the consensus view Like many wars the war on drugs has caused too much carnage Lets responsibly legalize marijuanaKyle of Oklahoma made the same point in more detail No matter how bad you think marijuana is for kids teens or adults the fact is that arrest incarceration and the ruin they bring is worse The question is not whether marijuana is OK It is how to effectively deal with it Illegality and moral censure are and should remain separate tools  I think many people are worried about losing control of their kids but I dont think a single one of them wants to see their kid locked upAnd Justine a nurse in Portland Ore wrote from personal experience I have yet to see one patient come through our doors suffering the longterm consequence of pot use Not one Alcohol I cant even begin to count And when they do it is very ugly Patients in the ER because someone smoked a couple of joints and got violent Not so muchNot surprisingly commenters did advance arguments that the Editorial Board overlooked or touched upon only in passing Some including Daniel of Alabama supported legalization on ideological libertarian grounds I reject the federal governments right to decide what I put in my body Even if it was bad for you so what We dont ban skydiving driving in cars hunting professional backyard wrestling traveling to 3rd world countries sugary foods and beverages standing outside during thunderstorms with a metal pole swimming after eating caffeine ibuprofen alcohol cigarettes or prescription drugs all of which are statistically more likely to harm youOther readers endorsed legalization as a way to reduce the power of drug cartels Pedro a reader in Mexico City explained In Mexico we have a bloody war against drugs  This prohibition has done nothing but destroy people by putting them in jail Drug dealers killing each other for territory etc There are more cartels than there were when the prohibition started This prohibition has only empowered drug dealers I say let cannabis be free Stop benefiting the cartelsInstead of allowing gangs to profit from marijuana some readers suggested that local governments could patch up their budgets by taxing the drug In this era of dwindling coffers wrote Kelli Dunaway of St Louis it seems that the regulation sale and taxation of marijuana offers some badly needed fiscal relief In my state that may be the only argument with any impactALTHOUGH the vast majority of readers wrote in support of legalization there was of course some dissent There were readers who considered the series downright reckless and who questioned our prioritiesRobert Jackson of Denver said we need to put the needs of Americas youth ahead of the needs of people who want to get stoned He dismissed the notion that pot is a safe and harmless drug as the product of a wellfunded blitzkrieg propaganda campaign and called the argument that alcohol is more dangerous than marijuana a propaganda tactic of distraction Sam Coulter of New York was more blunt Arguing marijuana should be legal just because alcohol is legal is just plain stupidWe expected some readers to make the slipperyslope case against legalizing marijuana and they did Keval Parekh of New Jersey wrote sarcastically Sure Democrats lets fully legalize marijuana  And while were at it how about cocaine meth heroin and LSD But he also took a rather surprising position He called on Republicans to end their hypocritical stance on alcohol and tobacco  They should come out as against ALL types of drugs including alcohol and tobaccoMr Parekh was not the only reader to recommend doublingdown on prohibition Susan of Boston identified herself as someone who thinks tobacco smoking should be outlawedSomehow we dont anticipate repeal the 21st amendment ban tobacco working as a slogan on the campaign trail certainly any candidate who suggested blanket prohibition would lose The Timess readership In fact many readers argued that legalization  rather than continued or broader prohibition  was the political winner They noticed the nearunanimity in the comments section and perhaps getting a little carried away imagined hopeandchange emanating from the White HouseChris of Virginia had some advice for President Obama He should use executive authority to legalize marijuana on a national level and let each state decide their own laws This could be an opportunity for Pres Obama to cement his legacy and give the nation what it clearly desiresThe president would at least be giving a majority of Times commenters what they clearly desire,2014-08-06T00:00:00Z,drugs

Sachss business acumen and profit have long been the envy of Wall Street Now however the company is facing questions about whether it will be able to maintain its place atop the financial industry in a new era of regulations that hit hardest the very businesses like trading where Goldman makes the most money DealBooks Nathaniel Popper writes Among Wall Street analysts Goldman has been losing its favored position And while Goldman is expected to report higher profit than it did a year ago when it reports its thirdquarter results much of the banks recent success has come from divisions that are expected to shrink as new regulations are phased inAnalysts and some investors say they are concerned that lawmakers may continue to come down harder on Goldman than on its competitors most of which are not as reliant on Wall Street activities But the concerns have not stopped the bank from churning out profit Mr Popper writes Since analysts began downgrading Goldmans stock the share price has continued to outperform many of its peers The stock is up 37 percent so far this year And though the companys executives have curtailed some business lines hit hardest by the new rules they are also dismissive of the notion that the bank needs to be fundamentally reshaped to be as successful as it has been in the past Across the Atlantic Goldman is facing another kind of difficulty A judge in Londons High Court ordered Goldman on Tuesday to pay some of the Libyan Investment Authoritys costs for fighting the banks efforts to dismiss a lawsuit that the authority filed against Goldman in

lawyers suggested the entire book should be submitted as evidence And it wasDavid Boies the lawyer for Maurice R Greenberg the former AIG chief executive who has sued the government for 40 billion contending the Federal Reserve shortchanged shareholders in 2008 gave copies to the Justice Departments lawyers and Mr Geithner The strategy was carefully orchestrated Mr Greenbergs side believes that much of what Mr Geithner has said in his book  and which he therefore cannot dispute during the trial without hurting his own credibility  helps the shareholders case according to people briefed on the legal strategy Mr Greenbergs lawyers also obtained transcripts of the unpublished interviews the former Treasury secretary gave to people assisting him with putting together Stress Test Under questioning from Mr Boies Mr Geithner said the aftershocks from the collapse of Lehman Brothers were very much on my mind during those critical days in September 2008 when he served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and that the subsequent failure of AIG would have been catastrophic for the economy possibly even more damaging than Lehman Mr Boies and Mr Geithner also engaged

Sachss business acumen and profit have long been the envy of Wall Street Now however the company is facing questions about whether it will be able to maintain its place atop the financial industry in a new era of regulations that hit hardest the very businesses like trading where Goldman makes the most money DealBooks Nathaniel Popper writes Among Wall Street analysts Goldman has been losing its favored position And while Goldman is expected to report higher profit than it did a year ago when it reports its thirdquarter results much of the banks recent success has come from divisions that are expected to shrink as new regulations are phased inAnalysts and some investors say they are concerned that lawmakers may continue to come down harder on Goldman than on its competitors most of which are not as reliant on Wall Street activities But the concerns have not stopped the bank from churning out profit Mr Popper writes Since analysts began downgrading Goldmans stock the share price has continued to outperform many of its peers The stock is up 37 percent so far this year And though the companys executives have curtailed some business lines hit hardest by the new rules they are also dismissive of the notion that the bank needs to be fundamentally reshaped to be as successful as it has been in the past Across the Atlantic Goldman is facing another kind of difficulty A judge in Londons High Court ordered Goldman on Tuesday to pay some of the Libyan Investment Authoritys costs for fighting the banks efforts to dismiss a lawsuit that the authority filed against Goldman in January Jenny Anderson writes in DealBook The authority has estimated its costs at about 1 million The authority Libyas sovereign wealth fund is suing Goldman over 12 billion worth of derivative

much of what Mr Geithner has said in his book  and which he therefore cannot dispute during the trial without hurting his own credibility  helps the shareholders case according to people briefed on the legal strategy Mr Greenbergs lawyers also obtained transcripts of the unpublished interviews the former Treasury secretary gave to people assisting him with putting together Stress Test Under questioning from Mr Boies Mr Geithner said the aftershocks from the collapse of Lehman Brothers were very much on my mind during those critical days in September 2008 when he served as president of

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/opinion/high-time-federal-marijuana-ban-is-rooted-in-myth.html,The federal law that makes possession of marijuana a crime has its origins in legislation that was passed in an atmosphere of hysteria during the 1930s and that was firmly rooted in prejudices against Mexican immigrants and AfricanAmericans who were associated with marijuana use at the time This racially freighted history lives on in current federal policy which is so driven by myth and propaganda that it is almost impervious to reasonThe cannabis plant also known as hemp was widely grown in the United States for use in fabric during the mid19th century The practice of smoking it appeared in Texas border towns around 1900 brought by Mexican immigrants who cultivated cannabis as an intoxicant and for medicinal purposes as they had done at homeWithin 15 years or so it was plentiful along the Texas border and was advertised openly at grocery markets and drugstores some of which shipped small packets by mail to customers in other statesThe law enforcement view of marijuana was indelibly shaped by the fact that it was initially connected to brown people from Mexico and subsequently with black and poor communities in this country Police in Texas border towns demonized the plant in racial terms as the drug of immoral populations who were promptly labeled fiendsAs the legal scholars Richard Bonnie and Charles Whitebread explain in their authoritative history The Marihuana Conviction the drugs popularity among minorities and other groups practically ensured that it would be classified as a narcotic attributed with addictive qualities it did not have and set alongside far more dangerous drugs like heroin and morphineBy the early 1930s more than 30 states had prohibited the use of marijuana for nonmedical purposes The federal push was yet to comeThe stage for federal suppression of marijuana was set in New Orleans where a prominent doctor blamed muggleheads  as pot smokers were called  for an outbreak of robberies The city was awash in sensationalistic newspaper articles that depicted pushers hovering by the schoolhouse door turning children into addicts These stories popularized spurious notions about the drug that lingered for decades Law enforcement officials too trafficked in the assassin theory under in which killers were said to have smoked cannabis to ready themselves for murder and mayhemIn 1930 Congress consolidated the drug control effort in the Federal Bureau of Narcotics led by the endlessly resourceful commissioner Harry Jacob Anslinger who became the architect of national prohibition His case rested on two fantastical assertions that the drug caused insanity that it pushed people toward horrendous acts of criminality Others at the time argued that it was fiercely addictiveHe may not have actually believed his propaganda but he fed it by giving lurid stories to the press as a way of making a case for federal intervention This narrative had a great effect at Congressional hearings that led to the enactment of The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 which tried to eradicate the use and sale of the drug through heavy taxationMr Bonnie and Mr Whitebread report that the witness list for those hearings contained not a single person who had done significant research into the effects of cannabis Mr Anslinger testified that even a single marijuana cigarette could induce a homicidal mania prompting people to want to kill those they loved The bill passed handily President Franklin Roosevelt signed it into lawIt was not until 1951 when Congress again took up the issue that a reputable researcher was called to testify Dr Harris Isbell director of research at the Public Health Service Hospital in Lexington Ky disputed the insanity crime and addiction theories telling Congress that smoking marijuana has no unpleasant aftereffects no dependence is developed on the drug and the practice can easily be stopped at any timeDespite Dr Isbells testimony Congress ratcheted up penalties on users The states followed the federal example Louisiana for instance created sentences ranging from five to 99 years without parole or probation for sale possession or administration of narcotic drugs The rationale was not that marijuana itself was addictive  that argument was suddenly relinquished  but that it was a steppingstone to heroin addiction This passed largely without comment at the timeThe country accepted a senselessly punitive approach to sentencing as long as minorities and the poor paid the price But by the late 1960s weed had been taken up by white college students from the middle and upper classes Seeing white lives ruined by marijuana laws altered public attitudes about harsh sentencing and in 1972 the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse released a report challenging the approachThe commission concluded that criminalization was too harsh a tool to apply to personal possession even in the effort to discourage use and that the actual and potential harm of use of the drug is not great enough to justify intrusion by the criminal law into private behavior a step which our society takes only with the greatest reluctance The Nixon administration dismissed these ideasDuring the mid1970s virtually all states softened penalties for marijuana possession Thirtyfive states and the District of Columbia have made medical use of some form of the drug legal The Justice Departments recent decision not to sue states that legalize marijuana  as long as they have strong enforcement rules  eases the tension between state and federal laws only slightly but leaves a great many legal problems unresolvedThe federal government has taken a small step back from irrational enforcement But it clings to a policy that has its origins in racism and xenophobia and whose principal effect has been to ruin the lives of generations of

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/opinion/sunday/high-time-the-public-lightens-up-about-weed.html,When Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992 he admitted that he had experimented with marijuana but said he didnt like it didnt inhale it and never tried it again Whatever the accuracy of that statement he was accused of pandering to the marijuanawary voting publicFlash forward to the early stages of the 2008 presidential campaign At an event in Iowa thencandidate Barack Obama disclosed that he had not only smoked marijuana as a young man but inhaled it too That was the point he said The public responded with a shrugBetween the two campaigns Americans had loosened up considerably By the time Mr Obama was wooing voters in Iowa Nancy Reagans just say no slogan was a relic of a fustier era and Weeds a comedy about a widowed mother who sells marijuana to support her family was on TV Few people remembered Judge Douglas Ginsburg who in 1987 had to withdraw from consideration as a Supreme Court justice after admitting that he had used marijuana while a professor at Harvard Law SchoolSeventyeight percent of Americans thought marijuana should be illegal in 1991 That figure fell to 57 percent in 2008 according to the Pew Research Center In 2013 for the first time in over four decades of polling on the issue prohibition was a minority position Fiftytwo percent said they favored legalizing marijuana use 45 percent were opposedIt seems likely that the legalization majority will continue to grow Pews latest survey says 54 percent of Americans now support legalization That includes 52 percent of baby boomers who opposed legalization in the 1980s and 69 percent of millennials As with samesex marriage young people do not seem to understand what all the fuss is about On these two social issues theyre libertariansSo what happened How did we get from just say no to no big deal from I didnt inhale to that was the point Americans are not on the whole more liberal politically than they used to be  Gallup polling on ideological selfidentification has been quite consistent for 20 years They simply appear to have come around to the view that the war on marijuana is more harmful than marijuana itselfNearly threequarters of Americans 72 percent say government efforts to enforce marijuana laws cost more than they are worth Even Republicans who tend to be more skeptical of legalization overwhelmingly hold that opinion 67 percent And a shrinking share of the population believes marijuana is a gateway substance that leads to harder drugs 38 percent in 2013 versus 60 percent in 1977 or that marijuana use is morally wrong 32 percent in 2013 down 18 points since 2006Starting with California in the mid1990s Americans have seen state after state legalize the drug for medical use  and two states legalize it for general use  without enduring fire and brimstone Theyve heard about ordinary people arrested on possession charges who cannot find jobs because of their criminal record And theyve read statistics showing a persistent racial bias in enforcement Black citizens are nearly four times as likely as white people to be arrested for possessionPerhaps Americans have also been swayed by the array of public figures who have spoken out against prohibition Pat Robertson the founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network told The Times in 2012 that we should treat marijuana the way we treat beverage alcohol Ive never used marijuana and I dont intend to he added but its just one of those things that I think This war on drugs just hasnt succeeded Bob Barr a former congressman and Grover Norquist president of Americans for Tax Reform signed a letter to Congress in 2009 arguing that each state should have the right to dictate its own marijuana policy Giving states this authority they said would free federal law enforcement resources for the more urgent tasks of thwarting apprehending and prosecuting international terrorists or murderersBut Americans are not deriving their opinions on marijuana just from the media Fortyeight percent of respondents told Pew in 2013 that they had tried marijuana up from 38 percent a decade earlier One in 10 said they had used the drug in the last year Someone whos tried marijuana is unlikely to succumb to Reefer Madnessstyle fearmongering or to less hysterical but equally invalid ideas about the medical risks of occasional use Roughly seven in 10 Americans believe alcohol is more detrimental to a persons health which is what the scientific establishment believesThis isnt the first time the nation seemed to be heading toward more liberal marijuana laws In 1972 the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse unanimously recommended decriminalization in 1977 President Jimmy Carter asked Congress to accept that advice But there was a backlash movement led in part by suburban parents worried that weed was turning their children into layaboutsAmericans still associate smoking marijuana with apathy Theres a whole subgenre of Hollywood comedies devoted to stoned antics like Pineapple Express or the Harold and Kumar series which keep alive the impression that weed is the drug of choice of young people whod rather sit on the couch eating snacks than grow up and get a job Only a minority of Americans now think its the governments responsibility to discourage that behavior through the criminal justice system A majority believe that the war on marijuana has failed and that its time to end itOn Monday at 420 pm Eastern Time Andrew Rosenthal the editorial page editor will

hours southwest of Denver takes a bicycle and a few minutes On Main Street and nearby blocks you will pass a WalMart a pizza place called PieZans a bikerepairandespresso shop the offices of The Gunnison Country Times the campus of Western State Colorado University and Traders Rendezvous which claims to have the states largest collection of antlers and mounted animal trophies Ride long enough and you will find seven churches and five liquor stores six if you count the SafewayWhat you will not find are any stores selling marijuana These are not allowedTo see the new Colorado after Amendment 64 which legalized recreational cannabis you have to drive a halfhour north to Crested Butte It has three dispensaries selling marijuana buds and pipes and cannabisinfused candies and drinks They are off the main drag their presence is lowkey even deferentialThe towns are not drastically different Crested Butte population 1550 is for skiers and tourists its main street is more colorfully painted more selfconsciously alpine Gunnison population 5854 has deep roots in ranching and mining Its for hunters towing ATVs students and underpaid faculty members at the university and highcaliber athletes devoted to the strenuous life A classic Gunnison sight is a 6000 mountain bike racked atop a 700 SubaruThe towns are divided by marijuana now but many in Gunnison expect a change is gonna come Voters will be deciding in November whether to legalize marijuana sales within the city limits and if so whether to tax them The city voted down medical marijuana stores in 2011 But just a year later Gunnison County which includes the city voted 67 percent in favor of Amendment 64 To many in Gunnison that is a sign that the world has turnedThis is how it feels in Colorado in Denver and beyond Even people and places not overeager to embrace marijuana are not cowed by legalization Seven months after plunging into the whatif world of legal marijuana Colorado feels years ahead of the rest of the country in cannabis understanding If you go to Colorado as many outoftown reporters have armed with adolescent stoner jokes you should know that Cheech and Chong were famous 40 years ago Many of the advocates and entrepreneurs leading the revolution are in their 20s and 30s and will not relate And the majority of Coloradans who are going on with their lives living apart from the world of weed will not find you funnyGunnison has two wouldbe ganjapreneurs Jason Roland and Todd Houle pressing for legalization so they can open a store The closest they have to an adversary might be Matthew Kuehlhorn director of the Gunnison County Substance Abuse Prevention Project which works in the public schools He puts himself on the tolerant end of those who want to discourage marijuana use and refuses to exaggerate its dangers You cant get the toothpaste back in the tube he said So now were finding ways to reduce harm and continue on forward He wants marijuana taxes to be earmarked for youth programs Mr Roland and Mr Houle agree The City Council isnt so sureThe real drug problem in town several Gunnisonians said is alcohol  no surprise in a skiingranchingcollege town Western State Colorado University has had to live down a reputation as a party school locals call it Wasted State and officials there do not think legal marijuana is going to help The dean of students Gary Pierson said the school tries hard to send a drugfree message Even authorized medicalmarijuana users have to medicate offcampusI asked Chris Dickey publisher of The Country Times whether his paper had editorialized for or against Amendment 64 He couldnt remember We have other issues Its a small town the economys always kind of limping along The environmental issues are always a pressing concern The status of our local education institutions Those are the things that impact peoples livesGeorge Sibley a writer who came to the Gunnison Valley in the 1960s said the key to grasping local politics in the Mountain West is knowing your altitude Above 8000 feet its almost always Democrat and downvalley its almost always Republican he said Downvalley its more agricultural selfreliant Jeffersoniantype Republicanism But upvalley it was miners originally and union people and then it became posturban liberals with urban backgroundsBy this theory Crested Butte at 8885 feet breathes solidly liberal air Gunnison at 7703 feet is more in the zone of political flux Mr Sibley said he expected legalization to win which suited him fine But he said there was a silent faction in town how big he wasnt sure that would vote against marijuana shops simply to preserve the status quoI actually think itll be slow Mr Sibley said But life will not be very much different There will be a significant new tax source for the community and everybody will be even more used to it than they are now Youre never going to stop it of course because if you put a challenge in front of a bunch of high school kids He

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/opinion/sunday/high-time-the-great-colorado-weed-experiment.html,In January Colorado defied the federal government and stepped with both feet into the world of legal recreational marijuana where no state had gone beforeFor seven months Coloradans have been lawfully smoking joints and inhaling cannabis vapors chewing marijuanalaced candies and chocolates drinking cooking and lotioning with products infused with cannabis oil They are growing their own weed making their own hash oil and stocking up at dispensaries marked with green crosses and words like health wellness and natural remedies Tourists are joining in  gawking sampling and tripping in hotel rooms Business is growing taxes are flowing cannabis entrepreneurs are building investing and cashing inCannabis sales from January through May brought the state about 236 million in revenue from taxes licenses and fees That is not a huge amount in a 24 billion budget but its a lot more than zero and its money that was not pocketed by the black marketThe criminal justice system is righting itself Marijuana prosecutions are way down across the state  The Denver Post found a 77 percent drop in January from the year before Given the immense waste in dollars and young lives of unjust marijuana enforcement that far too often targets black men this may be the most hopeful trend of allThe striking thing to a visitor is how quickly the marijuana industry has receded into normality  cannabis storefronts are plentiful in Denver but not obtrusive certainly not in the way liquor stores often are Marijuanagrowing operations are in unmarked warehouses on the citys industrial edgesThe ominously predicted harms from legalization  like blight violence soaring addiction rates and other ills  remain imaginary worries Burglaries and robberies in Denver in fact are down from a year ago The surge of investment and of jobs in construction tourism and other industries on the other hand is realLegal Safe and Taxed This is what the people of Colorado voted for overwhelmingly in amending the State Constitution in 2012 to regulate marijuana like alcohol a shrewd frame that placed a major social shift firmly in the nobrainer category The promise of Amendment 64 is a flood of tax revenue for education drug abuse prevention and research  with as much as 40 million for school construction every year and 10 million for studying marijuanas therapeutic and medical benefits In a state where medical marijuana has been legal since 2000 doing little evident harm the move to legalize recreational use was seen by most voters as a sensible next stepThough Gov John Hickenlooper opposed Amendment 64 he admits that the debate is over  that this is a goodgovernment issue now and his administration is trying to making legalization work The state government began the year well prepared swiftly erecting a system to regulate the new business and to enforce the web of laws that strictly limit where you can use cannabis who can buy it and how products are made marketed and sold A digital inventory system tracks every plant from seed to sale The law forbids public consumption and selling to those under 21 Stings by state regulators recently found 100 percent of targeted shops in Denver and Pueblo complying with the underage law Police are cracking down on nuisance publicsmoking violations but arent wasting time chasing otherwiselawabiding usersTo keep stoned drivers off the roads the state is expanding to 300 the number of lawenforcement officers trained as drugrecognition experts Combating drugged driving is complicated because there are no instant roadside tests for marijuana and results might be meaningless anyway regular users can have blood concentration levels of THC the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis well over Colorados legal limit of five nanograms per milliliter and drive perfectly well and marijuana can be detectable weeks after a high has worn off Research on the dangers of mixing marijuana and driving is scant but so is evidence that legal cannabis makes the highways more dangerous The Colorado State Patrol reported in April that fatal crashes in the first quarter of 2014 were down 255 percent from the year beforeThe Problem of Edibles  Cannabis advocates were caught off guard in the first months after legalization by complaints about the risks of overdosing on cannabisinfused food and drinks Thanks to highpotency oils a single chocolate bar or bottle of soda can contain enough THC to get several people high An unwitting user may not realize this until an hour or two after eating or drinking too muchA handful of emergencyroom visits by children sickened by edibles prompted the state in May to tighten the labeling laws requiring products to be clearly marked as marijuana Last Thursday it enacted an emergency rule requiring edibles to be divided  or easily dividable  into single servings containing no more than 10 milligrams of THC But how to label single pieces of candy or keep tempting sweets away from children are lingering questionsLegalization opponents have seized on two highly publicized deaths in Colorado possibly linked to edibles  a visiting student ate some cannabis cookies and jumped off a balcony a man is accused of fatally shooting his wife after ingesting marijuana candy and possibly painkillers But these anecdotes fall short of a persuasive argument for renewed prohibition and there is still no evidence that THC even in large amounts is even close to being as lethal as alcohol or tobaccoTo discourage minors from using marijuana the state is spending 17 million on youth prevention and education An ad campaign aimed at 12 to 15yearolds who are seen as more open to persuasion than older teenagers is being unveiled this month It will focus on marijuanas potential risk to growing brains using props like giant rat cages and the slogan Dont be a lab rat The state says its deterrence campaign is honest and scientifically sound Still some critics are skeptical citing a long history of ineffective antidrug campaigns and a century of hysteria and shaky evidence about marijuanas dangersLessons Beyond the Rockies The Colorado model of medicalization and legalization is a model that is designed around continuous input and continuous adjustments said Christian Sederberg a lawyer at a Denver firm dedicated to marijuana law and advocacy Other states will be keeping a close eye on those adjustmentsWashington State which approved legalization by a ballot initiative in 2012 got its first recreational dispensaries in July It is following a different model with far stricter controls on advertising and public displays and a tight licensing process that so far has allowed relatively few marijuana stores to open with limited supplies at very high prices How well legalization will drive out illegal operations in Washington is not yet clear Seattle has such abundant and cheap blackmarket weed pot shops may end up being only a tourist noveltyThirtyfive states and the District of Columbia have laws allowing some form of medical marijuana Alaska and Oregon will put full legalization before the voters this fall Industry lobbyists are hoping to have legalization initiatives on ballots in up to six states in 2016Advocates are trying to make California one of them It was the first state to legalize medical marijuana in 1996 and thus has the longest history with an open cannabis culture Many call it de facto legalization because medical marijuana ID cards are laughably easy to get While Californias experience shows the downsides of ineffectual laws and lax enforcement it has not turned the state into a story of rampant addiction crime or community upheaval Support for full legalization there has grown as dire predictions of disaster made over two decades have not been borne outA similar dissonance exists in the Netherlands which for years has tolerated  though never legalized  recreational marijuana in order to separate users of soft drugs from users of hardcore opiates Its system is an awkward mix of tolerance and criminality The countrys cannabis cafes have to rely on blackmarket weed and as cities have grown weary of pot tourism they have tried in the face of great resistance to restrict use to residentsUruguay meanwhile recently became the first country to regulate marijuana growing and selling nationwide through a system in which the price is statecontrolled and everyone involved  sellers distributors buyers  must be a citizen and licensed by the government The goal is to end the narcotraffickers monopoly and drug violence The success of this approach and applicability to the United States has yet to be shownSo Far So Good  Beyond the challenges of edible cannabis and parental anxiety the problems facing Colorado are mostly prosaic and fixable  or out of its handsAt a cannabis conference in Denver in June some panelists were asked to consider existential threats to their industry like the danger that some future crackdown could send them all to federal prison They ruefully acknowledged that possibility but expressed hope that momentum in the states would soon become unstoppable sweeping even the executive branch and Congress in the right direction For now their experiment remains firmly on the rails and moving along with public opinion toward a future ever further from the failed war on drugsRelated Editorial Observer on the debate in two towns in Colorado

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/14/us/politics/marijuana-decriminalization-in-washington-dc-is-contested-by-federal-lawmakers.html,WASHINGTON   A law to make marijuana possession in the District of Columbia punishable by only a 25 ticket one of the laxest drug laws in the nation has ignited a feud between Washingtons mayor and a Republican House member days before it is to take effectMayor Vincent C Gray urged district residents to boycott the beaches and resort towns of Marylands Eastern Shore after its congressman moved to block the citys marijuanafriendly law claiming more teenagers will take up drug useHe is interfering with democracy in this city and we want people to understand how we feel about it the mayor said in an interview He pointed out that Maryland like the district decriminalized marijuana this year and if the congressman Representative Andy Harris had been in the legislature he would have been outvotedMarijuana has potent political symbolism in this city with a large black population because the vast majority of arrests here for possession is of blacks But at issue is more than marijuana Infringements on Washingtons home rule hits an eversensitive nerve setting off howls of hypocrisy and tyranny in a city whose license plates read Taxation Without RepresentationA city of liberal voters the district has long had prickly relations with conservative members of Congress who set up parttime housekeeping here and thanks to the Constitution get a big say in local affairsThese are things people cant even do in their own home states and they use the District of Columbia to make an example out of us Mr Gray saidCity officials accuse federal lawmakers of grandstanding for voters back home or nationallyTheres a long tradition of people trying to score points off of us said David Catania a District of Columbia council memberIn recent years conservative Republicans have stopped the city from implementing a needle exchange program to slow the spread of HIV a registry of gay domestic partners and medical marijuana All eventually went forward sometimes after a decade of obstructionMr Catania accused Mr Harris of seeking to enhance his bona fides in a campaign for leadership of the Republican Study Committee a group that seeks to pull the House further right The chairmanship opened in a House leadership shuffle after the primary defeat of Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia who resigned as majority leader Mr Harris who is a physician won his seat in 2010 after a State Senate career in which he was known for opposing lateterm abortions as well as Xrated movies at the University of MarylandHe denied a political motive in opposing marijuana decriminalization If I were looking to advance my position among the broad spectrum of Republicans this is probably not the way to do it he saidHis objection to the districts law is because it reduces the penalty for possession of up to one ounce of marijuana to a 25 civil fine  a trivial sum in his view which he predicted would entice more teenagers to drug use One ounce can be almost 100 joints he said That is not a small amountSociety has some responsibility for protecting minors he added I think the DC law protects them in no way shape or formThe law passed in a 101 council vote in March Supporters cited a study showing a racial disparity in enforcing marijuana laws 90 percent of Washingtonians arrested on charges of possession were black in a city where blacks are 50 percent of the populationMr Harriss effort to block the law came in the form of an amendment to a spending bill which passed the House Appropriations Committee The rider would stop the district from using its tax revenues to enforce decriminalization The measure must survive a full House vote and in an unlikely scenario a joint conference with the Democratcontrolled SenateAttaching budget riders is a backdoor way for lawmakers to block local laws an authority granted to Congress in Article 1 of the Constitution The more straightforward and rarely successful path is a joint resolution of Congress overturning a district law Because Congress has not moved to do that within the required window of 60 legislative days the law is scheduled to take effect this weekIf Mr Harriss rider later becomes law it would make the citys decriminalization a brief interludeDistrict officials while acknowledging the constitutional authority of Congress denounced its interference as undemocraticShouldnt the people of the District of Columbia in a democracy be permitted to make decisions Mr Gray said We have more people in the District of Columbia than in the whole state of Wyoming or in Vermont I cant imagine Representative Harris feels he ought to interfere in the business of those two statesMichael K Fauntroy a political scientist at Howard University who has written extensively on Washington home rule said Congress has not stepped in as often in recent years as during a volatile period in the citys management before 2000But its still a tinderbox and it wouldnt take much to get Congress back involved he saidOne possible spark The citys move to go beyond marijuana decriminalization to full legalization This week activists presented signatures to qualify a referendum for the November ballot that would legalize possession of up to two ounces of pot for personal use and the right to grow three marijuana plants at homePassage of the measure Initiative 71 would put the city in the vanguard of promarijuana jurisdictions including two Western states Colorado and Washington where legal retailers selling recreational marijuana opened this yearThe District of Columbias referendum would not allow sales But the prospect of marijuana plants bending to the sun in the windows of Capitol Hill rowhouses might prove too great a provocation to many lawmakersI think Congress would step in to overturn it Mr Fauntroy said Especially if Republicans take control of the

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/health/politicians-prescriptions-for-marijuana-defy-doctors-and-data.html,New York moved last week to join 22 states in legalizing medical marijuana for patients with a diverse array of debilitating ailments encompassing epilepsy and cancer Crohns disease and Parkinsons Yet there is no rigorous scientific evidence that marijuana effectively treats the symptoms of many of the illnesses for which states have authorized its useInstead experts say lawmakers and the authors of public referendums have acted largely on the basis of animal studies and heartwrenching anecdotes The results have sometimes confounded doctors and researchersThe lists of conditions qualifying patients for marijuana treatment vary considerably from state to state Like most others New Yorks includes cancer HIVAIDS and multiple sclerosis Studies have shown that marijuana can relieve nausea improve appetite and ease painful spasms in those patientsBut New Yorks  list also includes Parkinsons disease Lou Gehrigs disease and epilepsy conditions for which there are no highquality trials indicating marijuana is useful In Illinois more than three dozen conditions qualify for treatment with marijuana including Alzheimers disease lupus Sjogrens syndrome Tourettes syndrome ArnoldChiari malformation and nailpatella syndromeI just dont think the evidence is there for these long lists said Dr Molly Cooke a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco who helped research a position paper on cannabis for the American College of Physicians Its been so hard to study marijuana Policy makers are responding to thin dataEven some advocates of medical marijuana acknowledge that the state laws legalizing it did not result from careful reviews of the medical literatureI wish it were that rational said Mitch Earleywine chairman of the executive board of directors for Norml a national marijuana advocacy group Dr Earleywine said state lawmakers more often ask themselves What disease does the person in a wheelchair in my office haveResearch into marijuanas effects is thin not because of a lack of scientific interest but chiefly because the federal government has long classified it as a Schedule 1 drug with no currently accepted medical use Scientists who want to conduct studies must register with the Drug Enforcement Administration submit an investigational new drug application to the Food and Drug Administration for human trials and win approval from the Department of Health and Human Services or one of the National Institutes of Health The National Institute on Drug Abuse is the only supplier of legal researchgrade marijuanaThe legal and administrative hoops make it hard for investigators to start the randomized placebocontrolled trials that are the gold standard of medical research and the basis for determining which drugs are effective at what doses and in which patientsIts one thing to say we need to have more research and its another thing to obstruct the research said Dr Steven A Jenison former medical director of New Mexicos medical cannabis programThe dearth of data has not prevented legislators and voters across the nation from endorsing marijuana for more than 40 conditions Patients with rheumatoid arthritis for instance qualify for marijuana treatment in at least three statesYet there are no published trials of smoked marijuana in rheumatoid arthritis patients said Dr MaryAnn Fitzcharles a rheumatologist at McGill University who reviewed the evidence of the drugs efficacy in treating rheumatic diseases When we look at herbal cannabis we have zero evidence for efficacy she said Unfortunately this is being driven by regulatory authorities not by sound clinical judgmentNew York considered including the chronic inflammatory disease on its list a development that astonished Dr Mary K Crow an arthritis expert at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan People with rheumatoid arthritis have higher rates of certain respiratory problems she notedInhaling into your lungs is not a great idea with rheumatoid arthritis given the substantial number of patients who have lung disease Dr Crow said The final version of New Yorks law prohibits smoking marijuana and did not end up including rheumatoid arthritisIn Arizona and Rhode Island among other states people with Alzheimers disease may receive medical marijuana to help quell nighttime agitation But Dr Gary Small director of the division of geriatric psychiatry at the University of California Los Angeles said he does not recommend cannabis to Alzheimers patients Agitation and increased confusion are possible side effectsStill he said he would not discourage a caregiver from providing it if it calmed a family member with dementiaParents of children with intractable epilepsy have lobbied hard in several states including New York for inclusion in medical marijuana legislation They want access to an oil called Charlottes Web that is rich in CBD a nonpsychoactive ingredient of marijuana that they say reduces the number of seizuresThis month Gov Rick Scott of Florida a conservative Republican signed a law allowing epilepsy patients access to the oil calling it the best treatment availableScientists have begun randomized placebocontrolled research to determine whether CBD effectively treats severe forms of childhood epilepsy But at the moment highquality research showing that marijuana is a safe or effective treatment for epilepsy does not exist experts sayAs far as data out there there are great animal models and very provoking anecdotes said Dr Orrin Devinsky director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at NYU Langone Medical Center The human data is not there right nowPsoriasis was included in the New York legislation after representatives of Gaia PlantBased Medicine a Colorado company operating dispensaries met with State Senator Diane J Savino and suggested that cannabis lotions helped people with those red raised skin plaques It was dropped from the measure after questions were raised about the lack of supporting evidence  as were other conditions like diabetes and lupusMedical marijuana advocates contend that suffering people should not have to wait for scientific research to catch up to patients needs And why limit marijuana use to only certain conditions they ask when doctors routinely prescribe drugs offlabel for anything they feel likeAmanda Hoffman 35 an information technology specialist in Basking Ridge NJ struggles with ulcerative colitis an inflammatory bowel disease She has tried steroids and Remicade an intravenous infusion but no drug has given her as much relief from frequent daily diarrhea and abdominal pain as her homemade cannabis caramelsOn a recent Sunday Ms Hoffman used a green buttery sludge made with marijuana she bought for 500 an ounce from Garden State Dispensary to make a new batch She is grateful that the state legalized marijuana for patients like her whatever the scientific evidenceCannabis to a lot of people is a punch line but it can also be a lifesaver she saidEven if strong medical research regarding marijuana did exist it is not clear that state lawmakers would be swayedIt would be possible to take case studies or anecdotal information from patients or research done from a university put it in front of a legislator and say We need to include this disease  said State Representative Lou Lang sponsor of the medical marijuana law in IllinoisBut the legislative mind be it in DC or in Springfield Illinois doesnt always go to public policy Mr Lang said The default position is politicsOften state legislators have been motivated not just by constituents in distress but also by the desire to restrict access to limited patient populations so that legal marijuana does not become widely available as a recreational drug in their statesFor example while there is research suggesting that marijuana alleviates certain kinds of chronic pain Mr Lang noted legislators in Illinois were reluctant to legalize its use in such a broad patient population The states list of qualifying conditions is lengthy partly because lawmakers tried instead to specify a number of diagnoses that result in pain some quite rareIll bet there are hundreds of conditions that cause pain and now 30 are listed Karen OKeefe director of state policies at the Marijuana Policy Project said of Illinoiss legislationMedical experts rarely included in these statehouse discussions have often been caught off guard by the sudden passage of laws permitting patients to ask them for marijuanaSince at least 2009 for instance the American Glaucoma Society has said publicly that marijuana is an impractical way to treat glaucoma While it does lower intraocular eye pressure it works only for up to four hours so patients would need to take it even in the middle of the night to achieve consistent reductions in pressure Onceaday eye drops work more predictablyYet glaucoma qualifies for treatment with medical marijuana in more than a dozen states and is included in pending legislation in Ohio and Pennsylvania At one point it appeared in New Yorks legislation tooDr Paul N Orloff the legislative chairman for the New York State Ophthalmological Society reached out to Richard N Gottfried a Manhattan Democrat and sponsor of the Assembly bill and succeeded in getting glaucoma removedIts very illogical to prescribe a medication where its not standardized Dr Orloff said adding None of my 60yearold patients are interested in being stoned to treat their glaucoma,2014-06-27T00:00:00Z,drugs

NYT,http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/assisting-life-and-death/,Saturday was a watershed moment for the American suicideprevention effort In response to decades of public advocacy San Francisco transit authorities unanimously approved a 76 million plan to construct suicide barriers on the Golden Gate Bridge  where 46 people jumped to their death last year alone The time of healing can only begin when the dripdripdrip of bodies into the raging waters has stopped a mother of one jumper toldMichael Cabanatuan of The San Francisco ChronicleSuicide barriers on other bridges have proved to be successful in deterring jumpers Mr Cabanatuan wrote At the Ellington Street Bridge in Washington DC suicides dropped from 25 in seven years to one in the five years after a barrier was erected A span in Switzerland with a net saw suicides drop from 25 per year to noneIts a very emotional day but its very historic said David Campos a San Francisco transportation official to Jennifer Chaussee ofReuters Its a unanimous vote for life todayIn Britain lawmakers are considering the other side of the coin If the government is obligated to protect the physically healthy from selfharm does it have an obligation to assist the terminally ill to die with dignity Is the right to life counterweighted by a right to die According to Paul Lamb and Jane Nicklinson the answer is a resolute yesMr Lamb 57 has spent the past 23 years receiving roundtheclock care following a car crash which left him with only a tiny degree of movement in his right arm reportsJonathan Brown for The Independent Mrs Nicklinsons husband Tony suffered from lockedin syndrome entailing complete paralysis from the neck down following a stroke in 2005The pair originally went to Britains Supreme Court in 2012 The goal to secure the right to die with medical assistance for the severely disabled and to decide how to end this constant tortuous situation which had become daily life as described by Mr Nicklinson in a 2012 statement from his attorneys Current laws forbidding assisted death are barbaric and inhumane says Mr LambThe court rejected the plea claiming that the questions they raised were too significant to be decided upon in a court and could only be answered by parliament according to The Guardians Alexandra ToppingMr Nicklinson passed away six days after the ruling was handed downMrs Nicklinson and Mr Lamb however were undeterred They appealed the decision and on June 24 nearly two years after the initial ruling the court reaffirmed its stance 7 to 2  though the verdict was accompanied by judicial comments that should prove heartening to those engaged in the effort to legalize and destigmatize assisted deathBrenda Hale deputy president of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and one of the dissenting justices said the problem was ensuring that vulnerable people were not put under undue pressures to end their livesaccording to The Irish Times She added that thatproblem was not sufficient to justify a universal ban on assisting suicide It now comes down to legislators to decide whether ailing Britons beyond the possibility of recovery do indeed have a right to die on their own terms The justices of the Supreme Court have given parliament what looks like a final warning writes The Guardians editorial board If they do not amend the 1961 Suicide Act which makes it illegal to help someone to kill themselves then by declaring the existing law incompatible with the Human Rights Act the courts will force them to do soIf members of Parliament vote with the general direction of public opinion in mind it seems likely the efforts of Mrs Nicklinson and Mr Lamb will succeed According to a poll by the Swiss Medical Lawyers Association which surveyed Europeans in 12 countries on the permissibility of medically assisted suicide an overwhelming 82 percent of Britons believe it should be decriminalizedThe objecting 18 percent is nevertheless vociferous Disability isnt a punishment and to consider it as such is an insult to every quadriplegic who has made something of his life writes Kate Maltby for The Telegraph Just because ablebodied people can and do commit suicide  always a terrible thing always cataclysmic to the people around them  doesnt mean disabled people shouldBecause at the heart of this lies our chronic addiction to the language of rights Ms Maltby claims When it comes to the fundamentals of birth death love sex the world has never been able to provide satisfactorily for us How can we claim the right to a life without pain if none of us have ever known one Is the government in breach of contract when it fails to stop my heart breakingIt is a question popping up on legislative and judicial dockets around the world Euthanasia in which a doctor administers the lethal drug is legal onlyin a handful of countries like the Netherlands Belgium and Luxembourg Assisted suicide in which the patient selfadministers is legal in Switzerland Germany Albania Colombia Japan and several American states including Vermont Montana New Mexico Oregon and WashingtonCanadas Supreme Court is considering federal decriminalizationof assisted suicide for the second time  though the province of Quebec has already implemented comprehensive endoflife legislation according to The Globe and Mail Prime Minister Stephen Harpers Conservative government however supports current laws which categorically ban assisted death in any form It is our governments position that the Criminal Code provisions prohibiting assisted suicide and euthanasia are in place to protect all persons said Justice Minister Peter MacKayIn a column published in The Globe and Mail on Friday the Canadian journalist Gary Mason reflected on his own struggle to understand and ultimately embrace the concept of assisted death The last few years of his fathers life were dreadful and without an ounce of joy for the family to endure he recalls but at the same time I wasnt sure I could ever say yes in a sibling vote to end his life regardless of how humane it might be Now I realize how incredibly selfish that point of view wasMr Mason lost his younger brother as well to cancer years later As the younger Mason wasted away on a hospital bed he implored me to steal a needle somewhere and do the job myself Mr Mason jarringly recounts This was certainly not how I wanted to remember my brother It was nothing close to the dignified end most of us hope for In fact his were precisely the circumstances that would qualify for physicianassisted death consideration in more enlightened jurisdictions around the worldAs Canadas baby boomers begin their grand exit he writes the demand for a debate on this subject is only going to intensify A demand that will undoubtedly reverberate around the world,2014-06-29T11:35:50Z,drugs

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/03/sports/amid-triple-crown-chase-a-battle-rages-for-the-soul-of-horse-racing.html,In May 1995 when New York became the last major horse racing center in the United States to legalize the raceday use of Lasix a diuretic that reduces bleeding in horses respiratory systems the decision was celebrated throughout the thoroughbred industry as a great step forwardThe biggest name in the sport the trainer D Wayne Lukas who had won the previous four Triple Crown races with three horses  some on Lasix and some not  hailed it as the beginning of uniform medication rules The breeder Seth Hancock of the prestigious Claiborne Farm in Kentucky spoke for many when he said New York had finally leveled the playing fieldNow as yet another quest for racings elusive Triple Crown culminates Lasix widely regarded as a masking agent for drug abuse is racings last big unresolved medication issue and the center of an internal struggle pitting owners and breeders against trainers and veterinariansCalifornia Chromes Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes victories have been sandwiched between blasts of bad publicityLess than a month before the Derby an undercover investigation by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals focused harshly on the stable of Steve Asmussen one of the sports most successful trainers The group filed charges of neglect mistreatment and drugging of animals with the Kentucky and New York racing authoritiesLast month the HBO program Real Sports essentially repeated a New York Times account of the PETA allegations with graphic video footage of horses breaking down Asmussen fumbled his way through a difficult oncamera crossexamination asserting that he truly cares for horses and that everything he has been accused of is legalA 60 Minutes Sports look at the racing industrys turmoil is scheduled to be presented Wednesday on Showtime three days before the Belmont StakesAfter watching the Real Sports presentation the prominent owner and breeder Bill Casner a founder of WinStar Farm in Kentucky wrote a letter to the Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association which he once headed acknowledging that the reality of the broadcast is that all of it is true and that the industry had created those conditions with a plethora of legal medications with little regulation or oversightThe most volatile and disheartening disclosure of the PETA investigation and the subsequent followup reporting was the routine feeding of ThyroL to horses by wellknown trainers ThyroL is a synthetic hormone in powdered form that is usually prescribed to overweight mares whose hypothyroidism keeps them from becoming pregnantApparently after some state regulators began to crack down on the abuse of the bronchodilator clenbuterol some trainers turned to ThyroL which is now being blamed for a series of fatal heart attacks in young horses There were many heart failures in the barns of the most accomplished and admired trainers in the game including Asmussen Bob Baffert and Todd PletcherUnder the duress of questioning by Real Sports about an equine heart attack victim in his barn Asmussen described ThyroL as a therapeutic medication and the peppedup heart rate as a side effect Over months of daily use Casner said it would cause the thyroid to atrophy with the eventual crash of the horseThyroL and clenbuterol have long lists of side effects which is why they are banned in every racing jurisdiction other than North AmericaThere is little medical research specific to racehorses on either drug an oddity that might be explained by the fact that administering Lasix to 95 percent of all thoroughbreds although only 2 percent to 6 percent bleed excessively is an estimated 100 million revenue stream from owners to veterinarians and drug companies which most equine researchers depend on to finance their studiesStudies show that furosemide the generic name of Lasix causes dangerous electrolyte imbalances particularly reduced levels of potassium and calcium and lowers the count of white blood cells because of bone marrow suppression When given with corticosteroids a common practice the drug damages the joints that fail in training breakdownsIt is hardly coincidental that todays horses seldom last long enough to even contest the Triple Crown The supertrainers start out with dozens of 2yearolds most of them expensive sale toppers but end up with only a few that remain healthy enough for the Kentucky Derby Of the 11 horses expected to compete in the Belmont only two come from the usual Triple Crown barns They are trained by PletcherIn the 1950s American horses averaged 45 career starts For the foal crop of 2009 the average is 124 Those statistics have pushed New York and a group of other MidAtlantic states including Maryland to adopt tougher uniform drug rulesThis years Belmont will permit Lasix but under the same tougher medication rules as the Preakness most of the changes are meant to keep therapeutic drugs that thwart pain and enhance performance from being administered close enough to race time to be effective Previous Triple Crown races in the modern era were contested under three sets of rules Kentucky was among the first states to legalize Lasix and for years Maryland allowed it only for confirmed bleeders depriving Kentucky Derby winners of the advantage they had in LouisvilleRacings drug problems remain a long way from resolution The New York and Kentucky racing authorities postponed action on the PETA charges against Asmussen until after the Belmont It could easily turn out that all that drug abuse of racehorses is legal as Asmussen contends and Casner laments That in itself could serve as a clarion call for a federal law,2014-06-03T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/06/15/us/ap-us-rethinking-pot-child-custody.html,DENVER   A Colorado man loses custody of his children after getting a medical marijuana card The daughter of a Michigan couple growing legal medicinal pot is taken by childprotection authorities after an exhusband says their plants endangered kidsAnd police officers in New Jersey visit a home after a 9yearold mentions his mothers hemp advocacy at schoolWhile the cases were eventually decided in favor of the parents the incidents underscore a growing dilemma While a pot plant in the basement may not bring criminal charges in many states the same plant can become a piece of evidence in child custody or abuse casesThe legal standard is always the best interest of the children and you can imagine how subjective that can get said Jess Cochrane who helped found Bostonbased Family Law  Cannabis Alliance after finding childabuse laws have been slow to catch up with pot policyNo data exist to show how often pot use comes up in custody disputes or how often childwelfare workers intervene in homes where marijuana is usedBut in dozens of interviews with lawyers and officials who work in this area along with activists who counsel parents on marijuana and child endangerment the consensus is clear Pots growing acceptance is complicating the task of determining when kids are in dangerA failed proposal in the Colorado Legislature this year showed the dilemmaColorado considers adult marijuana use legal but pot is still treated like heroin and other Schedule I substances as they are under federal law As a result when it comes to defining a drugendangered child pot cant legally be in a home where children resideTwo Democratic lawmakers tried to update the law by saying that marijuana must also be shown to be a harm or risk to children to constitute abuseBut the effort led to angry opposition from both sides  potusing parents who feared the law could still be used to take their children and marijuanalegalization opponents who argued that pot remains illegal under federal law and that its very presence in a home threatens kidsAfter hours of emotional testimony lawmakers abandoned the effort as too complicated Among the tearyeyed moms at the hearing was Moriah Barnhart who moved to the Denver area from Tampa Florida in search of a cannabisbased treatment for a daughter with brain cancerWe moved here across the country so we wouldnt be criminals But all it takes is one neighbor not approving of what were doing one police officer who doesnt understand and the law says Im a child abuser Barnhart saidSupporters vow to try again to give law enforcement some definitions about when the presence of drugs could harm children even if the kids dont use itThere are people who are very reckless with what theyre doing leaving marijuana brownies on the coffee table or doing hash oil extraction that might blow the place up Too often with law enforcement theyre just looking at the legality of the behavior and not how it is affecting the children said Jim Gerhardt of the Colorado Drug Investigators Association which supported the billColorado courts are wading into the question of when adult pot use endangers kids The state Court of Appeals in 2010 sided with a marijuanausing dad who lost visitation rights though he never used the drug around his daughterThe court reversed a county courts decision that the father couldnt have unsupervised visitation until passing a drug test saying that a parents marijuana use when away from his or her children doesnt suggest any risk of child harmBut childendangerment standards remain murky in Colorado with wide disparities in how local childprotection officers and law enforcement approach pot said Rob Corry a Denver lawyer who successfully argued the fathers custody appealCorry who helped Colorados 2012 campaign to legalize recreational marijuana said the main thrust of the effort was to treat pot like alcoholThink of brewing beer Youve got a constitutional right to do it Theres nothing wrong with it Marijuana should be just as simple  you just keep it on a high shelf right next to your vodka But in practice this is not how law enforcement treats marijuana he saidIn the absence of legal guidelines a growing network of blogs counsel parents in how to deal with police or childprotection agencies concerned about parental marijuana use including one Ladybud run by legalpot activist Diane FornbacherShe said she moved to Colorado this year after childprotection workers visited her family in New Jersey after a teacher alerted officials when her son mentioned hemp  pots nonhallucinogenic cousin  at schoolThey said Were just here to help Emotionally my brain was like My kids My kids My mama bear instinct kicked in she saidThe need for better standards about when marijuana endangers kids is growing by the day said Maria Green a Lansing Michigan mother who lost custody of her infant daughter for three months last yearGreen grows pot to treat her husbands epilepsy and though Michigans medical marijuana law states parents shall not be denied custody or visitation with a child for following the statute a legal dispute with her exhusband led to her daughter being placed with a grandparent until it was resolvedThe exhusband who brought the complaint declined an interview until talking with his lawyerI never in a million years thought that they were going to take my daughter Green said I know that theres a place for child protection but I would love to see it used to protect kids from being actually hurt___,2014-06-15T09:30:58Z,drugs

authorities achieved only partial success in a region where the state holds limited sway and even the militant Shiite group Hezbollah is reluctant to confront formidable local clansSince 2012 the campaign has been quietly shelvedTwo years ago farmers blocked roads when security forces started burning cannabis The government backed down and the interior minister promised to look into compensating farmers for crop eradication and finding them alternative sources of income pledges the farmers say have not been honoredLast year as violence spilled over the border from Syrias civil war  with bombs and gunfights in Lebanons coastal cities and rockets striking towns in the Bekaa  authorities called a halt to a battle they had waged with farmers since the end of Lebanons own 19751990 civil warDuring that war the fertile Bekaa Valley produced up to 1000 tonnes of cannabis resin annually before it was briefly stamped out under a United Nations programme between 19911993From the 1990s until 2012 cannabis eradication took place on an annual basis said Colonel Ghassan Shamseddine head of Lebanons drug enforcement unitBut in 2012it was halted because of the situation on the Lebanese borders and the instability in Syria he said in an interview in BeirutCALLS FOR LEGALIZATIONShamas has grown a variety of crops in his 135 acres 54 hectares of fields including barley wheat onions and potatoes But cannabis provides by far the best returnsIts also a hardy crop well suited to withstand the unusually dry winter which Lebanon suffered this year without the need for expensive irrigationIt costs between 100 and 150 to cultivate one dunum a quarter of an acre or tenth of a hectare much less than a field of wheat At harvest time in late summer farmers can get up to 3000 per dunumWith hashish no one loses says Shamas who has planted more of it as a portion of his overall crop in recent yearsThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ranked Lebanon in 2011 as one of the worlds top five sources of cannabis resin Shamseddine said official figures suggested the total area of cannabis planted has remained constant over the last three years at around 35000 dunums though it has fluctuated sharply in the preceding yearsIn 2005 a tumultuous year when Syrian forces ended their 29year military presence in Lebanon 64000 dunums were planted That fell to 11000 by 2010 the year before Syrias uprising erupted and Lebanon slipped towards domestic turmoilThe long and inconclusive campaign against the cannabis crop combined with recent moves to legalize the drug in two US states has led some prominent Lebanese to add their voices to the farmers calls for cultivation to be legalizedVeteran Druze leader Walid Jumblatt  insisting he had never smoked marijuana  said last month he supported growing cannabis for medicinal use arguing that regulated crop cultivation would improve living conditions in poorer areas of the Bekaa ValleyEconomist Marwan Iskander said fully legalizing the cannabis crop would help Bekaa and another impoverished part of Lebanon the northern Akkar region as well as contributing 400 million to the state budget and 2 billion to the wider economy at a time when Lebanon is struggling with the fallout of Syrias warAt this stage it would have a big impact he said Lebanon needs this farming and needs to revive the Bekaa and Akkar regionsWhile conceding the idea was unlikely to gain widespread support he said he had floated it to senior United Nations and World Bank officials in Beirut They didnt say at the outset that this is going too far he saidREADY TO FIGHTIn practice Shamseddine says that as long as the drug control efforts take second place to containing the spread of Syrias conflict into Lebanon cannabis cultivation will be seen to be officially tolerated at least by the farmersEvery year that passes without eradication encourages people he saidShamas said authorities should take a step further and formally recognize cannabis as a legal crop  a move he said would have benefits for allWe dont like cultivating cannabis by force and making problems he said When the state legalizes it and gives licenses as they do for tobacco cultivation we would abide by that and the state would receive revenues from usRegardless what stance officials take Shamas said he will continue sowing more and moreEvery year weve planted cannabis and every year weve increased the area which weve planted The year they destroyed it we promised them we would plant five times that amountIf they want to legalize it well thank them If we knew that the state was looking after us we wouldnt lift a gun towards a soldier he said But if anyone from the states gangs fights us we will fight backEditing by Peter

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/04/06/us/ap-us-aids-drug-debate.html,NEW YORK   Its the Truvada conundrum A drug hailed as a lifesaver for many people infected by HIV is at the heart of a rancorous debate among gay men AIDS activists and health professionals over its potential for protecting uninfected men who engage in gay sex without using condomsMany doctors and activists see immense promise for such preventive use of Truvada and are campaigning hard to raise awareness of it as a crucial step toward reducing new HIV infections which now total about 50000 a year in the US Recent efforts range from thinktank forums and informational websites to a festive event at a New York City bar featuring popular drag queensYet others  despite mounting evidence of Truvadas effectiveness  say such efforts are reckless tempting some condom users to abandon that layer of protection and exposing them to an array of other sexually transmitted infections aside from HIVIf something comes along thats better than condoms Im all for it but Truvada is not that said Michael Weinstein president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation Lets be honest Its a party drugEven as gayrights organizations celebrate collective progress in the fight to legalize samesex marriage the lesspublicized Truvada debate has fueled bitter divisions within the gay community Some who use the drug say theyve felt shamed by some who dont and theres now a lively backlash by users and their allies including promotion of a Truvada Whore TshirtThe discussion can torch emotions like a flamethrower on a fuel depot wrote Steve Ramos of the Dallas Voice as the gayoriented publication reported on the debate in MarchTruvada produced by Californiabased Gilead Sciences has been around for a decade serving as one of the key drugs used in combination with others as the basic treatment for people who have the AIDScausing virus HIV However the drug took on a more contentious aspect in 2012 when the Food and Drug Administration approved it for preexposure prophylaxis or PrEP  in other words for use to prevent people from getting sexually transmitted HIV in the first placeSince then critics have warned that many gay men wont heed Truvadas onceaday regimen and complained of its high cost  roughly 13000 a year Truvadas proponents say most insurance plans  including Medicaid programs  now cover prescriptions for it and they cite studies showing that the blue pill if taken diligently can reduce the risk of getting HIV by more than 90 percentDr Demetre Daskalakis medical director of the ambulatory HIV program at New Yorks Mount Sinai Hospital served on the FDA panel that recommended approving Truvada for preventive purposes and is among many doctors who hope that doubts about it fadeFor folks who are having a significant amount of unprotected sex its a slam dunk  not only giving them protective medicine but engaging them in testing a whole package of regular health care he saidYet Daskalakis says that out of his large clientele only about 25 men are taking Truvada for preventionTheres some interesting social pushback he said Ive spoken to some of my patients whod totally be candidates but are hesitant to do it They dont want to be labeled as people on the drug because theres a social stigmaDaskalakis is dismayed by groups like the Los Angelesbased AIDS Healthcare Foundation  one of the countrys leading HIVAIDS service providers  which suggest that prescribing Truvada for prevention means condoning condomless sexI find some of that opposition irresponsible Daskalakis said If some men dont want to use condoms they wont You have to deal with it by acknowledging that sometimes unprotected sex happens and you can still prevent HIV infectionsTo date preventive use of Truvada appears to be limited due partly to misgivings among some gay men and partly to lack of awarenessAccording to Gilead 1774 people starting using Truvada for prevention between January 2011 and March 2013  nearly half of them women The company said more recent figures arent available but health officials in several cities said they see no signs of a major surge in usageOut of our thousands of patients we have about 20 on PrEP said Dr Robert Winn medical director at Philadelphias Mazzoni Center which serves many gay clientsMany ask about it few take it Winn said The number one reason for that gap is the commitment of having to take it every dayWeinstein the AIDS Healthcare Foundation leader takes heart from the low usage figures saying they bear out his reservations about Truvada He says hes undeterred by criticism of his insistence that condomless sex  even in the Truvada era  should be discouraged among gay men with multiple partnersTheres an element in the gay community that espouses anything goes that is for sexual freedom and not giving an inch he said But demonizing me or AHF isnt going to shut us upAnother Truvada skeptic is Richard Weinmeyer a research associate with the American Medical Associations Ethics Group In an article in February in Bioethics Forum Weinmeyer  expressing his personal views  argued that preventive use of Truvada could encourage sexual irresponsibilityPersonal responsibility for ones actions has simply been thrown out the window in a community in which we are too often concerned about stigma and moral judgment he wrote We dare not speak against the reckless behavior of others because we wring our hands over the omnipresent worry that we will shame one anotherThe article drew some harsh online criticism readers called it puritanical and fearmongering But Weinmeyer raised a topic thats a visceral part of the debate  the concept of gayongay shaming in which men using Truvada as PrEP are stigmatizedNew York psychotherapist Damon Jacobs an enthusiastic Truvada user since 2011 has encountered the shaming syndrome as he encourages more gay men to learn about the drugs preventive capabilities Since cofounding an informational web site called PrEPoliciousorg Jacobs says hes heard from men distressed by reactions they faced after broaching the possibility of taking TruvadaTheyd email me about the names they were called  the Truvada whore syndrome Jacobs said Theyd talk with their friends about responsible condomless sex and theyd get shamed Theyd get seen as a slutThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers extensive information about PrEP on its web siteStrong research evidence indicates that PrEP when used consistently is safe and effective for reducing the risk of acquiring HIV sexually it saysHowever Jacobs says other wings of the medical establishment should be more active in disseminating that message both to gay men and to doctorsA lot of doctors are still under the belief that if they give their patients PrEP theyll go out and have condomless sex Jacobs said What they dont understand is that gay men are already doing thatAt the Fenway Institute in Boston  which specializes in gay lesbian and transgender health  many doctors initially had misgivings about PrEP but have overcome them according to Dr Kenneth Mayer the institutes medical research directorThere definitely were apprehensions at the beginning  would it increase risktaking behavior would people take it regularly Mayer said More recently the questions are not whether its a good idea but the optimal way to provide it and which patients are the best candidatesI dont have an issue with people voicing concerns about it but we have proof it works said Mayer who hopes highlevel federal officials get more involved in the public discussionAnother challenge is raising awareness of PrEP in black communities with high HIV infection ratesWe have young minority men becoming infected at disproportionately alarming rates and now we have something that could avert this said Lynnette Ford of GMHC a New York City AIDS service organization But theres not a lot of information out there in communities that need it mostDemetre Daskalakis the Mount Sinai doctor said the Truvada debate recalls the way birth control was viewed in some quarters in the 1960s  as an accessory to promiscuityAnyone who takes Truvada someone is looking at them and saying theyre licentious Daskalakis said When this becomes more normalized well be fine____OnlineCDC fact sheet

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/25/business/international/when-cannabis-goes-corporate.html,Hershey stopped producing chocolate in Smiths Falls Ontario six years ago The work went to Mexico but the factory remains along with reminders of the glory days A sign that once directed school buses delivering children for tours A fading themeparkstyle entrance that marks what used to be the big attraction  a Chocolate Shoppe that sold about 4 million of broken candy and bulk bars a yearThe once everpresent sweet smell of chocolate is gone too In the highceilinged warehouse where stacks of Hersheys bars and Reeses Peanut Butter Cups once awaited shipment the nose now picks up a different odor the woody herbal aroma of 50000 marijuana plantsClinical climatecontrolled rooms with artificial sunlight house rows upon rows of plants at various stages of growth In the mother room horticulturalists use cuttings to start new plants The flowering rooms are flooded with intense light 12 hours a day to nurture nearly grown plants in strains with vaguely aristocratic names like Argyle Houndstooth and TwillingThe new owner of this factory at 1 Hershey Drive is Tweed Marijuana It is one of about 20 companies officially licensed to grow medical marijuana in CanadaA court ordered the government to make marijuana available for medicinal purposes in 2000 but the first system for doing so created havoc The government sold directly to approved consumers but individuals were also permitted to grow for their own purposes or to turn over their growing to small operations The freeforall approach prompted a flood of complaints from police and local governmentsSo the Canadian government decided to create an extensive heavily regulated system for growing and selling marijuana The new rules allow users with prescriptions to buy only from one of the approved largescale profitseeking producers like Tweed a move intended to shut down the thousands of informal growing operations scattered across the countryThe requirements which went into effect in April are giving rise to what many are betting will be a lucrative new industry of legitimate producers The government which will collect taxes on the sales estimates that the business could generate more than 31 billion Canadian dollars a year in sales within the next decadeIts just so rare that you have an industry thats growing but which has a huge established market said Chuck Rifici Tweeds chief executive A year ago if you asked me if Id be working while looking at thousands of pot plants I would never have thought that would be the case Before deciding to focus on the marijuana business he worked as a financial consultant to technology startup companies in Ottawa less than an hours drive to the northCanada is not unique in transforming onceforbidden cannabis into a legal or at least tolerated proposition The Netherlands has long allowed personal possession and cultivation of small quantities while allowing commercial sales through licensed cafes Spain permits growing for personal use Portugal has decriminalized possession of small quantities of all drugsIn the United States 20 states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana both Washington State and Colorado have legalized recreational use with conditionsBut marijuana remains illegal under federal law creating uncertainty the federal government for example recently banned statelegal marijuana growers from using federal water on their cropsCanadas acrosstheboard law by contrast provides a cohesive set of regulations laying the groundwork for a group of companies to set up operationsThat was really important for us as investors said Brendan Kennedy chief executive of Privateer Holdings a marijuana private equity fund based in Seattle that started Tilray one of Canadas new legal growers People talk about the Colorado model people talk about the Washington model I think someday theyll talk about the Canada model By creating a tightly regulated federal system by creating a federal license by making it difficult to navigate in and capitalintensive Canada has attracted a different kind of player into this industryWhy Not Smiths FallsFor most of its recent history Smiths Falls population 9000 was defined by two things the 19thcentury canal that passes through its center and the chocolatescented air The Hershey plant which had about 800 employees at its peak was a vital part of the economy Until a recent repainting the towns water tower featured the Hersheys logo and declared Smiths Falls the Chocolate Capital of OntarioIt was a huge tourist attraction for the town Dennis W Staples the towns mayor said of the Hersheys factory which lured about 400000 visitors a year They were without a doubt an excellent corporate citizen The company sponsored sports teams and hockey tournaments and helped underwrite a chocolate and railway festival each summerThe relationship seemed so fixed  the factory had been there for more than 40 years  that Mr Staples was a bit puzzled in February 2007 when reporters called asking for comment on Hersheys plan to leave town No one had told Mr Staples Probably not the best way to communicate to the mayor he saidHershey shut down its conveyor belts in 2008 But that was just the beginning of the bad news for Smiths Falls A year later the province of Ontario closed a nearby home for up to 2650 developmentally disabled adults Stanley Tools an industrial company left as did two other American manufacturers And a portion of the Canadian Pacific Railways old transcontinental line for which Smiths Falls was a regional hub was ripped up In all about 1700 jobs vanished according to Mr StaplesAt first Hershey promised to help the town find a new business to take over the plant A flavoredwater company expressed interest but couldnt get the money together In 2012 Hershey sold the plant to a holding company controlled by the Omnicom Group the adagency giant The new owner inquired about demolition permits last summerAround the same time Mr Rifici who lives in Ottawa showed up in Smiths FallsMr Staples and the town council were supportive They believed that Tweed would help stem even if just a little the outflow of jobs and investmentIf its going to happen somewhere in Canada why not Smiths Falls Mr Staples said Its an opportunity to be part of an industry thats sanctioned by the federal government he said Its going to create 100 jobsThe mayor also had a personal reason When his younger brother was dying from colon cancer 11 years ago marijuana was the only way he found relief from his painDespite the warm welcome Tweed has had to overcome the stigma of a onceillicit business Mr Rifici said the factory owner wouldnt lease the plant to a startup focused on marijuana So Mr Rifici and his business partner Bruce Linton had to form a small investment pool to buy the plant for an undisclosed amountEven once in the building Mr Rifici said it was impossible to get a bank loan to buy equipment Initially Tweed raised money from private investors More recently the company has tapped the public markets for 15 million Canadian dollars by issuing stockOther licensed marijuanagrowing operations have faced similar impediments When Privateer decided to start Tilray for example Mr Kennedy crisscrossed Canada to find the right spot It was apparent he said that Privateer would hit resistance in many areas Illegal growing operations had attracted widespread negative publicity for destroying rental houses with mold and creating fire hazards with their lighting systemsIn Nanaimo British Columbia Mr Kennedy found economic development officials who eagerly courted Tilray The city was looking for new businesses to offset a gradual decline of the forestry and fishing industries the regions historical economic base The officials introduced local zoning bylaws that made it easier for the medical marijuana industry to operateTilray has since bought a building for 35 million and spent 17 million to renovate it The company employs 65 people with plans to increase that number to 100 One hundred new jobs in a community of less than 100000 thats a big deal Mr Kennedy saidStill he said it took a while to find a bank that would deal with a marijuana grower The Royal Bank of Canada eventually agreed to take Tilrays account and to process its credit card transactionsNor has Tweed won over everyone in Smiths Falls Like many small bluecollar towns in rural North America it has an illegaldrug problem mainly crack cocaine and marijuanaDarlene Kantor 50 works as a building manager and she says she is thrilled that Tweed came to town with its jobs and millions of dollars of investment But my main concern is Is it going to make the illegal drugs more rampant she saidSome are more skeptical about whether Tweed will be able to provide many jobs They were talking about creating jobs and such and its not going to its not going to do anything said Andrew Brinkworth 18 outside the downtown Tim Hortons A lot of people here have criminal records and theyre not going to be able to get a job at the plant if they have a recordA 300Page ApplicationDressed in a casual shirt and slacks Mr Rifici 39 is built from an entrepreneurial mold His fast speech and seemingly inexhaustible enthusiasm appear to be byproducts of pitching startup ideas to investors or anyone who will listen for two decadesHis early interest in the Internet came from playing simple textbased games Slaying virtual dragons with someone from Australia from my computer in my parents basement in 199192 was eyeopening to how the Internet would fundamentally alter how we lived he said So I had to get involved in some wayIn 1995 during his third year of computer engineering studies at the University of Ottawa he decided to start an Internet service provider He sold the business in 2003 for 11 million Canadian dollars 1 million to a larger competitor Cybersurf where he became chief financial officer Over the next two decades he helped start a dozen tech companiesHis interest in politics indirectly inspired his marijuana business Mr Rifici who volunteers as chief financial officer of the Liberal Party of Canada one of the three main national parties closely tracked the evolution of marijuana lawsIn October 2012 Health Canada the federal agency responsible for drug controls published a long technical list of proposed reforms One thing caught his eye Under the new approach customers could buy only online or through call centers types of systems that his Internet businesses had operatedBut his background didnt prepare him for the regulatory strictures of the medical marijuana business Accustomed to developing startups on the fly with little capital Mr Rifici and Mr Linton another Ottawa entrepreneur who is Tweeds chairman underestimated the money they would need by a factor of three largely because of the governments regulatory demands The application ran 300 pages not including attachments And before they could even submit applications Tweed and other growers had to secure sites for their operations and obtain all local permissions Applicants who passed the initial vetting then had to pass a final twoday inspectionThe requirements are significant Growers must have sophisticated carbon filtration systems to prevent the smell of marijuana from wafting outside They must maintain highsecurity measures like biometric thumbprint readers Employees need to pass rigorous security checks conducted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police which take four to six monthsIf I knew how much regulatory overhead there would be from the beginning I would have probably been just as excited about the industry Mr Rifici said But I might have thought that I might not be able to get thereNothing like a bit of ignorance to allow you to move aheadThe red tape was part of an effort to reform Canadas initial approach to medical marijuana In court filings the government suggested that the old system had become little more than a legal veneer for recreational growers with a significant amount of marijuana making its way to illegal operations Health Canada said users on average grew enough marijuana to roll 54 to 90 cigarettes a day far beyond what they needed for personal useThere was big big diversion going on Brent Zettl the chief executive of Prairie Plant Systems the company that grew and distributed the governmentsupplied marijuana under the old system The company is now among the newly approved growers They ducked behind legitimate patients and used them he saidTrying to Convince DoctorsWalking the vast 425000squarefoot factory Mr Rifici talks animatedly about Tweeds next steps Just behind the new entrance of glass and shiny stainless steel he has carved out space for a gift shop He also hopes to lure a craft brewer into the unused portion of the factory He wants to make 1 Hershey Drive a destination for tourists againTweed is taking a subdued almost artisanal approach to its branding avoiding the CheechandChong vibe of some rivals Many of its marijuana strains are named after fusty fabrics like tweed as well as people and places associated with such clothes The Herringbone strain is supposed to help with depression Bakerstreet is used to treat anxiety Donegal is promoted as a pain relieverBut the industry faces an uphill battle as prominent doctors researchers and even the Canadian Medical Association are advising against prescribing marijuana at all Marijuana they say has not been through the testing and approval process required for other pharmaceuticalsDr MaryAnn Fitzcharles a rheumatologist and professor of medicine at McGill University in Montreal was the lead author of a widely publicized paper recommending that without clinical evidence marijuana should not be prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis About 65 percent of users in Canada under the old system said they suffered from that condition She compares the medical claims for marijuana to those once made for tobaccoI dont think any physician today would say I suggest you take up smoking cigarettes to deal with your anxiety Dr Fitzcharles saidSo Tilray Prairie Plant and Tweed are creating sales teams to persuade doctors to prescribe marijuana Tweeds chief medical adviser Dr John Gillis an emergencyroom and chronicpain doctor in Dartmouth Nova Scotia is working to develop best practices for prescribing marijuana Christopher Murray who worked with a Canadian agency that evaluates new drugs and medical technology leads a medical education and outreach group for TweedA Fine Legal LineWhen Tweed shipped its first two orders directly to customers on May 5 about half of the companys management watched partly for ceremonial reasons but mostly to make sure that its elaborate governmentmandated inventorytracking system worked Employees weighed the total inventory before doling out the shipments onto smaller scales calibrated to 001 gram The marijuana was dropped into boxes bearing Tweeds logo and then to meet government requirements vacuumpacked into odorblocking bags Then came a final check on the scales before the two parcels left in standard courier pouches that did not bear Tweeds nameAs with many in the new industry Tweed repeatedly cites a Health Canada forecast suggesting that the user base will grow to more than 400000 from about 40000 But some analysts wonder how the industry will reach such levels Mr Zettl is one of the few players who acknowledges that many buyers will probably be recreational users with sham prescriptionsLike most people in the medical marijuana trade Mr Rifici rejected suggestions that the industry was ultimately counting on the introduction of an open legalized market But there is such a possibility Justin Trudeau the leader of the Liberal Party has vowed to legalize marijuana if he takes power in elections scheduled for next year and polls suggest that the idea has widespread supportMr Rifici speaking over the drone of dehumidifiers in the production facility said that the difference between medical marijuana and nonmedical marijuana is one of legislationAnd at the end of the day he added our product is essentially highquality marijuana under a medical

park in a defiant toast to the April 20 pot holiday a onceunderground celebration that stepped into the mainstream in the first state in the nation to legalize recreational marijuanaThe 420 pm smokeout in the shadow of the Colorado capitol was the capstone of an Easter weekend dedicated to cannabis in states across the country Although it is still against the law to publicly smoke marijuana in Colorado police reported only 130 citations or arrests over the course of the twoday event 92 for marijuana consumptionIt feels good not to be persecuted anymore said Joe Garramone exultantly smoking a joint while his 3yearold daughter played on a vast lawn crowded with fellow smokersThe Garramone family came from Hawaii among the tens of thousands who crowded into various cannabisthemed extravaganzas from a marijuana industry expo called the Cannabis Cup at a trade center north of downtown to 420themed concerts at the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater Acts included Slightly Stoopid and Snoop DoggAt 420 pm an enormous plume of marijuana smoke wafted into the sky above downtown Denver as rapper BoB belted out his song Strange Clouds with the hook And all we do is light it up all nightAll you see is strange cloudsStrange clouds strange cloudsThe Civic Center Park event is the most visible sign of the pot holidays transformation It started as a defiant gathering of marijuana activists but this year the event has an official city permit is organized by an events management company and featured booths selling funnel cakes and Greek food next to kiosks hawking hemp lollipops and glass pipesGavin Beldt one of the organizers said in a statement that the event is now a celebration of legal status for its use in Colorado and our launch of an exciting new experience for those attendingDenver is just one of many cities across the country where 420 marijuana celebrations were planned SundayIn Trenton NJ speakers urged a crowd of about 150 gathered at the statehouse to push state and federal lawmakers to legalize or decriminalize marijuana and called on Gov Chris Christie to do what he can to help medical marijuana patients Among those at the rally was Jawara McIntosh the youngest son of noted reggae musician and promarijuana activist Peter ToshIn San Francisco thousands of revelers gathered at Golden Gate Parks Hippie Hill which has become the goto spot for the unsanctioned festival every yearCity officials said they would be cracking down on illegal parking camping drug sales underage drinking and open alcohol containers Hippie Hill was covered in canopies as dozens of people sold potlaced cookies brownies and other items Some vendors told the San Francisco Chronicle that sales were slow because so many people were peddling the treatsOfficer Danielle Newman said at least eight people face possible felony charges but she didnt elaborate on the reasons for their arrestsIn Washington thousands celebrated in the only other state to legalize marijuana Events included one Saturday sponsored by Seattles Dope Magazine with a 99 judges pass available that included 10 marijuana samplesBack in Colorado University of Colorado officials closed the Boulder campus to all but students faculty and staff on Sunday to ensure no 420 celebrations were held Spokesman Ryan Huff said the tactic was working with no arrests reported SundayWhile the weekend was for

recommended dose of a marijuanalaced cookie and jumped to his death from a hotel balcony in Denver State lawmakers are debating how to increase safety regulationsMarijuana festivities got off to a slow start on Easter Sunday But as the clock counted down to 420 and crowds surged into Civic Center Park festivalgoers noted the big changes from previous years  more merchandise and more policeLast years rally was cut short by a shooting that wounded three All attendees this year had to pass through security screening and a heavy police presence ringed the parkI still feel a little like a teenager Garramone said as he eyed police patrolling the parkJust as striking was the proliferation of merchandise from cannabisrelated gear and Tshirts to 9 roast turkey legs and 4 water bottlesI can just imagine how much money is being made right now said Tina Crockett 34 of WichitaThe commercialism disappointed Bob Glisson 27 who was attending his fourth 420 celebration in the parkIts all about the money now the Denver resident complainedStill the scene was wonderfully surreal for Bud Long 49 from Kalamazoo Mich who recalled taking part in his first 420 protest in 1984Nationwide itll be decriminalized he predicted on Saturday the first day of the twoday festival and well be doing this in every state___Associated Press writers Nicholas Riccardi in Denver Terry Chea in San Francisco

courting moderate and establishment Republicans while Ted Cruz keeps up a travel schedule that has 2016 written all over itJeb Bush is stirring from something of a political snooze and a halfdozen other credible prospects are getting their voices heard in the dinAs for Democrats a Hillary Rodham Clinton book coming out in June is about as exciting as it gets these daysThe suspense of a Democratic nomination race is in suspension until the partys dominant figure decides whether to run or someone goes for the prize without waiting for her to make up her mind She sounds and acts a bit more like a candidate by the month which doesnt necessarily mean shell be oneIn both parties potential contenders are best judged by what they do  and where they go like Iowa and New Hampshire  not by what they say Most are keeping up with the fiction that they are not really thinking about running for president even as they transparently position themselves to run for presidentCruz has visited Iowa four times in the past eight months and New Hampshire and South Carolina three times each and claimed thats got nothing to do with presidential campaign politics which no one believes  I think its too early to worry about 2016 the Texas senator said with a straight faceFor months many prospective 2016 presidential candidates have been networking with party leaders donors and activists Theyve published or announced books  Theyre using TV appearances to become household names at least in households tuned to the Sunday or cable news showsWith a few notable exceptions their preparations have accelerated since The Associated Press began broadly tracking their activities last summer  Yet even as most march through a precampaign checklist they are keeping their options open

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/05/11/us/politics/ap-us-2016-presidential-checklist-topics.html,WASHINGTON   In the latest prep work for a presidential campaign Rand Paul is conspicuously courting moderate and establishment Republicans while Ted Cruz keeps up a travel schedule that has 2016 written all over itJeb Bush is stirring from something of a political snooze and a halfdozen other credible prospects are getting their voices heard in the dinAs for Democrats a Hillary Rodham Clinton book coming out in June is about as exciting as it gets these daysThe suspense of a Democratic nomination race is in suspension until the partys dominant figure decides whether to run or someone goes for the prize without waiting for her to make up her mind She sounds and acts a bit more like a candidate by the month which doesnt necessarily mean shell be oneIn both parties potential contenders are best judged by what they do  and where they go like Iowa and New Hampshire  not by what they say Most are keeping up with the fiction that they are not really thinking about running for president even as they transparently position themselves to run for presidentCruz has visited Iowa four times in the past eight months and New Hampshire and South Carolina three times each and claimed thats got nothing to do with presidential campaign politics which no one believes  I think its too early to worry about 2016 the Texas senator said with a straight faceFor months many prospective 2016 presidential candidates have been networking with party leaders donors and activists Theyve published or announced books  Theyre using TV appearances to become household names at least in households tuned to the Sunday or cable news showsWith a few notable exceptions their preparations have accelerated since The Associated Press began broadly tracking their activities last summer  Yet even as most march through a precampaign checklist they are keeping their options open should they decide to sit out the raceAside from Clinton the former secretary of state senator and first lady potential Democratic contenders include Vice President Joe Biden New York Gov Andrew Cuomo

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/05/13/us/politics/ap-us-2016-presidential-checklist-topics.html,WASHINGTON   In the latest prep work for a presidential campaign Rand Paul is conspicuously courting moderate and establishment Republicans while Ted Cruz keeps up a travel schedule that has 2016 written all over it Jeb Bush is stirring from something of a political snooze and a halfdozen other credible prospects are getting their voices heard in the dinAs for Democrats a Hillary Rodham Clinton book coming out in June is about as exciting as it gets these daysThe suspense of a Democratic nomination race is in suspension until the partys dominant figure decides whether to run or someone goes for the prize without waiting for her to make up her mind She sounds and acts a bit more like a candidate by the month which doesnt necessarily mean shell be oneIn both parties potential contenders are best judged by what they do  and where they go like Iowa and New Hampshire  not by what they say Most are keeping up with the fiction that they are not really thinking about running for president even as they transparently position themselves to run for presidentCruz has visited Iowa four times in the past eight months and New Hampshire and South Carolina three times each and claimed thats got nothing to do with presidential campaign politics which no one believes  I think its too early to worry about 2016 the Texas senator said with a straight faceFor months many prospective 2016 presidential candidates have been networking with party leaders donors and activists Theyve published or announced books  Theyre using TV appearances to become household names at least in households tuned to the Sunday or cable news showsWith a few notable exceptions their preparations have accelerated since The Associated Press began broadly tracking their activities last summer  Yet even as most march through a precampaign checklist they are keeping their options open should they decide to sit out the raceAside from Clinton the former secretary of state senator and first lady potential Democratic contenders include Vice President Joe Biden New York Gov Andrew Cuomo

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/05/09/us/politics/ap-us-2016-presidential-checklist-topics.html,WASHINGTON   In the latest prep work for a presidential campaign Rand Paul is conspicuously courting moderate and establishment Republicans while Ted Cruz keeps up a travel schedule that has 2016 written all over itJeb Bush is stirring from something of a political snooze and a halfdozen other credible prospects are getting their voices heard in the dinAs for Democrats a Hillary Rodham Clinton book coming out in June is about as exciting as it gets these daysThe suspense of a Democratic nomination race is in suspension until the partys dominant figure decides whether to run or someone goes for the prize without waiting for her to make up her mind She sounds and acts a bit more like a candidate by the month which doesnt necessarily mean shell be oneIn both parties potential contenders are best judged by what they do  and where they go like Iowa and New Hampshire  not by what they say Most are keeping up with the fiction that they are not really thinking about running for president even as they transparently position themselves to run for presidentCruz has visited Iowa four times in the past eight months and New Hampshire and South Carolina three times each and claimed thats got nothing to do with presidential campaign politics which no one believes  I think its too early to worry about 2016 the Texas senator said with a straight faceFor months many prospective 2016 presidential candidates have been networking with party leaders donors and activists Theyve published or announced books  Theyre using TV appearances to become household names at least in households tuned to the Sunday or cable news showsWith a few notable exceptions their preparations have accelerated since The Associated Press began broadly tracking their activities last summer  Yet even as most march through a precampaign checklist they are keeping their options open should they decide to sit out the raceAside from Clinton the former secretary of state senator and first lady potential Democratic contenders include Vice President Joe Biden New York Gov Andrew Cuomo

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/05/05/us/politics/ap-us-2016-presidential-checklist-topics.html,WASHINGTON   In the latest prep work for a presidential campaign Rand Paul is conspicuously courting moderate and establishment Republicans while Ted Cruz keeps up a travel schedule that has 2016 written all over itJeb Bush is stirring from something of a political snooze and a halfdozen other credible prospects are getting their voices heard in the dinAs for Democrats a Hillary Rodham Clinton book coming out in June is about as exciting as it gets these daysThe suspense of a Democratic nomination race is in suspension until the partys dominant figure decides whether to run or someone goes for the prize without waiting for her to make up her mind She sounds and acts a bit more like a candidate by the month which doesnt necessarily mean shell be oneIn both parties potential contenders are best judged by what they do  and where they go like Iowa and New Hampshire  not by what they say Most are keeping up with the fiction that they are not really thinking about running for president even as they transparently position themselves to run for presidentCruz has visited Iowa four times in the past eight months and New Hampshire and South Carolina three times each and claimed thats got nothing to do with presidential campaign politics which no one believes  I think its too early to worry about 2016 the Texas senator said with a straight faceFor months many prospective 2016 presidential candidates have been networking with party leaders donors and activists Theyve published or announced books  Theyre using TV appearances to become household names at least in households tuned to the Sunday or cable news showsWith a few notable exceptions their preparations have accelerated since The Associated Press began broadly tracking their activities last summer  Yet even as most march through a precampaign checklist they are keeping their options open should they decide to sit out the raceAside from Clinton the former secretary of state senator and first lady potential Democratic contenders include Vice President Joe Biden New York Gov Andrew Cuomo

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/04/02/us/ap-us-drug-policy-poll.html,DENVER   Threefourths of Americans say its inevitable that marijuana will be legal for recreational use across the nation whether they support such policies or not according to a public opinion poll released Wednesday that highlights shifting attitudes following the drug war era and toughoncrime legislationThe Pew Research Center survey also shows increased support for ending mandatory minimum prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenders and doing away altogether with jail time for small amounts of marijuanaThe opinions come as public debate on these topics has led lawmakers around the nation to consider policy changesSince California became the first state to legalize medical marijuana in 1996 at least 19 others and the District of Columbia have followed suit including two that have approved recreational use More than a dozen state legislatures considered legalization measures this yearMeanwhile critics and political leaders both liberal and conservative have clamored for an end to harsh drug sentences saying mandatory minimums have contributed to prison overcrowding civil rights violations and strained budgets US Attorney General Eric Holder has been pushing Congress to overhaul drug sentencing policiesThe telephone survey found that 75 percent of respondents  including majorities of both supporters and opponents of legal marijuana  think that the sale and use of pot eventually will be legal nationwideIt was the first time that question had been asked but it reflects a gradual trend of acceptanceThe survey indicates that four years ago 52 percent of respondents said they thought the use of marijuana should not be legal while 41 percent said it should The new poll shows a reversal with 54 percent in favor of legalization and 42 percent opposed It marked a turning point in a gap that has been shrinking fairly steadily since 1969 the earliest data available when 84 percent said pot should be illegal and only 12 percent thought otherwisePot just doesnt seem as bad said Gregory Carlson a 52yearold landscaper from Denver who did not participate in the Pew surveyYou dont see anything about someone smoking a joint and then driving the wrong way into a school bus Carlson said With a chuckle he added Wednesday They just drive slowerThe survey also highlighted a dramatic shift in attitudes on drug conviction penaltiesThe survey was about evenly divided in 2001 on whether it was good or bad for states to move away from mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders Today poll respondents favored moving away from such policies by a nearly 2to1 margin or 63 percent to 32 percentRespondents said by a margin greater than 3to1 that people who use small amounts of pot shouldnt go to jailEven people who dont favor the legalization of marijuana think the possession of small amounts shouldnt result in jail time said Carroll Doherty Pews Director of Political ResearchThe nation thought differently a generation agoCongress passed the AntiDrug Abuse Act in 1986 to set mandatory minimum sentences for federal drug crimes that could end up in life sentences for repeat offendersYears later many states reported prisons bursting at the seams prompting public officials to start abandoning lock em up drug policies in the 1990s The trend has since acceleratedLast month Holder testified in support of proposed sentence reductions in an effort to reserve the the harshest penalties for the most serious drug offendersSuch plans including one drafted by Kentucky Republican Sen Rand Paul that would give judges wider discretion in sentencing have picked up support from both Republicans and DemocratsThe poll suggested that despite shifting attitudes on legalization the public remains concerned about drug abuse with 32 percent of those surveyed calling it a crisis and 55 percent of respondents viewing it as a serious national problemAnd a narrow majority 54 percent said marijuana legalization would lead to more underage people trying itMarijuana legalization opponents however said the public isnt sold yet on legal potKevin Sabet cofounder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana which opposes pot legalization pointed to the fact that 63 percent said it would bother them if people used marijuana openly in their neighborhoodSaying that we dont want people to serve prison time for marijuana is very different from saying I want a pot shop in my neighborhood selling cookies and candies and putting coupons in the paper Sabet saidThe poll of 1821 adults was conducted Feb 1423 The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 26 percentage points___,2014-04-02T11:01:59Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/us/politics/despite-support-in-party-democratic-governors-resist-legalizing-marijuana.html,LOS ANGELES   California voters strongly favor legalizing marijuana The state Democratic Party adopted a platform last month urging California to follow Colorado and Washington in ending marijuana prohibition The states lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom has called for legalizing the drugBut not Gov Jerry Brown I think we ought to kind of watch and see how things go in Colorado Mr Brown a Democrat said curtly when asked the question as he was presenting his state budget this yearAt a time of rapidly evolving attitudes toward marijuana legalization  a slight majority of Americans now support legalizing the drug  Democratic governors across the country Mr Brown among them find themselves uncomfortably at odds with their own baseEven with Democrats and younger voters leading the wave of the prolegalization shift these governors are standing back supporting much more limited medicalmarijuana proposals or invoking the kind of lawandorder and publichealth arguments more commonly heard from Republicans While 17 more states  most of them leaning Democratic  have seen bills introduced this year to follow Colorado and Washington in approving recreational marijuana no sitting governor or member of the Senate has offered a fullout endorsement of legalization Only Gov Peter Shumlin a Democrat in Vermont which is struggling with a heroin problem said he was open to the ideaQuite frankly I dont think we are ready or want to go down that road Dannel P Malloy the Democratic governor of Connecticut which has legalized medical marijuana and decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana said in an interview Perhaps the best way to handle this is to watch those experiments that are underway I dont think its necessary and I dont think its appropriateThe hesitance expressed by these governors reflects not only governing concerns but also several analysts said a historically rooted political wariness of being portrayed as soft on crime by Republicans In particular Mr Brown who is 75 lived through the culture wars of the 1960s when Democrats suffered from being seen as permissive on issues like thisEither they dont care about it as passionately or they feel embarrassed or vulnerable They fear the judgment said Ethan Nadelmann the founder of the Drug Policy Alliance an organization that favors decriminalization of marijuana The fear of being soft on drugs soft on marijuana soft on crime is woven into the DNA of American politicians especially DemocratsHe described that sentiment as Do not let yourself be outflanked by Republicans when it comes to being tough on crime and tough on drugs You will loseIn Washington and Colorado the Democratic governors had opposed legalization from the start though each made clear that he would follow voters wishes in setting up the first legal recreationalmarijuana marketplaces in the nation If it was up to me being in the middle of it and having read all this research and having some concern Id tell people just to exercise caution Gov John W Hickenlooper of Colorado said in a recent interviewIn Colorado where recreational marijuana went on sale Jan 1 revenue figures released in February suggested that taxes on drug sales could bring in more than 100 million a year for the state a figure that made other states take noteWashington has yet to let its first marijuana stores open  that is expected to happen later this spring  but Gov Jay Inslee has made his position clear As a grandfather I have the same concerns every grandfather has about misuse of any drug including alcohol and marijuana he said in a telephone interview adding All of us want to see our kids make smart decisions and not allow any drug to become injurious in our lifeI recognized the really rational decision that people made that criminalization efforts were not a successful public policy Mr Inslee continued But frankly I really dont want to send a message to our kids that this is a route that is without riskGov Andrew M Cuomo of New York has said he would oppose outright legalization of marijuana but would support legalizing to some extent medical marijuana in the state and might be open to decriminalizing the drugIn New Hampshire Gov Maggie Hassan a Democrat invoked her states struggle with heroin abuse in arguing against weakening marijuana laws Legalizing marijuana wont help us address our substance use challenge she said in her state of the state address this year Experience and data suggests it will do just the oppositeEven in California the first state to legalize medical marijuana and where marijuana advocates are moving to put a legalization initiative on the ballot in 2016 Mr Brown has flashed a yellow lightAll of a sudden if theres advertising and legitimacy how many people can get stoned and still have a great state or a great nation Mr Brown said in an interview on Meet the Press last month The worlds pretty dangerous very competitive I think we need to stay alert if not 24 hours a day more than some of the potheads might be able to put togetherThe resistance comes as public opinion on the issue is moving more rapidly than anyone might have anticipated Nationally 51 percent of adults support legalizing the drug according to a New York TimesCBS News poll conducted in February including 60 percent of Democrats 54 percent of independents and 72 percent of young adults Even 44 percent of Tea Party members said they wanted the drug legalizedIn California 60 percent of likely voters said they supported marijuana legalization in a poll conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California last yearIn many ways the shift in public sentiment toward the legalization of marijuana tracks the rapid change in views on samesex marriage again led by young adults and Democrats But there is one key difference Many elected Democratic officials have come to support samesex marriage and analysts said Democrats could pay a political cost for opposing itVery different than gay marriage Kevin A Sabet an opponent of legalization and a cofounder of Project SAM Smart Approaches to Marijuana said in an email People have strong feelings on gay marriage Its a civilhuman rightsreligious issue for both sides Not so with potThere is no obvious political upside to supporting legalization analysts said and politicians as a rule tend to be risk averse You dont hold these positions without having a sense of your own place in history said former Representative Patrick J Kennedy who joined Mr Sabet in founding Project SAM which strives to reduce marijuana use by emphasizing health risks They can honestly see that this is not a good move that its going to have huge consequences not all of which can be foretoldThat said there is little evidence in most states that a politician would pay a price for supporting legalization said Anna Greenberg a Democratic pollster Weve moved into a frame thats not ideological  she said Its about a system being broken not working and that legalization involves strict regulation that would allow the state to collect revenues That makes a lot of sense to the kind of voters that electeds are most concerned about If thats the way its being discussed it isnt a liability for a politicianAt this point the prospects for other elected officials jumping on the legalization bandwagon is likely to depend on what happens as the experiments in Washington and Colorado proceed Among the questions are whether legalization will lead to more drug abuse by teenagers and how much it will fatten state tax coffersI dont tell other governors what to do Mr Hickenlooper said but when they asked me I said If I was in your shoes I would wait a couple of years and see whether there are unintended consequences from what is admittedly a wellintentioned law,2014-04-06T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/27/us/momentum-is-seen-as-more-states-consider-legalizing-marijuana.html,A little over a year after Colorado and Washington legalized marijuana more than half the states including some in the conservative South are considering decriminalizing the drug or legalizing it for medical or recreational use That has set up a watershed year in the battle over whether marijuana should be as available as alcoholDemonstrating how marijuana is no longer a strictly partisan issue the two states considered likeliest this year to follow Colorado and Washington in outright legalization of the drug are Oregon dominated by liberal Democrats and Alaska where libertarian Republicans hold swayAdvocates of more lenient marijuana laws say they intend to maintain the momentum from their successes heartened by national and statewide polls showing greater public acceptance of legalizing marijuana President Obamas recent musings on the discriminatory effect of marijuana prosecutions and the release of guidelines by his Treasury Department intended to make it easier for banks to do business with legal marijuana businessesTheir opponents though who also see this as a crucial year are just as keen to slow the legalization drives They are aided by a waitandsee attitude among many governors and legislators who seem wary of pushing ahead too quickly without seeing how the rollout of legal marijuana works in Colorado and WashingtonWe feel that if Oregon or Alaska could be stopped it would disrupt the whole narrative these groups have that legalization is inevitable said Kevin A Sabet executive director of Smart Approaches to Marijuana which is spearheading much of the effort to stop these initiatives We could stop that momentumDespite the drug still being illegal under federal law the Obama administration has said it will not interfere with the rollout of legal marijuana in the states for several reasons including whether the state is successful in keeping it out of the hands of minorsAt least 14 states  including Florida where an initiative has already qualified for the ballot  are considering new medical marijuana laws this year according to the Marijuana Policy Project which supports legalization and 12 states and the District of Columbia are contemplating decriminalization in which the drug remains illegal but the penalties are softened or reduced to fines Medical marijuana use is already legal in 20 states and the District of ColumbiaAn even larger number of states at least 17 have seen bills introduced or initiatives begun to legalize the drug for adult use along the lines of alcohol the same approach used in Colorado and Washington but most of those efforts are considered unlikely of success this yearThe allure of tax revenues is also becoming a powerful selling point in some states particularly after Gov John W Hickenlooper of Colorado said last week that taxes from legal marijuana sales would be 134 million in the coming fiscal year much higher than had been predicted when the measure was passed in 2012In Rhode Island which is struggling financially national and local advocates for legalization say the Colorado news is sure to help legislation introduced in February to legalize the drugSome feel its not an appropriate issue for an election year and others want to wait and see what happens in Colorado said State Senator Joshua Miller a Democrat who is sponsoring the Rhode Island legalization law But a lot of other people are very anxious to take the revenue part of this very seriouslyOpponents of legalization meanwhile are mobilizing across the country to slow the momentum keeping a sharp eye on Colorado for any problems in the rollout of the new law thereLegalization almost had to happen in order for people to wake up and realize they dont want it Mr Sabet said In a strange way we feel legalization in a few states could be a blessingCalifornia had been considered a possibility to legalize marijuana this year through a ballot proposition  one to do just that failed in 2010  but the Drug Policy Alliance which had been leading the effort decided this month to wait until 2016While much of the recent attention has focused on these legalization efforts medical marijuana may also cross what its backers consider an important threshold this year  most notably in the South where Alabama Georgia and South Carolina are among the states considering such lawsJohn Morgan an Orlando lawyer whose firm includes former Gov Charlie Crist has spent 36 million of his own money to get a medical marijuana initiative on the November ballot in Florida where a Quinnipiac University poll conducted in November showed that eight in 10 Florida voters support medical marijuana State law requires 60 percent to passMr Morgan insists that his initiative is not intended to help Mr Crist a Republican turned Democrat reclaim the governorshipElection data compiled by Just Say Now a promarijuana group showed that the percentage of the vote that came from people under 30 increased significantly from 2008 to 2012 in states that had marijuana initiatives This youth vote predominantly Democratic rose to 20 percent from 14 percent in Colorado and to 22 percent from 10 percent in Washington both far above the 1 percent rise in the national youth voteIf it benefits Charlie Crist its certainly an unintended consequence Mr Morgan saidMr Sabet said his conversations with Democratic leaders around the country convince him that there is little enthusiasm for being highprofile on the issue For the moment I think by and large Democrats are uncomfortable with that Mr Sabet saidIn Maryland though the marijuana issue is already playing a role in the governors race where all three leading Democratic candidates are talking about how much and how fast to ease marijuana laws not whether to do it at allA narrow majority of Americans  51 percent  believe marijuana should be legal according to a New York TimesCBS News poll conducted last week matching the result in a CBS News poll the previous month In 1979 when The Times and CBS first asked the question only 27 percent wanted cannabis legalizedThere were stark differences in the new poll though While 72 percent of people under 30 favored legalization only 29 percent of those over 65 agreed And while about a third of Republicans now favored legalization this was far below the 60 percent of Democrats and 54 percent of independents who did soIn Alaska sufficient signatures have been collected to get the legalization initiative on the ballotAlaska is a red state but with a heavy libertarian streak said Taylor Bickford spokesman for the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol in Alaska The idea of personal freedom and responsibility is uniting Alaskans on both sides of the aisleUnder state law however the vote will occur during the Aug 19 primary not in the general electionThe support in Alaska is very strong but how do you poll on an issue like this for a lowturnout primary election asked Ethan Nadelmann executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance That is why he thinks Oregon really has the better chance this yearAnthony Johnson the director of New Approach Oregon a coalition that is leading the drive there said advocates are trying to persuade state legislators to put the issue on the November ballot while simultaneously preparing to collect the roughly 88000 signatures that would be needed to force it onto the ballot if the legislators demurAt the moment Id say the odds are no better than 50 percent that the Legislature will act Mr Johnson said But if they dont we will just gather the signatures I am pretty confident we will be able to get themMason Tvert director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project a leading advocate for legalizing marijuana said campaigns were already underway to stage aggressive legalization drives in several states over the next couple of years including Arizona California Maine Massachusetts Nevada and possibly MontanaIt is certainly important to maintain the momentum Mr Tvert said But I dont think we can look at any one election cycle and see what the future holds This is going to be a multiyear effort,2014-02-27T00:00:00Z,drugs
NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/05/02/us/politics/ap-us-2016-presidential-checklist-topics.html,WASHINGTON   In the latest prep work for a presidential campaign Rand Paul is conspicuously courting moderate and establishment Republicans while Ted Cruz keeps up a travel schedule that has 2016 written all over itJeb Bush is stirring from something of a political snooze and a halfdozen other credible prospects are getting their voices heard in the dinAs for Democrats a Hillary Rodham Clinton book coming out in June is about as exciting as it gets these daysThe suspense of a Democratic nomination race is in suspension until the partys dominant figure decides whether to run or someone goes for the prize without waiting for her to make up her mind She sounds and acts a bit more like a candidate by the month which doesnt necessarily mean shell be oneIn both parties potential contenders are best judged by what they do  and where they go like Iowa and New Hampshire  not by what they say Most are keeping up with the fiction that they are not really thinking about running for president even as they transparently position themselves to run for presidentCruz has visited Iowa four times in the past eight months and New Hampshire and South Carolina three times each and claimed thats got nothing to do with presidential campaign politics which no one believes  I think its too early to worry about 2016 the Texas senator said with a straight faceFor months many prospective 2016 presidential candidates have been networking with party leaders donors and activists Theyve published or announced books  Theyre using TV appearances to become household names at least in households tuned to the Sunday or cable news showsWith a few notable exceptions their preparations have accelerated since The Associated Press began broadly tracking their activities last summer  Yet even as most march through a precampaign checklist they are keeping their options open should they decide to sit out the raceAside from Clinton the former secretary of state senator and first lady potential Democratic contenders include Vice President Joe Biden New York Gov Andrew Cuomo

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/03/24/us/24reuters-usa-marijuana-tribe.html,OLYMPIA Washington   A Native American tribe concerned about the impact of marijuana on its youth is fighting to derail the rollout of a nascent recreational pot industry across a quarter of Washington state where it still holds some traditional rightsThe roughly 10000member Yakama Nation had already asserted sovereignty to keep pot outlawed on 12 million acres of reservation land it controls in central Washingtons Yakima ValleyBut in a bold move that could test the limits of tribal sovereignty the Yakama are also seeking to bar pot cultivation and sales from a 108 million acre stretch of the state it ceded under an 1855 treaty with the US government but where the tribe still holds hunting foodgathering and fishing rightsMarijuana is the biggest problem for our people up to age 40 said George Colby attorney for the Yakama Nation Its a bigger problem than alcoholThe move adds to a growing backlash against pot in Washington state that pits the liberal tech hub of Seattle against some more conservative areas At least six local governments are also taking a stand to keep out pot businesses including two that lie on the Yakamas ceded landsMarijuana businesses on those lands spanning 10 counties would exacerbate an epidemic of use in a tribe with no cultural ties to pot Yakama says It has filed challenges to nearly 1300 pending pot business applications thereThe tribe which has threatened to sue if its demands are not met in the past has won legal cases blocking projects deemed detrimental to its wellbeing including a proposed landfill on the ceded lands About a quarter of the land is national forest where pot is already banned by federal lawChris Marr a member of the state Liquor Control Board charged with regulating pot said it would consider the tribes concerns when issuing individual licenses but views the tribes assertion of authority with skepticismAs far as requiring us to deny applications on all ceded lands to me that seems to be quite a heavy lift he saidWashington and Colorado became the first US states to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012 ballot initiatives and a similar measure will be on the ballot in Alaska this summerThe federal government classifies marijuana as an illegal narcotic although the Obama administration issued guidelines in August giving states new leeway to experiment with legalized cannabis Colorado was the first to open a network of statelicensed marijuana stores in JanuaryWashington which issued its first potgrowing license this month is set to follow suit in June Pot regulators have received more than 7000 applications from entrepreneurs seeking licenses to grow process or sell marijuanaCONFRONTATION OR COMPROMISEThe Yakama Nation has cited federal antidrug laws and its desire to curb pot use among its young tribal members in challenging marijuana retail business applications in the ceded lands where over 600000 nonIndians resideA 2011 US National Survey on Drug Use and Health report found 22 percent of Native American youth ages 15 to 17 had used marijuana within the past month nearly double the national averageIf no accommodation is reached the tribe will likely make an unprecedented assertion of tribal authority over the ceded lands by suing in federal court Colby said While it has fought off uses of ceded land it deems objectionable before it has never sought to block a state law from taking hold thereWe are making this the test case Colby saidTroy Eid a former US Attorney for Colorado who chairs a federal advisory panel for criminal justice issues on Native American lands suggested the sides try to reach a settlement rather than heading into a drawnout court caseThey ought to come to some voluntary agreement where each side reserves its arguments about sovereignty and its ability to make law Eid saidThe Yakama Nations demands put it somewhat awkwardly on the same side of the fence as the cities of Yakima and Wenatchee which have enacted their own bans on marijuana retailers and producers over the objections of state regulatorsAlong with other local governments preferring to keep marijuana sales out Yakima and Wenatchee got a boost when the state attorney general issued an opinion in January that cities and counties could opt to ban pot within their own boundariesBut both Yakima and Wenatchee overlap the tribes ceded lands and were wary of appearing to acknowledge any assertions of Indian sovereignty thereWhen they start talking about ceded land theres a lot of other things involved other than marijuana like water rights said Yakima city councilman Bill Lover who opposes pot businessesLeaders of other Native American tribes by contrast have expressed support for the Yakamas bold demands even if no other tribes appear poised to followed suitIts a steep hill theyre trying to climb said Ron Allen chairman of the Jamestown SKlallam Tribe in western Washington which is among a majority of US tribes on whose reservations pot use remains banned But I recognize their right to try to control

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/health/driving-under-the-influence-of-marijuana.html,If you are pulled over on suspicion of drunken driving the police officer is likely to ask you to complete three tasks Follow a pen with your eyes while the officer moves it back and forth get out of the car and walk nine steps heel to toe turn on one foot and go back and stand on one leg for 30 secondsScore well on all three of these Olympic events and theres a very good chance that you are not drunk This socalled standard field sobriety test has been shown to catch 88 percent of drivers under the influence of alcoholBut it is nowhere near as good at spotting a stoned driverIn a 2012 study published in the journal Psychopharmacology only 30 percent of people under the influence of THC the active ingredient in marijuana failed the field test And its ability to identify a stoned driver seems to depend heavily on whether the driver is accustomed to being stonedA 21yearold on his first bender and a hardened alcoholic will both wobble on one foot But the same is not necessarily true of a driver who just smoked his first joint and the stoner who is high five days a week In another study 50 percent of the less frequent smokers failed the field testAs more states legalize medical and recreational marijuana distinctions like these will grow more and more important But sciences answers to crucial questions about driving while stoned  how dangerous it is how to test for impairment and how the risks compare to driving drunk  have been slow to reach the general publicOur goal is to put out the science and have it used for evidencebased drug policy said Marilyn A Huestis a senior investigator at the National Institute on Drug Abuse But I think its a mishmashA 2007 study found that 12 percent of the drivers randomly stopped on American highways on Friday and Saturday nights had been drinking In return for taking part in the study intoxicated drivers were told they would not be arrested just taken homeSix percent of the drivers tested positive for marijuana  a number that is likely to go up with increased availability Some experts and officials are concerned that the campaign against drunken driving has not gotten through to marijuana smokersWeve done phone surveys and were hearing that a lot of people think DUI laws dont apply to marijuana said Glenn Davis highway safety manager at the Department of Transportation in Colorado where recreational marijuana use became legal on Jan 1 And theres always somebody who says I drive better while highEvidence suggests that is not the case But it also suggests that we may not have as much to fear from stoned driving as from drunken driving Some researchers say that limited resources are better applied to continuing to reduce drunken driving Stoned driving they say is simply less dangerousStill it is clear that marijuana use causes deficits that affect driving ability Dr Huestis said She noted that several researchers working independently of one another have come up with the same estimate a twofold increase in the risk of an accident if there is any measurable amount of THC in the bloodstreamThe estimate is based on review papers that considered the results of many individual studies The results were often contradictory  some of the papers showed no increase in risk or even a decrease  but the twofold estimate is widely acceptedThe estimate is low however compared with the dangers of drunken driving A recent study of federal crash data found that 20yearold drivers with a bloodalcohol content of 008 percent  the legal limit for driving  had an almost 20fold increase in the risk of a fatal accident compared with sober drivers For older adults up to age 34 the increase was ninefoldThe studys lead author Eduardo Romano a senior research scientist at the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation said that once he adjusted for demographics and the presence of alcohol marijuana did not statistically increase the risk of a crashDespite our results I still think that marijuana contributes to crash risk he said only that its contribution is not as important as it was expectedThe difference in risk between marijuana and alcohol can probably be explained by two things Dr Huestis and Dr Romano both say First stoned drivers drive differently from drunken ones and they have different deficits Drunken drivers tend to drive faster than normal and to overestimate their skills studies have shown the opposite is true for stoned driversThe joke with that is Cheech and Chong being arrested for doing 20 on the freeway said Mark A R Kleiman a professor of public policy at the UCLA School of Public AffairsDr Huestis also found that in laboratory studies most people who were high could pass simple tests of memory addition and subtraction though they had to use more brainpower than sober people who passed the same tests People who were drunk were much more likely to failThe deficits of being stoned really began to show up she said when people had to handle multiple tasks at once and were confronted with something unexpectedIts typical to see a young adolescent with three or four other kids in the car she said of stoned driving Hes aware he might be impaired so hes driving carefullyBut then he sees an old man in the middle of the street All his senses say This guy is there but will be out of way by the time I get there But then the old man drops his keys and hes slower than the kid expected By the time it takes to process a change in the situation theres an accidentAnother factor is location A lot of drinking is done in bars and clubs away from home with patrons driving to get there and then leaving by car By contrast marijuana smokers tend to get high at homeThere is a lot of debate about how best to prove that drivers under the influence of THC are too intoxicated to drive Bloodalcohol content can be reliably tested on the side of the road with a Breathalyzer and ample data link rising levels of blood alcohol to decreases in driving skills The same is not true for marijuanaTHC levels must be measured from blood or urine samples which are typically taken hours after an arrest Urine tests which look for a metabolite of THC rather than the drug itself return a positive result days or weeks after someone has actually smoked Yet most states have laws that equate any detectable level of THC metabolite in urine with detectable levels of actual THC in blood and criminalize both Only six states have set legal limits for THC concentration in the blood In Colorado and Washington where recreational use has been legalized that limit is five nanograms per milliliter of blood or five parts per billionThe problem Dr Huestis said was that studies from Europe suggested that this limit was far too high Ninety percent of impaireddriving cases in Sweden would be missed at that level she saidThe studies indicated that a better limit would be just one nanogram per milliliter she said But because THC builds up in fatty tissue and is released slowly over time such a limit would ensnare frequent users who may not actually be high Indeed if you smoke often enough your bloodTHC content might still be five nanograms per milliliter a day after you last lit upAll of these facts lead experts like Dr Romano and Dr Kleiman to believe that public resources are better spent combating drunken driving Stoned driving they say is best dealt with by discouraging people from mixing marijuana and alcohol  a combination that is even riskier than alcohol alone  and by policies that minimize marijuanas risk on the roadFor instance states that legalize recreational marijuana Dr Kleiman said should ban establishments like pot bars that encourage people to smoke away from home And Dr Romano said that lowering the legal bloodalcohol concentration or BAC to 005 or even 002 percent would reduce risk far more effectively than any effort to curb stoned drivingIm not saying marijuana is safe he said But to me its clear that lowering the BAC should be our top priority That policy would save more

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/02/15/us/ap-us-rethinking-pot-going-global-3rd-ld-writethru.html,In a former colonial mansion in Jamaica politicians huddle to discuss trying to ease marijuana laws in the land of the late reggae musician and cannabis evangelist Bob Marley In Morocco one of the worlds top producers of the concentrated pot known as hashish two leading political parties want to legalize its cultivation at least for medical and industrial useAnd in Mexico City the vast metropolis of a country ravaged by horrific cartel bloodshed lawmakers have proposed a brand new plan to let stores sell the drugFrom the Americas to Europe to North Africa and beyond the marijuana legalization movement is gaining unprecedented traction  a nod to successful efforts in Colorado Washington state and the small South American nation of Uruguay which in December became the first country to approve nationwide pot legalizationLeaders long weary of the drug wars violence and futility have been emboldened by changes in US policy even in the face of opposition from their own conservative populations Some are eager to try an approach that focuses on public health instead of prohibition and some see a potentially lucrative industry in cannabis regulationA number of countries are saying Weve been curious about this but we didnt think we could go this route said Sam Kamin a University of Denver law professor who helped write Colorados marijuana regulations Its harder for the US to look at other countries and say You cant legalize you cant decriminalize because its going on hereThats due largely to a White House thats more open to drug war alternativesUS President Barack Obama recently told The New Yorker magazine that he considers marijuana less dangerous to consumers than alcohol and said its important that the legalization experiments in Washington and Colorado go forward especially because blacks are arrested for the drug at a greater rate than whites despite similar levels of useHis administration also has criticized drug wardriven incarceration rates in the US and announced that it will let banks do business with licensed marijuana operations which have largely been cashonly because federal law forbids financial institutions from processing potrelated transactionsSuch actions underscore how the official US position has changed in recent years In 2009 the US Department of Justice announced it wouldnt target medical marijuana patients In August the agency said it wouldnt interfere with the laws in Colorado and Washington which regulate the growth and sale of taxed pot for recreational useGovernment officials and activists worldwide have taken note of the more open stance Also not lost on them was the Obama administrations public silence before votes in both states and in UruguayIt all creates a sense that the US is no longer quite the drug warobsessed government it was and that other nations have some political space to explore reform said Ethan Nadelmann head of the nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance a prolegalization group based in New YorkAnxiety over US reprisals has previously doused reform efforts in Jamaica including a 2001 attempt to approve private use of marijuana by adults Given Americas evolution the discussion has changed said Delano Seiveright director of Ganja Law Reform CoalitionJamaicaLast summer eight lawmakers evenly split between the ruling Peoples National Party and the opposition Jamaica Labor Party met with Nadelmann and local cannabis crusaders at a luxury hotel in Kingstons financial district and discussed next steps including a nearterm effort to decriminalize pot possessionOfficials are concerned about the roughly 300 young men each week who get criminal records for possessing small amounts of ganja Others in the debtshackled nation worry about losing out on tourism dollars For many weed is synonymous with Marleys home country where it has long been used as a medicinal herb by families including as a cold remedy and as a spiritual sacrament by RastafariansInfluential politicians are increasingly taking up the idea of loosening pot restrictions Jamaicas health minister recently said he was fully on board with medical marijuanaThe cooperation on this issue far outweighs what Ive seen before Seiveright said Both sides are in agreement with the need to move forwardIn Morocco lawmakers have been inspired by the experiments in Washington Colorado and Uruguay to push forward their longstanding desire to allow cannabis to be grown for medical and industrial uses They say such a law would help small farmers who survive on the crop but live at the mercy of drug lords and police attempts to eradicate itSecurity policies arent solving the problem because its an economic and social issue said Mehdi Bensaid a legislator with the Party of Authenticity and Modernity a political party closely allied with the countrys king We think this crop can become an important economic resource for Morocco and the citizens of this regionIn October lawmakers from Uruguay Mexico and Canada converged on Colorado for a firsthand look at how that states law is being implemented They toured a medical marijuana dispensary and sniffed barcoded marijuana plants as the dispensarys owner gave them a tourMexico has outlets like that but guarded by armed men Mexican Congressman Ren Fujiwara Montelongo said afterwardTheres no general push to legalize marijuana in Mexico where tens of thousands have died in cartel violence in recent years But in liberal Mexico City legislators on Thursday introduced a measure to let stores sell up to 5 grams of pot Its supported by the mayor but could set up a fight with the conservative federal governmentRather than continue fighting a war that makes no sense now we are joining a cuttingedge process said Jorge Castaneda a former Mexican foreign ministerOpponents to legalization worry that pot could become heavily commercialized or that increased access will increase youth use They say the other sides political victories have reawakened their causeTheres been a real hunger from people abroad to find out how we got ourselves into this mess in the first place and how to avoid it said Kevin Sabet of Project Smart Approaches to MarijuanaWashington and Colorado passed recreational laws in 2012 to regulate the growth and sale of taxed pot at statelicensed stores Sales began Jan 1 in Colorado and are due to start later this year in Washington Twenty states and the District of Columbia already have medical marijuana lawsA number of US states are considering whether to try for recreational laws Voters in Alaska will have their say on a legalization measure this summer Oregon voters could also weigh in this year and in California drugreform groups are deciding whether to push a ballot measure in 2014 or wait until 2016s presidential election Abroad activists are pushing the issue before a United Nations summit in 2016While some European countries including Spain Belgium and the Czech Republic have taken steps over the years to liberalize pot laws in the face of international treaties that limit drug production to medical and research purposes the Netherlands famous for its pot coffee shops has started to pull back calling on cities to close shops near schools and ban sales to touristsThere is however an effort afoot to legitimize the growing of cannabis sold in the coffee shops While its been legal to sell pot its not to grow it so shops must turn to the black market for their supply which may wind up seized in a raidIn Latin America and the Caribbean where some countries have decriminalized possession of small amounts of drugs from cocaine to marijuana there is significant public opposition to further legalization But top officials are realizing that it is nevertheless on the table despite the longstanding efforts of the US which has provided billions of dollars to support counternarcotics work in the hemisphereCurrent or former presidents in Colombia Mexico Guatemala and Brazil have called for a reevaluation of or end to the drug war a chorus echoed by Argentinas drug czar Juan Carlos Molina a Roman Catholic priest who has long served in the nations drugwasted slumsMolina said hes following orders from President Cristina Fernandez to change the governments focus from enforcing drug laws against young people to getting them into treatment He also said after Fernandez appointed him in December that Argentine society is ready to openly debate legalizing marijuana altogetherI believe that Argentina deserves a good debate about this We have the capacity to do it The issue is fundamental for this country Molina said in an interview with Radio del PlataThe pace of change has put American legalization activists in heavy demand at conferences in countries weighing their drug laws including Chile Poland and the Netherlands The advocates including those who worked on the efforts in Washington and Colorado have advised foreign lawmakers and activists on how to build campaignsClara Musto a spokeswoman for the Uruguayan campaign said meeting with the Americans helped her

introduced or initiatives begun to legalize the drug for adult use along the lines of alcohol the same approach used in Colorado and Washington but most of those efforts are considered unlikely of success this yearIn the first sentence the object of the preposition despite is the gerund being so in careful usage we would need the possessive drugs  despite the drugs still being illegal But

Mitt Romney in 2012 and Democrats have leaned heavily on issues like reproductive rights and equal pay to help turn out and energize their baseWe should be cautious with the phrase reproductive rights

Uruguay have prompted or accelerated discussion about changing pot laws in many nations and activists say momentum is building in advance of a special United Nations convention on drugs scheduled for 2016 Heres a look at how some countries are rethinking their approach to marijuana___ARGENTINAPersonal possession of controlled substances has been decriminalized thanks to a Supreme Court ruling in 2009 that found imposing jail time for small amounts of drugs was a violation of Argentinas constitution which protects private actions that dont harm others Lawmakers have been working to amend the law since then with proposals ranging from simple decriminalization in accordance with the ruling to a complete overhaul of the countrys drug laws In December Father Juan Carlos Molina a Catholic priest newly appointed as the nations drug czar said Argentina deserves a debate about whether to follow Uruguay in regulating marijuana___BRAZILBrazil doesnt punish personal drug use but trafficking or transporting small amounts of controlled substances is a criminal offense punishable by drug abuse education or community service Some advocates worry the law isnt clear about how much constitutes personal possession and that can leave it up to a judges discretion about whether someone should be punished In November former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso joined former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in calling for the decriminalization of all drugs and allowing countries to experiment with drug regulation___GUATEMALAPresident Otto Perez Molina of Guatemala a hardhit cocaine transit country took the floor at the UN last fall to join a growing chorus of nations calling the drug war a failed strategy He announced that his country would study different approaches and praised the visionary experiments in Washington and Colorado  as well as US President Barack Obamas decision to let them go forward Currently prison terms of four months to two years can be imposed for the possession of drugs for personal use___JAMAICAThe island nation is a primary source of marijuana in the Caribbean Possession remains illegal and can result in mandated treatment or rehabilitation though usually the defendant pays a small fine and is not incarcerated Nevertheless many young men wind up with criminal records that affect their future employment options and recent changes in the US and Uruguay have given momentum to activists who hope to see marijuana decriminalization approved soon___MEXICOIn Mexico where tens of thousands have been killed in drug war violence in the past seven years there is no general push to legalize or regulate marijuana for recreational use But in more liberal Mexico City a metropolis of 8 million lawmakers have introduced a measure to allow stores to sell up to 5 grams of pot The plan has the mayors support but could set up a fight with the federal government Small amounts of marijuana and other drugs have been decriminalized in Mexico since 2009___MOROCCOMorocco is one of the worlds leading hashish producers and nearly all of it makes its way into Europe Cannabis was legal to grow as late as the 1950s by order of the king Two leading political parties want to relegalize its cultivation for medical and industrial uses with the goal of helping small farmers who survive on the crop but live at the mercy of drug lords and police attempts to eradicate it There is little chance the conservative nation will legalize it for recreational use any time soon___NETHERLANDSThe Netherlands has long had some of the most liberal cannabis laws Hoping to keep pot users away from dealers of harder drugs the country in the late 1970s began allowing coffee shops to sell marijuana which remains technically illegal Since 2012 the federal government has clamped down briefly requiring people to obtain a weed pass to buy cannabis and banning sales to tourists Some cities including Amsterdam have declined to ban sales to tourists however and mayors of 35 cities have banded together to call for the legalization of marijuana growing___UNITED STATESLong the drug war crusader the US was the driving force behind the 1961 treaty that formed the basis of international narcotics control For decades the US has required other nations to cooperate in the drug war or risk losing foreign aid even as some Latin American countries ravaged by drug war violence criticized America for failing to curb its appetite for cocaine marijuana and other substances Since 1996 nearly half the states have allowed medical use of marijuana despite federal laws banning it and some states are considering following the lead of Washington state and Colorado in legalizing recreational use___URUGUAYIn December Uruguay became the first nation to approve marijuana legalization and regulation President Jose Mujica said his goal is to drive drug traffickers out of the dope business and reduce consumption by creating a safe legal and transparent environment in which the state closely monitors every aspect of marijuana use By April Uruguay is expected to have written the fine print on its regulations Once registered and licensed

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/us/us-issues-marijuana-guidelines-for-banks.html,The Obama administration on Friday issued guidelines intended to give banks confidence that they will not be punished if they provide services to legitimate marijuana businesses in states that have legalized the medical or recreational use of the drug even though it remains illicit under federal lawThe guidance which requires banks to vigorously monitor their marijuanaindustry customers was provided by the Treasury Department and the Justice Department in separate advisories The policy does not grant immunity from prosecution or civil penalties to banks that serve legal marijuana businesses But it directs prosecutors and regulators to give priority to cases only where financial institutions have failed to adhere to the guidanceStill the banking industry was quick to say that the new guidelines would not be sufficient to make banks feel at ease about opening accounts for or granting loans to marijuana businesses because the drug would still be illegal under the federal Controlled Substances ActWhile we appreciate the efforts by the Department of Justice and FinCEN guidance or regulation doesnt alter the underlying challenge for banks Frank Keating president of the American Bankers Association said in a statement referring to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network the Treasury unit that issued part of the guidelines As it stands possession or distribution of marijuana violates federal law and banks that provide support for those activities face the risk of prosecution and assorted sanctionsTwenty states and the District of Columbia allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes and two of those states Colorado and Washington have also legalized the recreational use of the drug Those numbers may grow this year as several other states are considering measures to legalize marijuana useIn a threepage memo to prosecutors issued in conjunction with the new banking guidelines Deputy Attorney General James M Cole wrote that prosecutions may not be appropriate when banks do business with marijuana entities that are operating legally under state law and do not violate any of the eight priorities set forth in a Justice Department memo last August Those priorities include preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors and preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprisesJennifer Shasky Calvery director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network said she was unaware of any banks that have been punished for servicing legal marijuana businessesLegal marijuana entrepreneurs have stressed that access to banking has been their most pressing concern Their businesses are conducted almost entirely in cash raising huge security concerns because it is difficult for them to open and maintain bank accounts or to accept credit cards Banks have been apprehensive about providing services to marijuana businesses for fear that the authorities might punish them for violating moneylaundering laws among other federal statutes and regulationsLast month Attorney General Eric H Holder Jr acknowledged that having so much cash on hand presented a public safety problem for legal marijuana businesses adding that they should have access to the countrys banking systemSome representatives of the legal marijuana industry said that although the guidelines showed progress federal laws need to be revampedIts a great step in the right direction but ultimately it would not solve all the problems here said Michael Elliott executive director of the Medical Marijuana Industry Group in Colorado We need to go beyond saying that this is a low law enforcement priority There are still violations of federal law going on here So federal laws need to be changed to ensure that what is legal in states like Colorado is legal at the federal level as wellMarijuana remains a Schedule 1 drug  along with heroin LSD and Ecstasy  under the Controlled Substances Act This week 18 members of Congress in a joint letter to President Obama asked him to instruct Mr Holder to remove marijuana from any of the drug schedules or to reschedule it to a lower categoryClassifying marijuana as Schedule 1 at the federal level perpetuates an unjust and irrational system the lawmakers led by Representative Earl Blumenauer Democrat of Oregon said in the letter Schedule 1 recognizes no medical use disregarding both medical evidence and the laws of nearly half of the states that have legalized medical marijuanaMs Shasky Calvery said in a conference call with reporters that the guidelines should clarify how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana businesses while maintaining their obligation to comply with the federal antimoneylaundering law the Bank Secrecy Act She also said that the guidelines were drafted to move from the shadows the financial operations of marijuana businessesThe guidance will provide transparency and mitigate the risks to the financial system Ms Shasky Calvery said The authorities do not intend to crack down on banks for a technical mishap she said adding We are not looking to have a gotcha enforcement regimeIn a sevenpage document explaining the guidelines FinCEN called for due diligence by financial institutions in monitoring their marijuana customers including reviewing their applications for state licenses and understanding their normal and expected activity such as the types of products they sell and whether they have medical or recreational customersSince the financial transactions of a marijuana business are considered illegal under federal law banks are required to file suspicious activity reports on those entities A spokesman for the Treasury unit Steve Hudak said the reports under the guidelines would be abbreviated versions Banks will have to initially file one suspicious activity report on a marijuana business

reach into the refrigerator and pull out tasty ways to get high They buy sparkling peach and mandarin elixirs watermelon Dew Drops and sleek silver bags of chocolate truffles each one packed with marijuanas potent punchThe stuff just flies off the shelves said Linda Andrews the stores ownerAs marijuana tiptoes further toward the legal mainstream marijuanainfused snacks have become a booming business with varieties ranging from chocolatepeppermint Mile High Bars to peanut butter candies infused with hash oilRetail shops see them as a nonthreatening way into the shallow end of the marijuana pool ideal for older customers tourists staying in smokefree hotels or anyone who wants the effect without the smoke and coughingBut the popularity of edible marijuana has alarmed parents groups schools and some doctors who say the highly concentrated snacks are increasingly landing in the hands of teenagers looking for a sweet discreet high or of children too young to know the difference between pot brownies and regular onesColorado like the other states with medical or recreational marijuana has tried to keep the products away from children It has ordered stores to sell them in childresistant packages and bars labels designed to appeal to children It requires manufacturers to list ingredients serving sizes and expiration datesBut critics say the regulations are not strict enough especially for products that can contain 10 times as much psychoactive THC as the marijuana a casual user might take Because prices often depend on the amount of THC one highly potent caramel chew can sell for 20 while a package of 10 less concentrated candies might be the same price And like flavored cigarettes or wine coolers critics say edible marijuana offers a dangerously easy onramp for younger usersTheyre attractive to kids theyre easily disguised said Gina Carbone of Smart Colorado a group that opposes legalization Theyre not being regulated properly at all to protect kidsOne survey has found a small but growing number of children seeking treatment after accidentally consuming marijuana Fourteen such children visited the emergency department of Childrens Hospital Colorado in the Denver area from October 2009 through December 2011 researchers reported last year in the journal JAMA Pediatrics Before 2009 researchers reported no marijuana exposuresThe research took place after an explosion of medicalmarijuana shops in Colorado but before voters passed measures to legalize the sales and use of recreational marijuana to adults 21 and older Dr George Sam Wang an author of the study and a clinical instructor in pediatrics at Childrens Hospital said he had not seen any additional increases in childrens marijuana exposure since recreational sales began the first of this yearThe children many of them toddlers were taken in because they seemed strangely sleepy and disoriented One had trouble breathing About half had eaten marijuana cookies cakes or candies forms that researchers believed made them more enticingThose edible products are inherently more attractive than what a bud would look like Dr Wang saidIn the Northern Colorado city of Longmont 2yearold Evelyn Hernandez was playing in the front yard outside her familys apartment building early in January when she spotted what looked like a chocolatechip cookie in the grass her mother Aida later told the police The girl took a few bites before Ms Hernandez noticed and threw away the cookieA halfhour later while the family was grocery shopping Ms Hernandez noticed that Evelyn was drowsy and drooping and struggling to walk When she took her to the hospital the girl tested positive for THC according to a police reportShes fine now Ms Hernandez said in a brief interview while Evelyn grinning waved and made faces from the livingroom couchOn the other side of the state in a farm town renowned for its sweet corn a student from Olathe High School ended up in the emergency room after a 14yearold classmate passed some marijuanainfused brownies around the school last week Justin Harlan the Olathe police chief said the brownies appeared to have been homemade not sold from a dispensary He said his officers were still investigating how the student had gotten the brownies and whether to file felony criminal chargesIn a letter to parents the schools principal Scot Brown warned that there would be serious consequences for students who brought marijuana onto campus But with recreational marijuana now legal in Colorado school officials were bracing for more Marijuana

the first to legalize the drug for recreational use Sales in Colorado began on Jan 1 and have gone smoothly so far regulators say Retail sales in Washington are expected to start this springMarijuana even if consumed by children in high doses poses few of the grave dangers of overdosing on alcohol or drinking household chemicals But doctors said young children who consume marijuana are at risk of falling and hurting themselves or falling asleep in a position where they could not breathe For the most part doctors who treated children in the study advised that the children be watched closely as their bodies digested the drugTheres no antidote no medicine that reverses this Dr Wang saidCompared with the 14 children who were treated after consuming marijuana the hospital treated 48 children who had swallowed acetaminophen  the active ingredient in Tylenol  and 32 who had accidentally taken antihistamines during the same time periodRegulators manufacturers and retailers say they are working intensely to keep marijuana  edible or not  safe and tightly regulated If they fail federal authorities have warned they could step in and take actionSo far the state has given licenses to 34 retail marijuana product manufacturers who extract THCrich oil from marijuana plants to make everything from lip balm and lotion to chocolate candiesTripp Keber the managing partner of Dixie Elixirs

activate It sells its wares in silver bags and opaque silver bottles No cartoon characters allowedHaving pink flamingos and grape apes on products is not appropriate Mr Keber saidThe company distributes its products to about 490 medical and retail dispensaries across the state and hopes to expand to Arizona and California Mr Keber wants to reach 23yearold ski lift operators and 73yearold

decidedly political side effectThe ballot proposal which was approved by Floridas Supreme Court on Monday is so popular it could help Democrats unseat the states Republican Governor Rick Scott who is up for reelection in NovemberDemocrats believe it could energize their base in a midterm electoral season that generally results in low turn out while polls show even a majority of Florida Republicans support medical marijuana useScott opposes the ballot initiative and is trailing in polls to his main challenger former governor Charlie Crist who favors legalization That could set the stage for a political battle in a state that is both a harsh enforcer of drug laws and a major pot producerFloridas contest is the only gubernatorial election in a big swing state in Novembers midterm elections and a Democratic victory would be a major blow to the Republican party heading into the 2016 presidential raceScott tried to block the ballot arguing the wording was too vague and could allow almost anyone to get their hands on the drug but the state Supreme Court approved it nonethelessAs many as 70 percent of registered Republicans in Florida favored medical marijuana in a November Quinnipiac University poll Support was even higher among Democrats at 87 percent and independents at 88 percentRepublican political consultant Rick Wilson said the party should get out in front of a rapidly

syndrome a rare genetic disorder that causes dozens of seizures daily and must currently take a cocktail of drugs with harmful sideeffectsHsiao and her husband who are Republicans are considering moving to Colorado where Charlottes Web is legal and might also switch their vote if the law is not changedIf they refuse it is because of a willful disregard for the weakest of their constituents And I would not want someone like that in public office said HsiaoOpponents argue that medical marijuana will not be dispensed in a controlled settingThe groups  who have pushed for marijuana to be

the first state with legalized recreational marijuana is one of 20 states across the country that allow medical marijuana New York Washington DC Alaska and Alabama are also grappling with the

almost unanimously this month to oppose medical marijuana saying it would lead to more crime and traffic accidentsPolk County Sheriff Grady Judd who heads the association described the initiative as a fraudulent effort to fully legalize marijuanaIn 2012 law enforcement uncovered 540 marijuana grow houses in Florida more than any other state in the country While medical marijuana legalization will not stop the states black market some law enforcement experts argue it could help reduce the violent crime associated with illegal drugs and reduce the prison populationIn 2010 Florida ranked third in

NYT,http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/01/28/world/americas/ap-lt-mexico-vigilantes.html,MEXICO CITY   After months of tacit cooperation with rural vigilantes trying to drive out a cultlike drug cartel the Mexican government is seeking to permanently solve one of its toughest security problems with a plan to legalize the growing movement and bring it under the armys controlBut the risks are highTo succeed the government must enforce military discipline and instill respect for human rights and due process among more than 20000 heavily armed civilians then eventually disband them and send them back home in the western state of MichoacanIn other Latin American countries similar experiments have created statebacked militias that carried out widespread human rights abuses as armed civilians turned to vengeance or assisted in mass killings The Mexican army itself has been accused of rights abuses during the more than sevenyear war against organized crime that has seen it deployed as a police force in much of the countryVigilante leaders met Tuesday with government officials to hash out details of the agreement that would put avocado and lime pickers with AR15 semiautomatic rifles under army command The Mexican military has a centuryold tradition of mobilizing rural defense corps manned by peasants to fight bandits and uprisings in the countrysideIf the latest experiment works it will resolve one of the thorniest dilemmas in the barely yearold administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto how to handle a movement that sprang up outside the law but successfully took on a pseudoreligious drug cartel the Knights Templar which Mexican authorities had been unwilling or unable to take on for yearsOver the last year the vigilantes many of them former migrant workers who spent years in the United States have seized a dozen towns terrorized by extortion killings and rapes at the hands of the cartels gunmen Members of the Knights Templar have tried to portray themselves as soldiers in a reincarnation of a medieval religious order dedicated to Christianity and the expulsion of abusive police from their communitiesIn many instances Associated Press reporters have witnessed federal forces stand on the sidelines while the selfdefense forces routed the cartel and occasionally even aid the vigilantes by conducting joint patrols and manning highway checkpoints togetherMexican experts so far have widely accepted the administrations plan announced late Monday calling it a smart way to maintain the movements momentum against the Knights Templar while protecting the government against charges it was ceding the rule of law in the hot lands of Michoacan a rugged Pacific Coast state of rich agricultural land and mountains studded by marijuana fields and methamphetamine labsBut in other parts of Latin America the news stirred traumatic memoriesClaudia Samayoa a human rights activist in Guatemala said the thousands of deaths attributed to the armybacked Peasant Self Defense Patrols during the countrys 19601996 civil war are too fresh to allow for more paramilitary forces in the regionThe cure is going to be worse than the disease Samayoa said It would be better not to go down that road and instead strengthen law enforcement and the justice and public safety systemsMargarita Solano of the US riskanalysis firm Southern Pulse said Mexicos vigilantes have awakened memories of her native Colombias experience with selfdefense forces such as the Convivir movement that fought leftistrebels in the 1990s While the groups were initially welcomed some were later accused of rights abusesIm finding differences and certain similarities that are frightening Solano saidMexican authorities are portraying the legalization of the selfdefense forces as a stopgap measure Unable to disarm the vigilantes because of the popular support they have for kicking the Knights Templar out of much of the state federal officials will now have to work with them to clean up the rest of the gang  and then persuade the vigilantes to demobilize The government has stressed the plan is temporary and says vigilantes will have to register their gunsWith selfdefense checkpoints on most major roads in Michoacans hot lands and armed vigilantes often drinking beer or smoking marijuana at their posts there are ample possibilities for abusesBut many Mexicans are less concerned than outsiders about the potential for wrongdoing by the vigilantes They note there are fundamental differences between Michoacan where relatively prosperous farmers are funding the vigilantes to fight cartel extortions and Guatemala Colombia and Peru where poor farmers were pressed by rightwing governments into fighting bitter wars against leftist rebelsIn the rich flat lands of Michoacan there arent any leftist guerrillas or poor farmers said Raul Benitez a security expert at Mexicos National Autonomous University Here there are welloff farmers fighting criminalsUnlike the vigilante movement in the neighboring Mexico state of Guerrero where selfdefense forces are often antigovernment many of Michoacans vigilantes say they just want to get back the rich pasture and lime groves that the Knights Templar stole from themIt is a mixed movement in which upper middleclass orchard owners ranchers and businessmen often pay  farmworkers to help man defense patrols and buy them guns But the poor were also affected by the cartels extortions and abuses and have often have reasons of their own to join the movementThe comparisons with Colombia Peru or Guatemala are an aberration Benitez said Right now the selfdefense forces need the respect of the local residents and public opinion so I think they are not going to commit any crimes
