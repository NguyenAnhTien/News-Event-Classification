to do
-----
put image of bar plots with nmf scores on readme
remove redundancy in readme

have header with 8 major categories
carousel for main article

	Get top and bottom article of the week for each subtopic.
	There are around 22 subtopics and so this would produce 44 possible articles
	article must have image - look at fox news to see if you can get better images
	In the sql query label each article 0 or 1 based on whether they are negative or positive
    Randomly get 8 articles for the carousel and 4 for side panel
    The large main articles in the carousel - title of "Polarizing Topics"
    Show picture underneath
    Have Article title
    Subtitle - Most Violent

    Probably would pick articles with good subtitles - drug cartels, etc..
    Would not use all 44 sub

    Maybe in my database I can find the median value for each subtopic and label the event in the database
    instead of labeling it in python
    put subtopics in a table on their own with their event descriptions

    shorten description of events or make them better

underneath carousel have all 8 categories - possibly in random order
need to incorprate subtopic - possibly in dropdown menu and date in another drop down menu
Subtopics can just be
have 4 highest and lowest scoring articles in both sections with their title for what the event is. "most violent" for example

links at top would go to separate page that would show a more complete list of the top articles in a list like I 
currently have on my page.
