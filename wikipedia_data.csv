Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_assignment,"Route assignment route choice or traffic assignment concerns the selection of routes alternative called paths between origins and destinations in transportation networks It is the fourth step in the conventional transportation forecasting model following trip generation trip distribution and mode choice The zonal interchange analysis of trip distribution provides origindestination trip tables Mode choice analysis tells which travelers will use which mode To determine facility needs and costs and benefits we need to know the number of travelers on each route and link of the network a route is simply a chain of links between an origin and destination We need to undertake traffic or trip assignment Suppose there is a network of highways and transit systems and a proposed addition We first want to know the present pattern of traffic delay and then what would happen if the addition were made   The problem of estimating how many users are on each route is long standing Planners started looking hard at it as freeways and expressways began to be developed The freeway offered a superior level of service over the local street system and diverted traffic from the local system At first diversion was the technique Ratios of travel time were used tempered by considerations of costs comfort and level of service The Chicago Area Transportation Study CATS researchers developed diversion curves for freeways versus local streets There was much work in California also for California had early experiences with freeway planning In addition to work of a diversion sort the CATS attacked some technical problems that arise when one works with complex networks One result was the BoyerMoore Algorithm for finding shortest paths on networks The issue the diversion approach didnt handle was the feedback from the quantity of traffic on links and routes If a lot of vehicles try to use a facility the facility becomes congested and travel time increases Absent some way to consider feedback early planning studies actually most in the period 19601975 ignored feedback They used the Moore algorithm to determine shortest paths and assigned all traffic to shortest paths Thats called all or nothing assignment because either all of the traffic from i to j moves along a route or it does not The allornothing or shortest path assignment is not trivial from a technicalcomputational view Each traffic zone is connected to n  1 zones so there are numerous paths to be considered In addition we are ultimately interested in traffic on links A link may be a part of several paths and traffic along paths has to be summed link by link An argument can be made favoring the allornothing approach It goes this way The planning study is to support investments so that a good level of service is available on all links Using the travel times associated with the planned level of service calculations indicate how traffic will flow once improvements are in place Knowing the quantities of traffic on links the capacity to be supplied to meet the desired level of service can be calculated To take account of the effect of traffic loading on travel times and traffic equilibria several heuristic calculation procedures were developed One heuristic proceeds incrementally The traffic to be assigned is divided into parts usually 4 Assign the first part of the traffic Compute new travel times and assign the next part of the traffic The last step is repeated until all the traffic is assigned The CATS used a variation on this it assigned row by row in the OD table The heuristic included in the FHWA collection of computer programs proceeds another way These procedures seem to work pretty well but they are not exact Dafermos 1968 applied the FrankWolfe algorithm 1956 Florian 1976 which can be used to deal with the traffic equilibrium problem Suppose we are considering a highway network For each link there is a function stating the relationship between resistance and volume of traffic The Bureau of Public Roads BPR developed a link arc congestion or volumedelay or link performance function which we will term Sava  There are other congestion functions The CATS has long used a function different from that used by the BPR but there seems to be little difference between results when the CATS and BPR functions are compared To assign traffic to paths and links we have to have rules and there are the wellknown Wardrop equilibrium 1952 conditions The essence of these is that travelers will strive to find the shortest least resistance path from origin to destination and network equilibrium occurs when no traveler can decrease travel effort by shifting to a new path These are termed user optimal conditions for no user will gain from changing travel paths once the system is in equilibrium The user optimum equilibrium can be found by solving the following nonlinear programming problem  
subject to    where  is the number of vehicles on path r from origin i to destination j So constraint 2 says that all travel must take place i  1  n j  1  n   1 if link a is on path r from i to j zero otherwise So constraint 1 sums traffic on each link There is a constraint for each link on the network Constraint 3 assures no negative traffic An example from Eash Janson and Boyce 1979 will illustrate the solution to the nonlinear program problem There are two links from node 1 to node 2 and there is a resistance function for each link see Figure 1 Areas under the curves in Figure 2 correspond to the integration from 0 to a in equation 1 they sum to 220674 Note that the function for link b is plotted in the reverse direction    Figure 1 Two Route Network Figure 2 Graphical Solution to the Equilibrium Assignment Problem Figure 3 Allocation of Vehicles not Satisfying the Equilibrium Condition At equilibrium there are 2152 vehicles on link a and 5847 on link b Travel time is the same on each route about 63 Figure 3 illustrates an allocation of vehicles that is not consistent with the equilibrium solution The curves are unchanged But with the new allocation of vehicles to routes the shaded area has to be included in the solution so the Figure 3 solution is larger than the solution in Figure 2 by the area of the shaded area There are also methods that have been developed to assign passengers to transit vehicles The urban transportation planning model evolved as a set of steps to be followed and models evolved for use in each step Sometimes there were steps within steps as was the case for the first statement of the Lowry model In some cases it has been noted that steps can be integrated More generally the steps abstract from decisions that may be made simultaneously and it would be desirable to better replicate that in the analysis Disaggregate demand models were first developed to treat the mode choice problem That problem assumes that one has decided to take a trip where that trip will go and at what time the trip will be made They have been used to treat the implied broader context Typically a nested model will be developed say starting with the probability of a trip being made then examining the choice among places and then mode choice The time of travel is a bit harder to treat Wilsons doubly constrained entropy model has been the point of departure for efforts at the aggregate level That model contains the constraint  where the  are the link travel costs  refers to traffic on a link and C is a resource constraint to be sized when fitting the model with data Instead of using that form of the constraint the monotonically increasing resistance function used in traffic assignment can be used The result determines zonetozone movements and assigns traffic to networks and that makes much sense from the way one would imagine the system works  zonetozone traffic depends on the resistance occasioned by congestion Alternatively the link resistance function may be included in the objective function and the total cost function eliminated from the constraints A generalized disaggregate choice approach has evolved as has a generalized aggregate approach The large question is that of the relations between them When we use a macro model we would like to know the disaggregate behavior it represents If we are doing a micro analysis we would like to know the aggregate implications of the analysis Wilson derives a gravitylike model with weighted parameters that say something about the attractiveness of origins and destinations Without too much math we can write probability of choice statements based on attractiveness and these take a form similar to some varieties of disaggregate demand models It has long been recognized that travel demand is influenced by network supply The example of a new bridge opening where none was before inducing additional traffic has been noted for centuries Much research has gone into developing methods for allowing the forecasting system to directly account for this phenomenon Evans 1974 published a doctoral dissertation on a mathematically rigorous combination of the gravity distribution model with the equilibrium assignment model The earliest citation of this integration is the work of Irwin and Von Cube as related by Florian et al 1975 who comment on the work of Evans The work of Evans resembles somewhat the algorithms developed by Irwin and Von Cube  for a transportation study of Toronto Canada Their work allows for feedback between congested assignment and trip distribution although they apply sequential procedures Starting from an initial solution of the distribution problem the interzonal trips are assigned to the initial shortest routes For successive iterations new shortest routes are computed and their lengths are used as access times for input the distribution model The new interzonal flows are then assigned in some proportion to the routes already found The procedure is stopped when the interzonal times for successive iteration are quasiequal Florian et al proposed a somewhat different method for solving the combined distribution assignment applying directly the FrankWolfe algorithm Boyce et al 1988 summarize the research on Network Equilibrium Problems including the assignment with elastic demand A three link problem can not be solved graphically and most transportation network problems involve a large numbers of nodes and links Eash et al for instance studied the road net on DuPage County where there were about 30000 oneway links and 9500 nodes Because problems are large an algorithm is needed to solve the assignment problem and the FrankWolfe algorithm modified a bit since first published is used Start with an all or nothing assignment and then follow the rule developed by FrankWolfe to iterate toward the minimum value of the objective function The algorithm applies successive feasible solutions to achieve convergence to the optimal solution It uses an efficient search procedure to move the calculation rapidly toward the optimal solution Travel times correspond to the dual variables in this programming problem It is interesting that the FrankWolfe algorithm was available in 1956 Its application was developed in 1968 and it took almost another two decades before the first equilibrium assignment algorithm was embedded in commonly used transportation planning software Emme and Emme2 developed by Florian and others in Montreal We would not want to draw any general conclusion from the slow application observation mainly because we can find counter examples about the pace and pattern of technique development For example the simplex method for the solution of linear programming problems was worked out and widely applied prior to the development of much of programming theory The problem statement and algorithm have general applications across civil engineering  hydraulics structures and construction See Hendrickson and Janson 1984",0
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freight_company,Freight companies are companies that specialize in the moving or forwarding of freight or cargo from one place to another These companies are divided into several variant sections For example international freight forwarders ship goods internationally from country to country and domestic freight forwarders ship goods within a single country There are thousands of freight companies in business worldwide many of which are members of certain organizations Such organizations include the IATA International Air Transport Association TIA Transportation Intermediaries Association the BIFA British International Freight Association or the FTA Freight Transport Association and various or other regional organisations There are various methods of shipping goods by air road sea or rail Some companies offer multimodal solutions this means that they offer more than one service in many cases air and sea and in other cases air sea and road The most common multimodal way of shipping is referred to as intermodal meaning truck pickup to rail to truck delivery A shipping method is by evaluating three factors time cost and product characteristics While shipping by sea could take longer than shipping by air the latter is generally more expensive Shipping by rail could also be complemented by piggybacking the freight onto a truck so it can be delivered to the receiver In Schramm the Courts opened the door for freight brokers to be held legally liable in the case of a trucking accident involving a carrier whom they hired to carry freight that resulted in injury to a person Many guidelines most under the FMCSAs SAFER System are available to freight brokers to screen potential carrier safety and if it is proven that the broker did not utilize these government provided tools liability can be transferred to or shared with them in the result of an injury accident,0

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Gabriel,Charles Louis Gabriel 25 June 1857  10 February 1927 was an Australian photographer and medical practitioner He was born in Kempsey a remote New South Wales settlement to Dr Charles Gabriel and Emma Rudder Despite his upbringing in this remote colonial and coastal fringe like his father and grandfather before him Louis became a physician At Scotlands prestigious Edinburgh University he won additional medical qualification in surgery and maternity with distinction On his return voyage he probably practiced his new skills as a ships doctor After practicing briefly in Sydney he left for Gundagai an inland pastoral town half way between Sydney and Melbourne in 1887 The new doctor dedicated himself to medical work only taking up the hobby of photography twelve years later around 1899 Over the following decade or so he produced over eight hundred glass plate negatives many of the images astonishing and accomplished Now in the National Library of Australia NLA they are a valued record of Australiaand Gundagai its most iconic town Contemporary documentaries and articles present his photographs as acutely observed documentary images However he has been quaintly portrayed as a typical country medico a gentleman and talented amateur But his imagery and his story belie it   The Gabriel family heritage is French English West Indian and Welsh However the doctors negroid features made him something of an odd man out in colonial Australia then in the process of creating its White Australia policy He was commonly described as the black doctor His African forebears in four successive generations were dispersed around four continents As a dark skinned doctor in Nineteenth and early Twentieth century Gundagai most commentators have underplayed or ignored this aspect Yet race and colour was always going to be important in a colonial Australia engaged in debate on nation and identity Generations of the Gabriels and millions of Africans had already felt the effects of slavery and dislocation Ironically the French revolutions cry for Liberty Equality and Fraternity meant that a few thousand talented Africans became unwitting participants in the Napoleonic wars and Napoleonic France Over time these outcasts of France developed strategies for coping with the racial suspicions and hostilities faced in everyday life Accomplished black professionals like the Gabriel family sought acceptance through their strength work good deeds local familiarity and importantly longevity of residence in a single location Louis Gabriels life also coincided with a crucial period when Gundagai was cemented into the Australian mythology through stories poetry events and reportage He lived there when the town asserted itself perhaps vaguely at first to be typically Australian democratic equal rugged and practical He practiced in Gundagai from 1887 to his death in 1927 He became Gundagai Hospitals chief and sole medico in 1889 The 1890s depression hit the subscriptionbased funding of the hospital and several disputes with the Management Committee led to his sacking It was another five years before he regained the position after an extended period of bitter conflict with fellow doctor and rival to the hospital position Dr ODwyer Louis Gabriel held this position until his death in 1927 Curiously his position as Government Medical Officer from 1893 had a profound influence on him He championed the causes of Modern Medicine not through surgery  his specialty  but through community and public health He keenly and to his cost persistently advocated improved hygiene standards in food and water in the maintenance of private and public spaces and actions in the prevention of major diseases He particularly campaigned for the introduction of reticulated water supplies and greatest of all construction of a new Gundagai Hospital based on modern medical principles Noteworthy too was his demand that people of all races be equally treated in Gundagai Hospital this at a time when Aborigines were largely forbidden town access Louis Gabriel was Catholic His marriage to Jessie Walton in 1892 appears to have been shortlived On his death Louis Gabriels photographs were stored away and largely forgotten until the 1950s As an important town in the Australian mythology Gabriels photographs were reproduced in local booklets on Gundagais history from the 1950s In the 1970s the images then held by Cliff Butcher and Oscar Bell were donated to the National Library of Australia The town also has a small museum dedicated to him With the National Librarys publication of The Gundagai Album in 1978 there was a new focus on his photographs Many reviewers noted their certain style a way of seeing and organizing people time and place They were personalized sometimes reflective often with a strong sense of the documentary observation informed by his medical training They also made distinctive use of the photographers shadow and the cameras wideangle lens often giving them a sense of paradoxical separation from the subjects and secretive involvement Several television programs followed an entry in the Bicentennial Biography and other publications In 2007 a novel Belonging was written by G McDougall on the doctors life and times The novel integrated Gabriels photographs into the body of the story,0

are plastic cardboard and recyclable metals The Jundiz recycling plant is located in the Basque Country autonomous community particularly in VitoriaGasteiz Jundiz lava This place is responsible for recycling the city garbage The trash is converted by a physicalchemical or mechanical process to submit a substance or a product already used to a cycle of total or partial treatment for a commodity or a new product or raw materials from waste introducing them back into life cycle This occurs at the prospect of depletion of natural resources macro economic and eliminate waste efficiently   Jundiz recycling plant is the first of Basque Country autonomous community Zabalgarbi the facility receives wastes from Bilbao not recycled It is similar to an incinerator being planned for disposing of municipal waste in San Sebastian and other municipalities in Gipuzkoa Compost which so far received only VitoriaGasteiz waste will begin to collect in the coming weeks the rest of lava after proving its effectiveness The Diputation of lava invests 14 million euros in expanding facilities and new systems that treat and 5000 tons annually The expansion of the plant classification of packaging waste in Jundiz already terminated following a statutory investment of 14 million euros The Department of Environment under provincial plans mugarri and Waste proposed the modernization of this plant which already has 9 years of life and dealing with all packaging waste in the Territory with a movement of 5000 tons year With the aim of improving performance in the classification of packaging the concession for operating Jundiz joint venture formed by Yarrow and FCC has undertaken the expansion of the plant with a new building for the reception of waste This ship of 1000 square meters in addition to the existing facility of 2500 square meters to avoid waste reception outdoors In addition to the expansion the plant makes two important technical improvements On the one hand after a feasibility study is launching a pilot mobile facility for the best use of the fraction rejection On the other hand the plant incorporates a new bag opener which increases the capacity and performance at the beginning of the treatment process The facilities are varied To begin with a ship has reception waste This ship of 1000 square meters are attached to the existing 2500 square meters to avoid waste reception outdoors It has a digester that converts organic waste into fertilizer and methane in the process that gives off the premises to generate electricity Has also launched a pilot mobile facility for the better use of the fraction of rejection This machine is intended advantage the20 of the sewage reaching the plant from the yellow bins The plant also incorporates a system of open bags to enhance the ability and performance in the treatment process Finally includes the construction of a wind turbine that provides the10 of the electric power consumed by the plant The compost is the product obtained by composting and constitutes an average of decomposition of organic matter which itself is a good fertilizer Humus is called the higher decomposition of organic matter The compost humus is used as fertilizer both organic Organic matter decomposes via aerobic or Anaerobic digestion means Call composting aerobic cycle high presence of oxygen decomposition of organic matter Called digestion anaerobic cycle with no or little presence of oxygen decomposition of organic matter The compost is naturally obtained by decomposing aerobic with oxygen of organic waste and plant debris animal excrement and slurry through the mass reproduction of thermophilic aerobic bacteria that are present naturally in any place later the continue fermentation the other species of bacteria fungus and Actinobacteria Typically this is to avoid if possible the putrefaction of organic waste excess water preventing aerationoxygenation and creates smelly anaerobic biological conditions although some industrial composting processes used by anaerobic bacteria of putrefaction Compost produced in a gardenThe compost used in agriculture and gardening as an amendment to the soil fertilizer but also used in landscaping erosion control coatings and soil remediation In addition to its direct use composting involves a strategic and environmentally acceptable solution to the problem created by large urban centers and their organic household solid waste and agricultural forestry and livestock whose organic waste should be treated Composting is an alternative technology to others that are not always respectful of natural resources and environment and also have a high cost In Jundiz they use an inndustrial composting systems that are increasingly being installed as a waste management alternative to landfills along with other advanced waste processing systems Mechanical sorting of mixed waste streams combined with anaerobic digestion or invessel composting is called mechanical biological treatment increasingly used in developed countries due to regulations controlling the amount of organic matter allowed in landfills Treating biodegradable waste before it enters a landfill reduces global warming from fugitive methane untreated waste breaks down anaerobically in a landfill producing landfill gas that contains methane a potent greenhouse gas Largescale composting systems are used by many urban centers around the world Cocomposting is a technique which combines solid waste with dewatered biosolids although difficulties controlling inert and plastic contamination from municipal solid waste makes this approach less attractive Jundiz recycling plant genereted 5000 tons of fertilizer last yearCompostplantopened in November 2006 at the site of Jndiz swallowed up 50000 tonnes of waste deposited by the citizens in the gray container which was incorporated last twelve months The huge stomach of the facility has become half of those remains at 5000 tonnes five million kilosin organic fertilizer called compost Latest wins fertilizer were obtained a few days ago as the system digestive of Biocompost takes eight weeks to complete the decomposition of food waste in the compound of earthy appearance that the processor tries to sell to farmers Ensure that there is no risks to crops In short each bag an average of ten kilos 440 have become compost 800grams have been destined for recycling and the remaining 480 kilos have been concentrated to reduce its volume and minimize the cost to transport to landfill Before the start of the digestion a complex chain of filters hoppers and magnets separated from the contents of the bags in metals plastics and cardboard for recycling and other recyclable materials and articles which by their size they could not be recycled or decomposed  The first twelve months have brought in 4000 tons 4 million kilos which Biocompost sold to recyclers The remains disposable which is compressed into blocks to be taken to the landfill totaling 24000 tons almost half of what swallowed by the installation Industrial systems A large and over sized compost pile that is steaming with the heat generated by thermophilic microorganisms There are a number of anaerobic organism that are involved in the process of anaerobic digestion including acetic acidforming bacteria acetogens and methaneforming methanogens These organisms feed upon the initial feedstock which undergoes a number of different processes converting it to intermediate molecules including sugars hydrogen and acetic acid before finally being converted to biogas Different species of bacteria are able to survive at different temperature ranges Ones living optimally at temperatures between 3540 C are called mesophiles or mesophilic bacteria Some of the bacteria can survive at the hotter and more hostile conditions of 5560 C these are called thermophileMethanogens come from the domain of archaea This family includes species that can grow in the hostile conditions of hydrothermal vents These species are more resistant to heat and can therefore operate at high temperatures a property that is unique to thermophile As with aerobic systems the bacteria in anaerobic systems the growing and reproducing microorganisms within them require a source of elemental oxygen to survive In an anaerobic system there is an absence of gaseous oxygen Gaseous oxygen is prevented from entering the system through physical containment in sealed tanks Anaerobes access oxygen from sources other than the surrounding air The oxygen source for these microorganisms can be the organic material itself or alternatively may be supplied by inorganic oxides from within the input material When the oxygen source in an anaerobic system is derived from the organic material itself then the intermediate end products are primarily alcohols aldehydes and organic acids plus carbon dioxide In the presence of specialised methanogens the intermediates are converted to the final end products of methane carbon dioxide with trace levels of hydrogen sulfideIn an anaerobic system the majority of the chemical energy contained within the starting material is released by methanogenic bacteria as methane Populations of anaerobic microorganisms typically take a significant period of time to establish themselves to be fully effective It is therefore common practice to introduce anaerobic microorganisms from materials with existing populations a process known as seeding the digesters and typically takes place with the addition of sewage sludge or cattle slurry The key process stages of anaerobic digestion There are four key biological and chemical stages of anaerobic digestion 1 Hydrolysis 2 Acidogenesis 3 Acetogenesis 4 Methanogenesis In most cases biomass is made up of large organic polymers In order for the bacteria in anaerobic digesters to access the energy potential of the material these chains must first be broken down into their smaller constituent parts These constituent parts or monomers such as sugars are readily available by other bacteria The process of breaking these chains and dissolving the smaller molecules into solution is called hydrolysis Therefore hydrolysis of these high molecular weight polymeric components is the necessary first step in anaerobic digestion Through hydrolysis the complex organic molecules are broken down into simple sugars acids and fatty acids Acetate and Hydrogen are produced in the first stages can be used directly by methanogens Molecules such as volatile fatty acids with a chain length that is greater than acetate must first be catabolised into compounds that can be directly utilised by methanogens The biological process of acidogenesis is where there is further breakdown of the remaining components by acidogenic fermentative bacteria Here VFAs are created along with ammonia carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide as well as other byproducts The process of acidogenesis is similar to the way that milk sours The third stage anaerobic digestion is acetogenesis Here simple molecules created through the acidogenesis phase are further digested by an acetogens to produce largely acetic acid as well as carbon dioxide and hydrogen The terminal stage of anaerobic digestion is the biological process of methanogenesis Here methanogens utilise the intermediate products of the preceding stages and convert them into methane carbon dioxide and water It is these components that makes up the majority of the biogas emitted from the systemMethanogenesis is sensitive to both high and low pHs and occurs between pH 65 and pH 8 The remaining nondigestible material which the microbes cannot feed upon along with any dead bacterial remains constitutes the digestate A simplified generic chemical equation for the overall processes outlined above is as follows C6H12O6  3CO2 + 3CH4 A batch system is the simplest form of digestion Biomass is added to the reactor at the start of the process in a batch and is sealed for the duration of the process Batch reactors suffer from odour issues that can be a severe problem when they are emptied Typically biogas production will be formed with a normal distribution pattern over time The operator can use this fact to determine when they believe the process of digestion of the organic matter has completed As the batch digestion is simple and requires less equipment and lower levels of design work it is typically a cheaper form of digestion In continuous digestion processes organic matter is constantly added continuous complete mixedor added in stages to the reactor continuous plug flow first in  first out Here the end products are constantly or periodically removed resulting in constant production of biogas A single or multiple digesters in sequence may be used Examples of this form of anaerobic digestion include continuous stirredtank reactors CSTRs low anaerobic sludge blanket UASB Expanded granular sludge bed EGSB and Internal circulation reactors IC Temperature There are two conventional operational temperature levels for anaerobic digesters which are determined by the species of methanogens in the digesters  Mesophilic which takes place optimally around 3038 C or at ambient temperatures between 2045 C where mesophiles are the primary microorganisms present  Thermophilic which takes plae around 4957 C at elevated temperatures up to 70 C where thermophiles are the primary microorganisms present There are a greater number of species of mesophiles than thermophiles  These bacteria are also more tolerant to changes in environmental conditions than thermophiles Mesophilic systems are therefore considered to be more stable than thermophilic digestion systems As mentioned above thermophilic digestion systems are considered to be less stable the energy input is higher and more energy is removed from the organic matter However the increased temperatures facilitate faster reaction rates and hence faster gas yields Operation at higher temperatures facilitates greater sterilization of the end digestate In countries where legislation such as the Animal ByProducts Regulations in the European Union requires end products to meet certain levels of reduction in the amount of bacteria in the output material this may be a benefit Certain processes shred the waste finely and use a short high temperature and pressure pretreatment pasteurization  hygienisation stage that significantly enhances the gas output of the following standard mesophilic stage The hygienisation process is also applied in order to reduce the pathogenic microorganisms in the feedstock Hygienisation  pasteurization may be achieved by using a Landia BioChop hygienisation unit or similar method of combined heat treatment and solids maceration A drawback of operating at thermophilic temperatures is that more heat energy input is required to achieve the correct operational temperatures This increase in energy may not be outweighed by the increase in the outputs of biogas from the systems It is therefore important to consider an energy balance for these systems There are three principal products of anaerobic digestion biogas digestate and water Typical composition of biogas Matter  Methane CH4 5075 Carbon dioxide CO2 2550 Nitrogen N2 010 Hydrogen H2 01 Hydrogen sulfide H2S 03 Oxygen O2 02 Biogas from sewage works is sometimes used to run a gas engine to produce electrical power some or all of which can be used to run the sewage works Some waste heat from the engine is then used to heat the digester It turns out that the waste heat is generally enough to heat the digester to the required temperatures The power potential from sewage works is limitedThe scope for biogas generation from nonsewage waste biological matter  energy crops food waste abattoir waste etc is much higher estimated to be capable of about 3000 MW Farm biogas plants using animal waste and energy crops are expected to contribute to reducing CO2 emissions and strengthen the grid while providing farmers with additional revenues Some countries offer incentives in the form of for example Feedin Tariffs for feeding electricity onto the power grid in order to subsidize green energy production In Jundiz it is burned methane from organic waste to generate electricity for 12000 homes The transformation of waste into compost has been harnessed to generate electricity And is that the smaller organic waste 8000 tons were shut for a month in a tower to collect the methane produced in decomposition The combustion of this gas move an alternator that generated six million kilowatts This electricity while supporting all of the recycling machinery led light for 12000 homes Finally it is noteworthy that already under construction to install a wind turbine will provide 10 of the electricity consumed by the plant The intended use is to energy ie converting the waste into fuel which may be used in processes such as cement This will replace traditional fuels such as diesel and minimizing what is currently sent to landfill Gardelegi,0

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon_Force,The Gideon Force was a small Britishled African special force which acted as a Corps dElite amongst the Sudan Defence Force and irregular Ethiopian forces fighting the Italian occupation forces in Ethiopia during the East African Campaign of World War II The leader and creator of the force was Major Orde Wingate   Italy occupied parts of Ethiopia in 1936 and eventually created Italian East Africa covering modernday Ethiopia Eritrea and Somalia Italian troops in Ethiopia numbered about 250000 most of them native Eritreans and Ethiopians recruited into the Italian army When Italian dictator Benito Mussolini declared war against France and Britain in June 1940 Italian forces became a potential threat to British supply routes in the Red Sea and the Suez Canal British troops in Egypt and the Sudan were outnumbered relative to the Italian forces in Ethiopia and Libya This was put into stark perspective when Italian troops made advances to capture territory on the borders of Kenya and the Sudan in June and July before moving to conquer British Somaliland in August Short of men General Archibald Wavell the CommanderinChief of the British Middle East Command needed all of the local support he could find One answer was Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia The deposed emperor had been living in England ever since the Italians invaded his country in 1936 during the Second ItaloAbyssinian War Ethiopian resistance fighters called Arbegnoch Patriots had been fighting the Italians ever since the beginning of the occupation They would raid Italian forts and communication lines However they hardly cooperated at all and the Italians were often able to play one group against another On 18 February Gideon Force started crossing over the escarpment into the eastern part of Gojjam Aided by Arbegnoch fighters they attacked the Italian forts garrisons and patrols Also due to the advance of Cunninghams forces in Somalia the Italians withdrew eastward from their positions On 24 February Wingate led Gideon Force to surround the Italian fort at Bure Some of the Ethiopian force got lost and a grass fire hindered them but they met with no Italian resistance Wingate tried to give an impression of a larger force to intimidate the Italians he spread the men wide and again accompanied by the Arbegnoch began to ambush the Italians Wingate led some groups himself At the same time Selassie approached the area Formerly neutral or proItalian local rulers turned to support him Ethiopian irregulars attached to Italian units known as banda began to desert to the Emperors side The numerically superior Italians retreated to the southeast on 4 March The British command in Khartoum which had cracked the Italian codes informed Wingate of the move He ordered a Sudanese unit to block and ambush the Italians but the commander of the unit failed to do so Disappointed Wingate ordered a pursuit and his men made small harassing attacks against the Italians The Italians pushed through a small Ethiopian force near Dembecha on the Chakara River with 325 casualties Ethiopian casualties were only 48 The Italian commander of Dembecha also retreated to the east against his orders and Gideon Force occupied Dembecha on 8 March The next target of the combined British force was a fort near Debre Marqos This time the Italians counterattacked and fierce fighting ensued Gideon Force retreated and began hitandrun attacks and raids to drain Italian strength Italian losses amounted to 200 over the next weeks Their intention to evacuate was blocked by the Arbegnoch A couple of days after the Italians had left Debra Marqos Haile Selassie entered the city on 6 April At the same time British regular forces entered Addis Ababa Other Italian forces retreating to the east and over the Blue Nile were continuously harassed by the Arbegnoch and Gideon Force However some Arbegnoch began looting in the retaken areas and Gideon Force had to restore order When most of Gideon Force were ordered to Addis Ababa which had been occupied by Cunninghams troops on 6 April a smaller force Safforce under Mission 101 pursued retreating Italians to the north towards Debre Sina While this was going on on 5 May Emperor Selassie made his formal entry into Addis Ababa with a victory march in which most of Gideon Force were required to provide his escort After the ceremonies Wingate returned to Safforce Shortly after his return Wingate received an order from Cunningham to stop the pursuit of retreating Italians and help other British forces elsewhere He pretended that he could not decipher the message and continued on his course The other part of the Gideon Force led by the explorer Wilfred Thesiger crossed to the north of the Debra Sinai plateau and attacked from the north On 18 May the Italians found themselves blocked from the north and south Thinking he faced superior numbers the Italian commander agreed to surrender on 24 May The Gideon Force was officially disbanded on 1 June 1941 Wingate returned to Egypt Many of the troops from the Gideon Force were transferred to North Africa and attached to the 8th Army Long Range Desert Group LRDG The last Italian troops surrendered in Begemder province in the north to British and Arbegnoch forces With the surrender of the Italians the British under pressure from the US administration signed an agreement acknowledging Ethiopian sovereignty in January 1942 Wingate came down with malaria and was sent back to Britain by troop ship much to the relief of the general staff in Cairo who had feared that he would get involved in the post war politics of Ethiopia They also ignored Wingates request for decorations for his men and obstructed his attempts to get backpay for his force While still in Cairo out of frustration Wingate had written a report for Wavell the CommanderinChief Middle East in which he outlined the successes of the campaign and his views on future actions of a similar type He wrote in part To sum up it is proposed to assemble and employ a force of the highest fighting qualities capable of employment in widely separated columnsthat it should be allocated an objective behind the enemys lines the gaining of which will decisively affect the campaign and that to enable it to carry out its task it must be given a political doctrine consonant with our war aims His report impressed the Secretary of State for India Leopold Amery who persuaded Wingate to remove the recriminations in the paper and then passed it to the War Cabinet and Winston Churchill He also notified Wavell who was now CommanderinChief India that Wingate had been declared medically fit In February 1942 Wingate left London for Burma at the request of India Command It was there that Wingate further developed his ideas and put them into practice when he formed the Chindits,0
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_motor,Molecular motors are biological molecular machines that are the essential agents of movement in living organisms In general terms a motor may be defined as a device that consumes energy in one form and converts it into motion or mechanical work for example many proteinbased molecular motors harness the chemical free energy released by the hydrolysis of ATP in order to perform mechanical work Because the motor events are stochastic molecular motors are often modeled with the FokkerPlanck equation or with Monte Carlo methods These theoretical models are especially useful when treating the molecular motor as a Brownian motor In experimental biophysics the activity of molecular motors is observed with many different experimental approaches among them Many more techniques are also used As new technologies and methods are developed it is expected that knowledge of naturally occurring molecular motors will be helpful in constructing synthetic nanoscale motors Recently chemists and those involved in nanotechnology have begun to explore the possibility of creating molecular motors de novo These synthetic molecular motors currently suffer many limitations that confine their use to the research laboratory However many of these limitations may be overcome as our understanding of chemistry and physics at the nanoscale increases Systems like the nanocars while not technically motors are illustrative of recent efforts towards synthetic nanoscale motors,0

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_podzolic,Brown podzolic soils are a subdivision of the Podzolic soils in the British soil classification Although classed with podzols because they have an ironrich or spodic horizon they are in fact intermediate between podzols and Brown earths They are common on hilly land in western Europe in climates where precipitation of more than about 900mm exceeds evapotranspiration for a large part of the year and summers are relatively cool The result is that leaching of the soil profile occurs in which mobile chemicals are washed out of the topsoil or A horizon and accumulate lower down in the B horizon These soils have large amounts more than 5 of organic carbon in the surface horizon which is therefore dark in colour In unploughed situations there may be a mor humus layer in which the surface organic matter is only weakly mixed with the mineral component Unlike podzols proper these soils have no continuous leached E horizon This is because they are formed on slopes where over long periods the topsoil weathered from higher up the slope is continually being carried down the slope by the action of rain gravity and faunal activity This means that fresh supplies of iron and aluminium oxides sesquioxides are constantly being provided and leaching ensures a net accumulation of these compounds in the B horizon giving an orangebrown rusty colour which is very distinctive The aluminum and ferric iron compounds in the subsoil also tend to bind the soil particles together giving a pellety fine structure to the soil and improving permeability so that despite being in relatively high rainfall areas the soils do not have the grey colours or mottles of gley soils In the World Reference Base for Soil Resources shows a preponderance of this kind of soil in northwest Spain There is a tendency for the soils to occur in oceanic areas where there is abundant rainfall throughout the year winters are mild and summers relatively cool Thus they are common in Ireland Scotland Wales where they occupy about 20 of the country and western England especially Devon Cornwall and the Lake District They also occur in the Appalachian Mountains and on the west coast of North America,0
Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring,In graph theory graph coloring is a special case of graph labeling it is an assignment of labels traditionally called colors to elements of a graph subject to certain constraints In its simplest form it is a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color this is called a vertex coloring Similarly an edge coloring assigns a color to each edge so that no two adjacent edges share the same color and a face coloring of a planar graph assigns a color to each face or region so that no two faces that share a boundary have the same color Vertex coloring is the starting point of the subject and other coloring problems can be transformed into a vertex version For example an edge coloring of a graph is just a vertex coloring of its line graph and a face coloring of a plane graph is just a vertex coloring of its dual However nonvertex coloring problems are often stated and studied as is That is partly for perspective and partly because some problems are best studied in nonvertex form as for instance is edge coloring The convention of using colors originates from coloring the countries of a map where each face is literally colored This was generalized to coloring the faces of a graph embedded in the plane By planar duality it became coloring the vertices and in this form it generalizes to all graphs In mathematical and computer representations it is typical to use the first few positive or nonnegative integers as the colors In general one can use any finite set as the color set The nature of the coloring problem depends on the number of colors but not on what they are Graph coloring enjoys many practical applications as well as theoretical challenges Beside the classical types of problems different limitations can also be set on the graph or on the way a color is assigned or even on the color itself It has even reached popularity with the general public in the form of the popular number puzzle Sudoku Graph coloring is still a very active field of research Note Many terms used in this article are defined in Glossary of graph theory   The first results about graph coloring deal almost exclusively with planar graphs in the form of the coloring of maps While trying to color a map of the counties of England Francis Guthrie postulated the four color conjecture noting that four colors were sufficient to color the map so that no regions sharing a common border received the same color Guthries brother passed on the question to his mathematics teacher Augustus de Morgan at University College who mentioned it in a letter to William Hamilton in 1852 Arthur Cayley raised the problem at a meeting of the London Mathematical Society in 1879 The same year Alfred Kempe published a paper that claimed to establish the result and for a decade the four color problem was considered solved For his accomplishment Kempe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and later President of the London Mathematical Society The compiler constructs an interference graph where vertices are variables and an edge connects two vertices if they are needed at the same time If the graph can be colored with k colors then any set of variables needed at the same time can be stored in at most k registers The problem of coloring a graph has found a number of applications including pattern matching The recreational puzzle Sudoku can be seen as completing a 9coloring on given specific graph with 81 vertices An important class of improper coloring problems is studied in Ramsey theory where the graphs edges are assigned to colors and there is no restriction on the colors of incident edges A simple example is the friendship theorem which states that in any coloring of the edges of  the complete graph of six vertices there will be a monochromatic triangle often illustrated by saying that any group of six people either has three mutual strangers or three mutual acquaintances Ramsey theory is concerned with generalisations of this idea to seek regularity amid disorder finding general conditions for the existence of monochromatic subgraphs with given structure Coloring can also be considered for signed graphs and gain graphs,0

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pram%C4%81%E1%B9%87a-samuccaya,The Pramasamuccaya A Compendium of Validities is a work by Dignga the early medieval Indian Buddhist logician and epistemologist which may be seen as the definitive statement of his epistemological work The work comprises an outline in the highly elliptical verse format typical of early Indian philosophical texts and an explanatory autocommentary Chapter 1 opens with the statement that there are only two means of knowledge direct perception and inference Corresponding to these we have two objects particulars and universals Direct perception is knowledge which excludes conceptual thought kalpan This only reveals the bare features of an object via the senses This knowledge is inexpressible in words relating to real objects and ultimate reality Errors of perception arise through misinterpretations by conceptual thought Each item of sense perception is unique Dignga does not specify what the nature of the object of perception is but implies that although it is not atomic or otherwise it is existent It is real because it is causally efficient arthakriy Chapter 2 deals with inference for oneself svaarthaanuma This is knowledge of what can be inferred through a middle term liga which has the three characteristics for a valid middle term namely that it is concomitantly present in the thesis present in a similar example and absent from a dissimilar example According to Dignga inference only deals with universals and is always dependent upon the subjectobject relation Chapter 3 deals with inference for other paraarthaanuma the process by which one makes public what one knows by formal means using a syllogistic means of argument This typically takes the following form Chapter 4 deals with examples and how they are to be used and how to select relevant examples In Digngas method of syllogistic logic agreeing and different examples are needed to establish concomitance of the middle term Chapter 5 deals with the exclusion of other anyaapoha Here Dignga first eliminates authority as a separate valid means of knowledge stating that it is a kind of inference Authority is acceptable only if it does not contradict ones own perception and inference Dignga states that conceptual knowledge derives from words but asks what do words mean He proposes that words express their meaning by exclusion of opposite meanings Words do not denote real universals as there is no necessary connection between words and universals Instead words only express imaginary concepts and vice versa In Digngas view words do not produce knowledge by referring to particular objects but only demark X from nonX That is the word white does not bring about knowledge of all white objects but only demarks white from nonwhite In this way some form of classification is possible in the mind through this process of distinctions This is done by the internal application of agreement and difference so he maintains that speech derives from inference However he adds the proviso that this process is aided by direct perception which helps avoid fallacies Thus the imagined world of universals can be made to fit the real world by correcting contradictions in the light of direct perception After Digngas lifetime Dharmakrti compiled his Pramavrttika which may be seen as an extended commentary on Digngas Pramasamuccaya with the purpose of correcting philosophical difficulties that had subsequently become apparent Anyapoha The Context of the Discussion of the Doctrine Apohavada in Pramanasamuccaya  At the outset in the Pramanasamuccaya Dingnaga has stated that the main idea behind writing the work is to remove misapprehensions about the acquisition of knowledge These misapprehensions are that there are more than two means of acquiring valid knowledge According to him the objects of knowledge prameya are divided into two the unique selfcharacteristic svalakaksana  and the generic classcharacteristics samanya laksana  and with reference to these two kinds of prameyas two means of valid knowledge perception pratyaksa and inference anumana are requisitioned by the former we apprehend the svalkaaa aspect of things which alone is perceptible pratyaksa and by the latter the samanya laksana which is imperceptible paroksa As there can not be more than two kinds of prameyas there can not be more than two pramanas pratyaksa and anumana Any belief that is not founded upon these two must be discarded as an unwarranted belief7 The discussion on means if any of acquiring knowledge outside sensation and well founded reasoning is the main theme of the fifth chapter viz apoha of Pramanasamuccaya The main object behind writing this chapter is to enforce upon the idea that apart from sensation and reasoning all other means of acquiring knowledge named by others such as through words can be reduced to forms of reasoning The reduction of the validity of words to the validity of reasoning made this philosophy controversial Dingnaga emphasised that a word had no validity without reason He says that the statements of credible persons are inference insofar as they have the common character of not being false Present in the object of inference and in what is similar to it and absent in their absence Dinga perhaps was the first Buddhist philosopher to point out

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_modeling,Solid modeling or modelling is a consistent set of principles for mathematical and computer modeling of threedimensional solids Solid modeling is distinguished from related areas of geometric modeling and computer graphics by its emphasis on physical fidelity Another type of modeling technique is surfacing Freeform surface modeling Here surfaces are defined trimmed and merged and filled to make solid The surfaces are usually defined with datum curves in space and a variety of complex commands Surfacing is more difficult but better applicable to some manufacturing techniques like injection molding Solid models for injection molded parts usually have both surfacing and sketcher based features Engineering drawings can be created semiautomatically and reference the solid models Parametric modeling uses parameters to define a model dimensions for example Examples of parameters are dimensions used to create model features material density formulas to describe swept features imported data that describe a reference surface for example The parameter may be modified later and the model will update to reflect the modification Typically there is a relationship between parts assemblies and drawings A part consists of multiple features and an assembly consists of multiple parts Drawings can be made from either parts or assemblies Example A shaft is created by extruding a circle 100mm A hub is assembled to the end of the shaft Later the shaft is modified to be 200mm long click on the shaft select the length dimension modify to 200 When the model is updated the shaft will be 200mm long the hub will relocate to the end of the shaft to which it was assembled and the engineering drawings and mass properties will reflect all changes automatically Related to parameters but slightly different are constraints Constraints are relationships between entities that make up a particular shape For a window the sides might be defined as being parallel and of the same length Parametric modeling is obvious and intuitive But for the first three decades of CAD this was not the case Modification meant redraw or add a new cut or protrusion on top of old ones Dimensions on engineering drawings were created instead of shown Parametric modeling is very powerful but requires more skill in model creation A complicated model for an injection molded part may have a thousand features and modifying an early feature may cause later features to fail Skillfully created parametric models are easier to maintain and modify Parametric modeling also lends itself to data reuse A whole family of capscrews can be contained in one model for example Modern computed axial tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scanners can be used to create solid models of internal body features socalled volume rendering Optical 3D scanners can be used to create point clouds or polygon mesh models of external body features Uses of medical solid modeling If the use goes beyond visualization of the scan data processes like image segmentation and imagebased meshing will be necessary to generate an accurate and realistic geometrical description of the scan data Because CAD programs running on computers understand the true geometry comprising complex shapes many attributes offor a 3D solid such as its center of gravity volume and mass can be quickly calculated For instance the cube shown at the top of this article measures 84mm from flat to flat Despite its many radii and the shallow pyramid on each of its six faces its properties are readily calculated for the designer as shown in the screenshot at right,0

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Blackadder,Edmund Blackadder is the single name given to a collection of fictional characters who appear in the BBC mockhistorical comedy series Blackadder each played by Rowan Atkinson Although each series is set within a different period of British history each character is part of the same familial dynasty and is usually called Edmund Blackadder Each character also shares notable personality traits and characteristics throughout each incarnation while each individual incarnation may be found in different circumstances they are usually considered to be the same character   Although each Blackadder is positioned in a different place in British society over each series generally falling in class over the centuries starting out as the Kings nephew at the very beginning of series one before he mistakes his uncle for an enemy commander kills him and allows his father played by Brian Blessed to assume the throne and ending as a front line soldier a Captain in the British Army of World War I there are certain common characteristics that each Blackadder shares Throughout each series Blackadder is a selfserving cynical opportunist concerned solely with increasing his own influence and status within his society and usually making a lot of money along the way rather than serving any idealistic goals His character is symbolized by the adder the United Kingdoms only native venomous snake which sometimes appears in the series as a visual motif With the exception of the first Blackadder incarnation Prince Edmund each Blackadder is generally witty charming and intelligent While he is beset by bad luck he is usually very capable of manipulating his way out of a crisis and in securing for himself some degree of prestige and fortune Blackadder is also usually one of the few intelligent people present at any given time and usually is surrounded by incompetent stupid and at times mad servants equals and superiors As a result he possesses a scathing wit and is usually prepared with numerous sarcastic putdowns which are often wasted on those they are directed at He always has an amusingly exaggerated simile to describe whatever situation he finds himself in He is frequently present at some of the defining moments of British history but usually views his contemporaries with unbridled contempt regardless of their historical importance or interest In particular he tends to comment sardonically on what might to modern eyes be considered the more ludicrous follies of history from the injustice of the medieval witchhunts to the petty whims and stupidities of various British monarchs to the pointless butchery of World War I As a result he is something of a modern perspective placed in past societies He is also generally dismissive of the contemporary arts and culture in the various eras in which he lives such as medieval folk pageants Shakespeare Georgian Romanticist poetry theatre and Charlie Chaplin films Each Blackadder is also surrounded by various other figures who reappear over the series Most such as his repulsive manservant Baldrick and the various imbecilic aristocrats with whose company he is lumbered such as Lord Percy Percy or George are usually hindrances to him of whom he is repeatedly incapable of ridding himself There is also usually another main character who is on a par with him in terms of intelligence and serves as someone for him to play games of oneupmanship with such as Lord Melchett and Captain Darling but these characters are typically sycophantic toadies who suck up to their superiors like Queenie and General Melchett whom Blackadder himself is also forced to reluctantly serve In this section brief descriptions of the various Edmund Blackadders who have appeared in their own series or in another notable Blackadder production are provided Prince Edmund is the first man in the dynasty to refer to himself as the Black Adder although in Blackadder Back and Forth a centurion in Roman Britain also possesses a similar name The first Blackadder is named after the treacherous Edmond from Shakespeares King Lear He appears in the first series The Black Adder set shortly after The Wars of the Roses He is the second son of the fictional King Richard IV of England who we are told at the beginning was cast from all historical references by his successor Henry Tudor Prince Edmund is a very different character from his descendants he is slowwitted and when he carries out something Machiavellian he is shown as halfhearted or regretful This is demonstrated in the first episode when after accidentally cutting off the kings head he later returns to haunt him in a Macbethlike scene at the banquet The Prince does show wit on occasion and is creatively insulting although with the exception of Baldrick and Percy it is usually once his target is out of sight He can be cunning and devious himself but usually needs more help than his descendantsoccasionally claiming Baldricks plans as his own after dismissing them moments before He is shown to have a talent for swordfighting in The Archbishop For all this he is determined and driven to power his primary concern is to seize the English throne and become king After the death of Richard IV and Edmunds older brother Harry he is briefly King of England a lyric one of the closing credits for Blackadder II describes him as a king  Although for only thirty seconds Prince Edmund is one of the many Blackadders to be killed on screen he dies after accidentally drinking poisoned wine although he had already been severely mutilated by the Duke of Burgundy Edmund Lord Blackadder is the nextseen member of the dynasty appearing in Elizabethan England He is the central character of Blackadder II and is a nobleman in the court of Elizabeth I of England Although his greatgrandfather was Prince Edmund he is much more intelligent reserved charming handsome and witty than his ancestor Despite that fact Edmunds aristocracy has lowered he is now simply a lord rather than a Prince His main concerns are pleasing his Queen depicted here as a childish spoiled tyrant and in outwitting his various contemporary rivals usually in the form of Lord Melchett for her favour At the end of his series this Edmund was murdered by Prince Ludwig the Indestructible of Germany Blackadder thought he had murdered Ludwig but at the end of the credits Ludwig came back and murdered Edmund Queenie and the rest of the court He then posed as Queenie after the assassination The character shift from Prince Edmund in the first series to Lord Blackadder in the second is credited to the involvement of Ben Elton who joined as the shows cowriter alongside Richard Curtis The latter Edmund became the de facto archetype nearly all subsequent Blackadders in the series were modelled after Edmund Lord Blackadder the exceptions being MacAdder who appeared as a cameo in the finale of Blackadder the Third and Ebenezer Blackadder who initially began as the nicest man in England to the point of naivete but who gradually fell back into the standard persona Mr Edmund Blackadder Esquire is the Blackadder appearing in the Regency period of British history His family having fallen on hard times he is reduced to a life of servitude a fall made even more insufferable by his position as butler to the oafish and uncouth George the Prince Regent Despite this he remains keenly intelligent by far sharper than most of the people he associates with and is usually found stealing from his employer This is the only one of the main four incarnations not to be killed onscreen the first two are murdered whilst the fourth dies in battle this time out hes mistaken for the Prince of Wales by a befuddled George III and taken home to the royal court MacAdder is the Scottish Cousin of Mr E Blackadder He is known as being the most dangerous man ever to wear a skirt in Europe He believes he is rightful king of England and plans to incite rebellion meaning his cousin hates him He is apparently a skilled swordsman but also a kipper salesman and married to a woman named Morag back in Scotland though he begins an affair with Mrs Miggins He had two children a boy named Jamie and a girl named Angus who together make up the entire army of the Clan MacAdder Edmund Blackadder wants him to take his place in the duel with the Iron Duke of Wellington but MacAdder prefers to contemplate the possibility of taking the Dukes place to kill the Prince in order to be crowned with the ancient stone bonnet of McAdders However when Edmund Blackadder tells MacAdder that if he does this he will incur the wrath of the bailiffs MacAdder thereby declines and leaves for Scotland with Miggins foiling Blackadders plan Ebenezer Blackadder the Victorian Blackadder appears in Blackadders Christmas Carol Unlike his miserly cynical ancestors he is by repute the nicest man in Victorian England Unfortunately this only serves to make him a target for the cynical crooks and cheats he is surrounded by and a Christmas Carollike encounter with a Ghost of Christmas Past sees him greatly inspired by his snideyettriumphant ancestors and he sees if he becomes bad his descendants will rule the universe if not they will end up as Baldricks slaves in the same time period Captain Edmund Blackadder appears in Blackadder Goes Forth and is an officer in the British Army during World War I Characteristically reluctant to meet his end in the mud of the trenches of the Western Front this Blackadders sole goal is to escape his inevitable fate Blackadders attempts to escape are opposed by Melchett who does not realise the futility of the war and Melchetts assistant Captain Darling who does Darling and Blackadder have a natural animosity towards one another since Darling is aware that Blackadder is attempting to avoid his duty while Blackadder hates Darling for his comfortable position several miles behind the front This animosity fades away and turns into a mutual respect for one another when Darling is given a frontline commission by Melchett as Blackadder and Darling are both aware that they are both very likely to be killed once going over the top Blackadder shares his trench with Private S Baldrick and Lt The Hon George Colthurst St Barleigh Although wellintentioned both fail to understand their predicament and demonstrate a high level of incompetence hindering Blackadders escape attempts and augmenting his sense of frustration In the series finale Goodbyeee Captain Blackadder and his company go over the top in 1917 to their implied deaths Lord Edmund Blackadder is the modern representative of the Blackadder family He intends to play a turnofthemillenniumprank on his friends by claiming that he has a time machine  only to be unpleasantly surprised that the device that Baldrick has actually built following Leonardo da Vincis instructions to the letter except for marking values on the instrument display actually is a working time machine He manages to alter time by He restores history but then has the idea of changing history in his favour In the present day a news report shows the popular King Edmund III and his queen Marion of Sherwood being greeted by the prime minister Baldrick With Baldrick working as his prime minister and Parliament dissolved the Blackadder and Baldrick families have finally triumphed and become rulers of the UK Although not appearing within their own series or oneoff special various other Blackadders have appeared or been alluded to over the course of the series Most prominently is Sir Edmund Blackadder who appears in the Comic Relief special Blackadder The Cavalier Years Set after the English Civil War Sir Edmund is apparently a loyal royalist and friend of Charles I of England played by Stephen Fry This Blackadder also appeared in an introductory sequence for Charles Prince of Wales fiftieth birthday Gala Performance in which he was supposedly organising a birthday show for Charles II also Fry Several relatives of the Blackadder family include the Puritan Whiteadders and the Highlander clan of MacAdder Various oneoff specials have introduced other Blackadders throughout history from the Roman Centurion Blaccadicus to a Grand Admiral Blackadder in the distant future who becomes ruler of the universe At the 2000 Royal Variety Performance Atkinson performed a short monologue as Captain Lord Edmund Blackadder of Her Royal Highnesss Regiment of Shirkers In 2002 during the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II trailers for the Party at the Palace featured the Keeper of Her Majestys Lawn Sprinklers Sir Osmond DarlingBlackadder who was against the idea Sir Osmond also cohosted the lighthearted documentary on the celebrations Jubilee Girl He is notable for being one of the few members of the family not to be named Edmund and also for his double barrelled name suggesting a family connection to Kevin Darling At the 2008 charity event We Are Most Amused Atkinson appeared in a sketch parodying the then current banking crisis as Sir Edmund Blackadder CEO of the Melchett and Darling Bank Blackadder is a genuine surname its usage in the UK currently documented back to the 15th century which may explain the choice of the name with the first series being set in this time period The name is thought to be mostly Scottish in origin which is not contradicted in the series as the first Blackadder begins as the Duke of Edinburgh In the third series it is revealed that a branch of the Blackadder family is a significant clan in Scotland although they have become known by the name MacAdder,0

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws,"In propositional logic and boolean algebra De Morgans laws are a pair of transformation rules that are both valid rules of inference The rules allow the expression of conjunctions and disjunctions purely in terms of each other via negation The rules can be expressed in English as The negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations
The negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations or informally as not A and B is the same as not A or not B 
and also The rules can be expressed in formal language with two propositions P and Q as and where Applications of the rules include simplification of logical expressions in computer programs and digital circuit designs De Morgans laws are an example of a more general concept of mathematical duality   The negation of conjunction rule may be written in sequent notation The negation of disjunction rule may be written as In rule form negation of conjunction and negation of disjunction and expressed as a truthfunctional tautology or theorem of propositional logic where  and  are propositions expressed in some formal system De Morgans laws are normally shown in the compact form above with negation of the output on the left and negation of the inputs on the right A clearer form for substitution can be stated as This emphasizes the need to invert both the inputs and the output as well as change the operator when doing a substitution In set theory and Boolean algebra it is often stated as union and intersection interchange under complementation Nonetheless these laws are helpful in making valid inferences in proofs and deductive arguments De Morgans theorem may be applied to the negation of a disjunction or the negation of a conjunction in all or part of a formula In the case of its application to a disjunction consider the following claim it is false that either of A or B is true which is written as In that it has been established that neither A nor B is true then it must follow that both A is not true and B is not true which may be written directly as If either A or B were true then the disjunction of A and B would be true making its negation false Presented in English this follows the logic that since two things are both false it is also false that either of them is true Working in the opposite direction the second expression asserts that A is false and B is false or equivalently that not A and not B are true Knowing this a disjunction of A and B must be false also The negation of said disjunction must thus be true and the result is identical to the first claim The application of De Morgans theorem to a conjunction is very similar to its application to a disjunction both in form and rationale Consider the following claim it is false that A and B are both true which is written as In order for this claim to be true either or both of A or B must be false for if they both were true then the conjunction of A and B would be true making its negation false Thus one at least or more of A and B must be false or equivalently one or more of not A and not B must be true This may be written directly as Presented in English this follows the logic that since it is false that two things are both true at least one of them must be false Working in the opposite direction again the second expression asserts that at least one of not A and not B must be true or equivalently that at least one of A and B must be false Since at least one of them must be false then their conjunction would likewise be false Negating said conjunction thus results in a true expression and this expression is identical to the first claim The proof that  is done by first proving that  and then by proving that  Let  Then  Because  then either  or  If  then  so then  Otherwise if  then  so  Because this is true for any arbitrary  then  and so  To prove the reverse direction assume that  such that  Then  It follows that  and  Then  and  But then  in contradiction to the hypothesis that  Therefore  and  Because  and  then  concluding the proof of De Morgans law The other De Morgans law that  is proven similarly In extensions of classical propositional logic the duality still holds that is to any logical operator one can always find its dual since in the presence of the identities governing negation one may always introduce an operator that is the De Morgan dual of another This leads to an important property of logics based on classical logic namely the existence of negation normal forms any formula is equivalent to another formula where negations only occur applied to the nonlogical atoms of the formula The existence of negation normal forms drives many applications for example in digital circuit design where it is used to manipulate the types of logic gates and in formal logic where it is a prerequisite for finding the conjunctive normal form and disjunctive normal form of a formula Computer programmers use them to simplify or properly negate complicated logical conditions They are also often useful in computations in elementary probability theory Let one define the dual of any propositional operator Pp q  depending on elementary propositions p q  to be the operator  defined by This idea can be generalised to quantifiers so for example the universal quantifier and existential quantifier are duals To relate these quantifier dualities to the De Morgan laws set up a model with some small number of elements in its domain D such as Then and But using De Morgans laws and verifying the quantifier dualities in the model Then the quantifier dualities can be extended further to modal logic relating the box necessarily and diamond possibly operators In its application to the alethic modalities of possibility and necessity Aristotle observed this case and in the case of normal modal logic the relationship of these modal operators to the quantification can be understood by setting up models using Kripke semantics",0

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosimeter,A radiation dosimeter is a device that measures exposure to ionizing radiation It has two main uses for human radiation protection and for measurement of dose in industrial processes   The personal ionising radiation dosimeter is of fundamental importance in the disciplines of radiation dosimetry and radiation health physics and is primarily used to estimate the radiation dose deposited in an individual wearing the device Ionising radiation damage to the human body is cumulative and is related to the total dose received for which the SI unit is the sievert Workers exposed to radiation such as radiographers nuclear power plant workers doctors using radiotherapy those in laboratories using radionuclides and HAZMAT teams are required to wear dosimeters so a record of occupational exposure can be made Such devices are known as legal dosimeters if they have been approved for use in recording personnel dose for regulatory purposes Dosimeters can be worn to obtain a whole body dose and there are also specialist types that can be worn on the fingers or clipped to headgear to measure the localised body irradiation for specific activities Common types of personal dosimeters for ionizing radiation include The Electronic Personal Dosimeter EPD is an electronic device which has a number of sophisticated functions such as continual monitoring which allows alarm warnings at preset levels and live readout of dose accumulated These are especially useful in high dose areas where residence time of the wearer is limited due to dose constraints The dosimeter can be reset usually after taking a reading for record purposes and thereby reused multiple times Film badge dosimeters are for onetime use only The level of radiation absorption is indicated by a change to the film emulsion which is shown when the film is developed Quartz fiber dosimeters are charged to a high voltage As the gas in the dosimeter chamber becomes ionized by radiation the charge leaks away causing the fiber indicator to change against a graduated scale Manufacturing processes that treat products with ionizing radiation such as food irradiation use dosimeters to calibrate doses deposited in the matter being irradiated These usually must have a greater dose range than personal dosimeters and doses are normally measured in the unit of absorbed dose the gray Gy The dosimeter is located on or adjacent to the items being irradiated during the process as a validation of dose levels received QFD  These are now largely superseded View of QFD reading Russian Sosna radiometerdosimeter Front view Russian Sosna radiometerdosimeter Rear view Russian Radex RD1503 Swiss Dosimeter SA05A,0

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor-compression_desalination,Vapor compression desalination refers to a distillation process where the evaporation of sea or saline water is obtained by the application of heat delivered by compressed vapor Since compression of the vapor increases both the pressure and temperature of the vapor it is possible to use the latent heat rejected during condensation to generate additional vapor The effect of compressing water vapor can be done by two methods The first method utilizes an ejector system motivated by steam at manometric pressure from an external source in order to recycle vapor from the desalination process The form is designated Ejecto or Thermo Compression Using the second method water vapor is compressed by means of a mechanical device electrically driven in most cases This form is designated mechanical vapor compression MVC The MVC process comprises two different versions Vapor Compression VC and Vacuum Vapor Compression VVC VC designates those systems in which the evaporation effect takes place at manometric pressure and VVC the systems in which evaporation takes place at subatmospheric pressures under vacuum The compression is mechanically powered by something such as a compression turbine As vapor is generated it is passed over to a heat exchanging condenser which returns the vapor to water The resulting fresh water is moved to storage while the heat removed during condensation is transmitted to the remaining feedstock The VVC process is the more efficient distillation process available in the market today in terms of energy consumption and water recovery ratio As the system is electrically driven it is considered a clean process it is highly reliable and simple to operate and maintain,0

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Magnus_Sprengtporten,Jacob Magnus Sprengtporten 1727 Finland  2 April 1786 Biskopsudden Stockholm was a Swedish and Finnish officer and politician and halfbrother of Georg Magnus Sprengtporten   In his twelfth year he chose the profession of arms and served his country with distinction The few and miserable triumphs of Sweden during the Seven Years War were due almost entirely to young Sprengtporten and he emerged from it with a lieutenantcolonelcy a pension and the reputation of being the smartest officer in the service Sprengtporten had too hearty a contempt for Hats and Caps the two main political factions during the Age of Liberty 17191772 in Sweden to belong to either He made no secret of his sentiments and soon gathered round him a band of young officers of strong royalist proclivities whom he formed into a club the socalled Svenska Botten Swedens groundwork The club was suppressed by the dominant Caps who also sought to ruin Sprengtporten financially by inciting his tenants in Finland to bring actions against him for alleged extortion not in the ordinary courts but in the Riksdag itself where Sprengtportens political adversaries would be his judges The enraged Finnish colonel thereupon approached Gustav III of Sweden with the project of a revolution against the Caps It was to begin in Finland where Sprengtportens regiment the Nylandia dragoons was stationed He undertook to seize the impregnable fortress of Sveaborg by a coup de main The submission of the whole grand duchy would be the natural consequence of such a success and Finland once secured Sprengtporten proposed at the head of his Finns to embark for Sweden meet the king and his friends near Stockholm and surprise the capital by a night attack This plan subsequently enlarged by a suggestion of a fellow plotter Johan Christopher Toll was warmly approved of by the king On 22 July 1772 Sprengtporten left Stockholm On 9 August he reached Helsingfors On 16 August he persuaded to submit to him fortress of Sveaborg soon followed by that of Helsingfors A week later all Finland was under the colonels control By 23 August Sprengtporten was ready to reembark for Stockholm with 780 men but contrary winds kept him back and in the meantime Gustav III himself had carried out his revolution unaided On his return to Sweden however Sprengtporten was received with the greatest distinction and made a lieutenantgeneral and colonel of the guards He was also appointed the president of a commission for strengthening the defences of Finland But Sprengtporten was still dissatisfied He could never forgive Gustav for having forestalled the revolution and his morbidly irritable and suspicious temper saw slights and insults in the most innocent conjunctures His first quarrel with Gustav happened in 1774 when he refused to accept the post of commanderinchief in Finland on the eve of threatened war with Imperial Russia The king goodnaturedly overlooked his outrageous insolence on this occasion but the inevitable rupture was only postponed A most trumpery affair brought matters to a head Sprengtporten had insulted the guards by giving precedence over them at a courtmartial to some officers of his own dragoons The guards complained to the king who after consulting with the senate mildly remonstrated with Sprengtporten by letter Sprengtporten thereupon tendered his resignation as colonel of the guard and at a personal interview with Gustav was so violent and insolent that anything like agreement between them became impossible Sprengtporten was haunted by the fixed idea that the jeunesse dore of the court was in league with his old enemies to traduce and supplant him and not all the forbearance of the king could open his eyes He received a pension on his retirement and was allowed the extraordinary privilege of a guard of honour as long as he lived Nevertheless to the end of his career he continued to harass and annoy his longsuffering benefactor with fresh impertinences,0

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35ft_6in_Self-righting_motor-class_lifeboat,The 35ft 6in Selfrighting motorclass was a displacement hull lifeboat built in single engine form between 1929 and 1940 and in twin engined form between 1947 and 1950 The boats were operated by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution between 1929 and 1965   The need to provide motor lifeboats at stations using carriage launching had first been addressed with the 35ft Selfrighting motor type of 1921 Three of these boats were built and were to all intents and purposes pulling and sailing boats with an auxiliary engine The definitive boat for production appeared in 1929 six inches longer and with the same 8ft 10in beam as the second and third 35ft types After the first two boats had been put on station a crash programme of production was instituted in 1931 and twelve boats were produced that year These gave many stations their first motor lifeboats but experience proved that stability was lacking and from ON 763 beam was increased by 5 inches The final two single engine boats saw further beam increases to 9ft 6in and 9ft 10in respectively In common with the similar but non selfrighting Liverpoolclass post war production switched to twin engined versions but only five were built The RNLI was increasingly switching to more stable non selfrighting lifeboats and the single engine 35ft 6in Selfrighting motors were replaced at most stations by Liverpool class boats in the early 1950s after only around twenty years service The twin engined boats had even shorter lives being replaced at three stations by Liverpools and at the other two by 37ft Oakleys after less than fifteen years service The challenge of producing a motor lifeboat light enough to be manhandled for carriage launching resulted in a boat weighing around 512 tons The single RNLI designed Weyburn Engineering built AE6 6cyl petrol engine produced 35bhp and sat in a watertight engine room beneath pent roof access hatches ahead of an aft cockpit shelter from which the mechanic operated the engine controls Apart from a small shelter forward the boats were open As decsribed above beam was increased during production in an attempt to improve stability After World War II five twin engined boats were built which had a beam of 10ft and a larger shelter covering the engine room and very similar to the contemporary twin engined Liverpools The first two of these boats were powered by two 18bhp Weyburn AE4 4cylinder petrol engines but the final three had 20bhp Ferry FKR3 3 cylinder diesels,0

Ayyavazhi in Christian reports According to the Ayyavazhi religion the Ayyavazhi Trinity is the incarnation of God in the current stage of world development Kali Yukam Ayya Vaikundar the Incarnation is the combination of the Ultimate God Narayana and Human Being In Akilam immediately after the Incarnation of Vaikundar he was viewed simultaneously as the Ultimate God Narayana and as son of Narayana As per the earlier deed Narayana had to destroy Kaliyan but due to the boons that kaliyan claimed Narayana cannot destroy him And as per the promise made by Kaliyan he would only be destroyed if he give torture to any Pantaram To overcome all these such a unique way of Incarnation was planned Akilam narrates that the Avatar incarnation of Vaikundar is the combination of three dimensions of God and it happens in three stages Note that according to Vedic scriptures FormBody of Vishnu inner spirit of Vishnu and His Holy Names and Lilas are nondifferent   The Soul of Vaikundar is that of the Paramatma or the Ultimate God seeAyya Vaikundar and it was viewed that the Ultimate God or Ekam the God beyond Consciousness incarnates here in the world The Thiru Nadana Ula which was told by Sivan which was a part of Akilam states it clearly An assemblage was rended by getting a great Assemblage which arose with its own intention and by the rended assemblage there formed a great world of righteousness and by which the kali is destroyed as its age is over Here the Great assemblage assembled of the whole which exists in a globular shape represents the Ekam or the Ultimate God which is beyond Consciousness the rended assemblage represents Vaikundar and the world of righteouseness represents Dharma Yukam This verse says that Vaikundar was the one by which Dharma Yukam created and Vaikundar was rended by getting the power of Ekam without which kali would not be destroyed Immediately after the ceremony of avatar of Vaikundar Narayana called Vaikundar Your self is Sivan your self is Vethan your self is Thirumal and your self is the austerity your self is Brahman and your self is the whole which exists Vaikundar was also called as Muthalvan which in Tamil means the one who formed first Also as per the boons that Kaliyan claimed Narayana or any other else could not destroy Kaliyan This is also the reason which paves the way for the soul of the Ultimate Being to come as Vaikundar During the Katuvai Sothanai Vaikundar says that Iam the one who created the Ekam and Iam in every thing which exists Since the trimurti was concealed into my self myself is the soul of all living beings And also in the event of the Marriage of the Deities Vaikundar unified into himself Sarasvathi Laksmi and also Parvathi and in addition the Goddess of Earth Poomadanthai and by which it was clearly stated that Vaikundar is the incarnation of Ekam The Ultimate which is beyond all these The spirit of Narayana was in which the Ultimate soul is installed So on the other hand Vaikundar was viewed as Narayana the Murthi Stage ie the God with supreme consciousness A verse in Akilam states that The day on which Narayanar came as Vaikundar Also as soon as the Santror was born seeSantror Pirappu the Seven Virgins felt that they had lost their purity They tried to assemble the Ganges water in the shape of a ball but they cannot They not even look the face of their sons They started performing austerity that Narayana who was the one who deceived them should marry them and rule the world along with them This was accepted by Thirumal And for this reason Vaikundar marry the Seven Virgins during his Avatar This is the part at which Ayya Vikundar is highly focused as Narayana in Akilam Also when Kroni was fragmented into six Sivan told with Narayana  All the six fragments will take birth as Asuras in each Yukams and you have the responsibility to destroy him by taking birth in world This is greatly described in Akilam One Then Akilam says that in the Dharma Yukam Vaikundar rule the world along with the Seven Virgins and Santror Makkal Accordingly it was stated that Vaikundar is Narayana himself who incarnated According to Akilam the Spirit of Narayana and the Soul of Ekam collectively installed into the body of a human born to Ponnu Nadar and Veilal And for an Incarnation the body is of equal importance as the Soul and Spirit Akilam narrates it as Satam Pirakka Lokam Thattu miga Maari At the very moment the body took birth the situation of the whole world changed By considering the Soul Vaikundar was called as Ekam by considering the Spirit he was called Narayana As so by considering the body he was called as Son by Narayana Because the body take birth in the lineage of Santror who were the children of Narayana And Vinchai is the part where this view could be ultimately found Both in the First as well as the Muttappathi Vinchais Ayya Vaikundar was called by Narayana with a high fatherly affection And also Vaikundar called Narayana as Father In this fact it is nottable that before the incarnation iebefore the soul of Ekam and spirit of Narayana installed into the body Narayana in the sea called the body as My dear son because the body was

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_Genesis,Theatre Genesis was an OffOffBroadway theater founded in 1964 by Ralph Cook Located in the historic St Marks Church intheBowery in New York City it produced the work of new American playwrights including Lanford Wilson Murray Mednick Leonard Melfi Walter Hadler and most notably Sam Shepard It is regarded as one of four theaters responsible for the explosion of New Yorks offoffBroadway movement along with Joe Cinos Caffe Cino Judson Poets Theatre and La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club Known for its anarchistic heterosexual and machismo energy Theatre Genesis produced gritty and political plays that often attracted the postBeat Generation street poets of the 1960s Between the volatile and socially charged environment of New York Citys East Village and the rejection of the citys offBroadway commercial producing model writers and actors flocked to Theatre Genesis to create an extremely fertile and experimental period in American playwriting   Theatre Genesis finding a home in a church may seem an odd partnership if it werent for a forwardthinking young rector named Michael Allen The progressive Episcopalian took the helm of the church in 1963 and quickly opened his parish to all of the neighborhoods constituents mounting a largescale outreach effort to include all demographics and all ethnicities from the surrounding streets At that time the east village was a melange of artists young counterculturists emigrates from more expensive Manhattan neighborhoods as well as the homeless Allens mission was to fund the arts and education initiatives in order to make its programming a microcosm of the neighborhood outside the church Unlike its counterpart Judson Church in the west village St Marks Church intheBowery had less initial resistance from its older wealthier and therefore more conservative members and Allens arts programming quickly amplified the restless voice of a neighborhood What resulted was an artistic questioning of New Yorks and the countrys status quo Plays poetry readings underground films and political gatherings all started occurring on church premises with the help and blessing of Rector Allen but it soon became clear an arts curate would need to be hired in order to spearhead Allens vision of arts integration After a shortlived first arts curate named Tom Pike Allen serendipitously met Ralph Cook an actor who had stumbled into a Sunday service to listen to Allens sermon Cook was so moved by the Rectors presence that he returned week after week and the two men struck up a friendship Being wellconnected socially in the downtown arts scene Cooks many friends  including Sam Shepard  were already poised looking for a theater to showcase their emerging talent and insatiable creativity Steeped in the jazz and poetry scene below 14th street Cook rubbed shoulders with the more languagebased playwrights who wrote in the unpredictable rhythms of New York City street life In addition to Shepard writers like Murray Mednick Leonard Melfi and Tom Sankey were frustrated young artists writing from a place of isolation and alienation from the political and social maelstrom around them Their work was angstdriven and testosteronefueled which fit less in Caffe Cinos and La MaMa Experimental Theatre Clubs more loose structure and perceived camp aesthetic In an intimate 70seat blackbox with sixteen lights and nine dimmers spare sets minimal props and a focus on harddriving language and nihilistic themes Theatre Genesis became a sharpedged testing ground for new work As the newly appointed lay minister of the arts Ralph Cook soon began the sixyearlong routine of reading scripts He read incessantly and soon instigated a more diligent and thorough selection process than any other offoffBroadway theater of the time He created a twopronged production track a selfselected season of up to six new plays and then a Monday night workshop series where writers could hear their work aloud for the first time Cook believed it was his job to give a large degree of exposure and continuity to writers early in their career in order to develop the artist instead of just the play Despite his nurturing of individual artists and their potential Cook never commissioned work or guaranteed a future production instead basing his programming decisions purely on his opinion of each play While this often led Genesis playwrights to be produced elsewhere it developed a great deal of trust in Cook to be honest and objective in his programming which created a closeness and camaraderie with the playwrights who frequented there After an initial offkey production of the didactic Study in Color by Michael Boyd Cook produced a doublebill of one acts by his friend and recent coworker Sam Shepard Cowboys and The Rock Garden were homages to the writing of Samuel Beckett and reflected Shepards aimless wanderings both physical and psychological with then comrade Charles Mingus III son of the jazz legend Charles Mingus The plays harnessed a youthful energy of playful language but were also a representation of a raw voicea voice from the streets Cooks decision to supporting Shepard was an instinct that would launch the career of the most celebrated child of offoffBroadway while setting a tone for Theatre Genesis works to come Shepard describes the energy behind mounting those first productions We were in rehearsal for  Activism downtown was still in full force but with the death of Joe Cino in 1970 the rare breed of offoffBroadway experimental theater was moving out of the coffeehouses and into other venues Coordinates 404350N 735915W  407305N 739874W  407305 739874,0

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Egypt,The culture of Egypt has thousands of years of recorded history Ancient Egypt was among the earliest civilizations For millennia Egypt maintained a strikingly complex and stable culture that influenced later cultures of Europe the Middle East and Africa After the Pharaonic era Egypt itself came under the influence of Hellenism for a time Christianity and later Islamic culture   The Egyptian language which formed a separate branch among the family of AfroAsiatic languages was among the first written languages and is known from the hieroglyphic inscriptions preserved on monuments and sheets of papyrus The Coptic language the last stage of Egyptian is today the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church Hieroglyphs were written on peoples front doors so that the news of the pharaoh would travel to everyone The Koin dialect of the Greek language was important in Hellenistic Alexandria and was used in the philosophy and science of that culture and was later studied by Arabic scholars Arabic came to Egypt in the 7th century  Egyptian music is a rich mixture of indigenous Egyptian African and Western influences As early as 4000 BC ancient Egyptians were playing harps and flutes as well as two indigenous instruments the ney and the oud However there is little notation of Egyptian music before the 7th century AD when Egypt became part of the Muslim world Percussion and vocal music became important at this time and has remained an important part of Egyptian music today Contemporary Egyptian music traces its beginnings to the creative work of luminaries such as Abdul Hamuli Almaz Sayed Mikkawi and Mahmud Osman who were all patronized by Khedive Ismail and who influenced the later work of Sayed Darwish Umm Kulthum Mohammed Abdel Wahab Abdel Halim Hafez and other Egyptian music giants From the 1970s onwards Egyptian pop music has become increasingly important in Egyptian culture particularly among the large youth population of Egypt Egyptian folk music is also popular played during weddings and other festivities In the last quarter of the 20th century Egyptian music was a way to communicate social and class issues The most popular Egyptian pop singers are Amr Diab Tamer Hosny Mohamed Mounir and Ali El Haggar Belly dance or Raqs Sharqi literally oriental dancing may have originated in Egypt and today the country is considered the international center of the art Egyptian cuisine consists of local culinary traditions such as Ful medames Kushari and Molokhia It also shares similarities with food found throughout the eastern Mediterranean like kebab and falafel,0

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_problem,The horizon problem is a problem with the standard cosmological model of the Big Bang which was identified in the late 1960s primarily by Charles Misner It points out that different regions of the universe have not contacted each other because of the great distances between them but nevertheless they have the same temperature and other physical properties This should not be possible given that the transfer of information or energy heat etc can occur at most at the speed of light One solution to the horizon problem is the theory of cosmic inflation   When one looks out into the night sky distances also correspond to time into the past A galaxy measured at ten billion light years in distance appears to us as it was ten billion years ago because the light has taken that long to travel to the viewer If one were to look at a galaxy ten billion light years away in one direction say west and another in the opposite direction east the total distance between them is twenty billion light years This means that the light from the first has not yet reached the second because the 138 billion years that the universe has existed simply is not a long enough time to allow it to occur In a more general sense there are portions of the universe that are visible to us but invisible to each other outside each others respective particle horizons In standard physical theories no information can travel faster than the speed of light In this context information means any sort of physical interaction For instance heat will naturally flow from a hotter area to a cooler one and in physics terms this is one example of information exchange Given the example above the two galaxies in question cannot have shared any sort of information they are not in causal contact One would expect then that their physical properties would be different and more generally that the universe as a whole would have varying properties in different areas Contrary to this expectation the universe is in fact extremely isotropic which also implies homogeneity The cosmic microwave background radiation CMB which fills the universe is almost precisely the same temperature everywhere in the sky about 2728 + 0004 K The differences in temperature are so slight that it has only recently become possible to develop instruments capable of making the required measurements This presents a serious problem if the universe had started with even slightly different temperatures in different areas then there would simply be no way it could have evened itself out to a common temperature by this point in time According to the Big Bang model as the density of the universe dropped while it expanded it eventually reached a point where photons in the mix of particles were no longer immediately impacting matter they decoupled from the plasma and spread out into the universe as a burst of light This is thought to have occurred about 300000 years after the Big Bang The volume of any possible information exchange at that time was 900000 light years across using the speed of light and the rate of expansion of space in the early universe Instead the entire sky has the same temperature a volume 1088 times larger The theory of cosmic inflation provides one solution to the problem along with several others such as the flatness problem by postulating a short 1032 second period of exponential expansion dubbed inflation in the first seconds of the history of the universe During inflation the universe would have increased in size by an enormous factor Prior to the inflation the entire universe was small and causally connected it was during this period that the physical properties evened out Inflation then expanded the universe rapidly locking in the uniformity at large distances One consequence of cosmic inflation is that the anisotropies in the Big Bang are reduced but not entirely eliminated Differences in the temperature of the cosmic background are smoothed by cosmic inflation but they still exist The theory predicts a spectrum for the anisotropies in the microwave background which is mostly consistent with observations from WMAP and COBE,0

the comparative comfort of Scotland deeply moral and ordained to the Christian ministry each one of them educated in one of the five ancient universities of their country They worked largely without

student on 5 May 1893 The early history of Murray College is both interesting and singular The Foreign Committee of the Church of Scotland was requested in 1883 to open a college in Lahore It turned down not only the request of the Punjab Govt but even an attractive offer of pounds 25000000 as financial aid by one Sardar Sarwat Singh for the said purpose The said Foreign Committee at that stage perhaps could not even dream that destiny had turned the scale in favour of the people of Sialkot In 1889 the Punjab Government again approached the said Foreign Committee to open a college at Sialkot The Lt Governor of the Punjab even earmarked a financial grant for the purpose Consequently in 1889 the Intermediate section of the College was started in school itself For 20 years classes were met in the same building and by almost the same four members incidentally representing all the major communities of the undivided India Maulvi Mir Hassan Sahib Mr Narinjin Das and Sardar Harnam Singh They

Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_generator,A sound generator is a vibrating object which produces a sound There are two main kinds of sound generators thus two main kinds of musical instruments A full cycle of a sound wave will be described in each example which consists of initial normal conditions no fluctuations in atmospheric pressure an increase of air pressure a subsequent decrease in air pressure which brings it back to normal a decrease in air pressure less pressure than initial conditions and lastly an increase which brings atmospheric pressure back to normal again Therefore the final conditions are the same as the initial atrest conditions The first kind is simple and is called the vibrating or oscillating piston At the beginning of the cycle sound pressure is normal Then an opening called an aperture such as the opening on the mouthpiece of a trumpet is partially open and a short stream of air under pressure is released In the second step of a full cycle the valve is completely open and pressure is at a maximum In the third cycle the valve is partially closed and the pressure has decreased from the maximum value Then the valve is closed and the pressure is the same as normal undisturbed atmospheric pressure Thus a full cycle is produced This happens very quickly in the vibration of lips ie the aforementioned valve as they quickly open and close or vibrate More examples of this type of sound instrument include sirens organs saxophones and trombones,0
