        "' Editors note Smart Business explores the ways companies are thinking smart to thrive in our digitized world  CNN  In the narrow winding lanes of Old Delhi the knotted masses of electrical wiring hanging across the streets are sometimes so thickly entwined they blot out the sun In the streets of Bangkok electricity wires loop and run in chaotic bundles from concrete power poles In the slums of Mumbai to the townships of South Africa electricity infrastructure is a triumph of make and mend For power utilities in emerging markets collecting the bills from this tangled skein of wiring is a nightmare and slow payment  even outright energy theft  remains a powerful disincentive for new investment in the sector Smart solutions One company however says smart meters may hold the answers to the power problems of the worlds emerging markets While smart meters have been in use in the United States and Europe for more than a decade in markets such as Africa they are set to encourage muchneeded investment in the sector The devices not only record electricity consumption but relay information back to the utility for monitoring and billing purposes Critically they also require prepayment which means that utilities that produce the power can be sure they will be paid for it Alain Bollack director at the Global Power  Utilities Centre of Ernst and Young said the company worked with the city of Tshwane outside Johannesburg in South Africa to install prepaid smart meters to solve endemic problems of late payment longterm debtors and electricity theft The city had two major problems Bollack told CNN The first was they couldnt collect the cash from customers  either businesses or individuals They had 800000 customers that were an average 500 days in arrears The second was that a lot of clients were stealing electricity and thats very common in emerging markets Chaotic infrastructure He said the chaotic nature of the electricity infrastructure in places like Africa or India means that stealing energy is easy Often its as easy as hooking onto a line bypassing the meter and getting free energy The first major problem of energy in emerging markets is getting access to it i the first place the second problem is that when there is access it gets stolen He said cities such as Mumbai had worked hard over the past 10 years to reduce the opportunity for consumers to steal electricity Over ten years ago some 65 of the energy produced in Mumbai was not paid for Bollack said Smart meters he said require customers to pay before they consume and also relay information back to the utilities if the meters are tampered with in any way Legislation is key So far some 3000 smart meters have been rolled out in Tshwane particularly among high consumers of energy At the core of the solution however is legislation and Bollack said that the city government passed laws to enforce the new rule That might not be very pleasant for many consumers but at the end of the day if you provide a service its quite normal to pay for it Bollack said If you have asked nicely for many many years and people still wont pay then you have a right to enforce that by law He said the value proposition extended to consumers in that they also gained a better picture through smart metering of what and how they consumed electricity Ultimately however energy theft is not a sustainable business model leading to underinvestment more costly production and higher prices Bollack said that Tshwanes foray into smart meters was now being viewed with interest from countries throughout the region including Ghana Zimbabwe Mozambique and parts of Nigeria They are looking at it as a possible way of resolving the financing problem of energy infrastructure in Africa Bollack said If you are lucky if youve got investors from China or the US or Europe who are happy to put billions on the table but dont have any guarantee of return on investment Holy grail He said that smart meters in Africa are fast becoming the holy grail for energy sector investors and ultimately could accelerate investment that would provide power for millions more people in the region While critics might argue that consumers have gone from free albeit stolen electricity to electricity they now cant afford Bollack said smart meters for the first time could reverse the vicious circle created by energy theft The business case for the city of Tshwane is interesting he said Energy is one of the citys main sources of revenue and what they are saying is that smart meters are not being introduced to balance the books but to collect the cash to reinvest it into the community Even though theres a lag between when you collect the cash and reinvest what you ultimately create is a virtuous circle Read this Is this the end of the 95 working day Read this Driverless vehicles The end of the road for the trucker '"

She just moved from a top job at Google in Silicon Valley, where she was vice president of Google X, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/09/04/president-obama-names-megan-smith-us-cto-alexander-macgillivray-deputy-us-cto\">to the White House</a>, where\\'s she\\'s now the country\\'s chief technology officer. She\\'s so new to the halls of the White House complex that she\\'s wearing a temporary badge.</p>   <p>\"I just have to fill out all my security clearance forms. I\\'m almost done,\" she says.</p>   <p>Smith started only two months ago as U.S. chief technology officer, a role created at the start of President Obama\\'s administration. The CTO\\'s charge is to find ways to unleash technology to improve government, and federal government is notoriously slow to change.</p>   <p>But just by coming to work in Washington, Smith is already making one change: Her look. At Google, she would be wearing jeans. In the White House, it\\'s a little more buttoned up.</p>   <p>\"Yes, I\\'m wearing a suit. It\\'s comfortable. It\\'s from J.Crew,\" she says.</p>   <p>Smith doesn\\'t actually like talking about external image much, as she\\'s been focused on changing tech from the inside \\u2014 pushing for more women in science and technology fields and keeping them there. We caught up with the mother-of-two as she kicked off a documentary screening for Washington, D.C.-area middle and high-schoolers.</p>   <div id=\"res361159004\" class=\"bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col \">            <div class=\"bucket img\">                  <a id=\"featuredStackSquareImage177622347\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/series/177622347/the-changing-lives-of-women\"  data-metrics=\\'{\"category\":\"Story to Story\",\"action\":\"Click Internal Link\",\"label\":\"http:\\\\/\\\\/www.npr.org\\\\/series\\\\/177622347\\\\/the-changing-lives-of-women\"}\\' ><img src=\"http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2014/10/03/singleladies-v51_sq-4cb9ce392808e2ed169b8ed0cc714efcd7f0ce6b-s11.jpg\" class=\"img90\" title=\"All the single ladies\" alt=\"All the single ladies\" /></a>         <div class=\"bucketblock\">                        <h3><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/series/177622347/the-changing-lives-of-women\"  data-metrics=\\'{\"category\":\"Story to Story\",\"action\":\"Click Internal Link\",\"label\":\"http:\\\\/\\\\/www.npr.org\\\\/series\\\\/177622347\\\\/the-changing-lives-of-women\"}\\' > The Changing Lives Of Women</a></h3>         </div>         <!-- END CLASS=\"BUCKETBLOCK\" -->      </div>      <!-- END CLASS=\"BUCKET IMG\" -->   </div>   <!-- END ID=\"RES361159004\" CLASS=\"BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL \" -->   <p>\"It will be interesting for you guys to see the media talk about the women scientists versus the men scientists, how they hyper-focused on what they looked [like], what they wore,\" Smith said to a roomful of about 70 school kids. \"All this sort of gender bias \\u2014 I want you guys to notice that and observe that, because it\\'s an important thing.\"</p>   <p>The topic of <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/tags/221437017/women-in-tech\">women in tech</a> is on many minds lately.

She bounces when she walks. Her eyes twinkle when she talks about old tech projects and her love of science, which dates back to her childhood.</p>   <p>\"I went to an inner-city school in Buffalo. We had no money, but the teachers were really motivated. They made science fair mandatory. And I think that was one of the key things for all the kids. Many kids went on the STEM related careers because as kids we got to try it. It got me to learn that it was fun, it mattered,\" she says.</p>   <p>She took that thinking with her to MIT.

        "u'BANGKOK \\u2014 One of the founders of popular file-sharing website The Pirate Bay has been arrested under an Interpol warrant as he was crossing into Thailand from Laos, police said Tuesday.\\nHans Fredrik Lennart Neij, who uses the alias TiAMO, was detained Monday by Thai immigration police at a checkpoint in Thailand\\'s Nong Khai province, about 310 miles northeast of Bangkok.\\nNeij, along with other Pirate Bay co-founders, was convicted of aiding copyright infringement by a court in Sweden in 2009. He fled the country after being released on bail.\\nRegional Immigration Police Commissioner Maj. Gen. Chartchai Eimsaeng said a U.S.-based movie association had hired a Thai lawyer to search for Neij, and his photo had been given to immigration police in Nong Khai.\\nThe U.S. movie and music industries have for years pursued strong legal action against sites such as The Pirate Bay, which they say aid the illegal distribution of copyrighted material, depriving its makers of profits due them.\\n\"It might have been a coincidence, but he was wearing the same gray T-shirt that was in the photo. The immigration police officer who spotted him in the car recognized him, so he pulled his car over,\" Chartchai told The Associated Press by phone.\\nChartchai said the 36-year-old Swede had lived in Laos since 2012 and traveled nearly 30 times to Thailand, where he has a house on the resort island of Phuket and 5 million baht ($153,000) in a savings account. Neij\\'s wife was in the car with him. He was being sent to Bangkok later Tuesday and was expected to be returned to Sweden, the police officer said.\\nJonas Nilsson, Neij\\'s lawyer in Sweden, said his client had called him Monday and told him Thai authorities had said \"he would be transported to Sweden.\" However, Nilsson said no decision had been made about a possible extradition.\\nNeij is the second Pirate Bay founder to be arrested in Southeast Asia after a Swedish court in 2009 gave him and three Pirate Bay associates one-year sentences for copyright violation. They also were ordered to pay 46 million kronor ($6.5 million) in damages to the entertainment industry. Their appeals were denied by Sweden\\'s high court.\\nGottfrid Svartholm Warg, who used the alias \"Anakata\" on the Internet, was arrested in Cambodia in 2012 and sent back to Sweden after an international arrest warrant was issued against him.\\nSvartholm Warg served his sentence for copyright infringement before he was extradited to neighboring Denmark, where he faced prosecution for hacking. On Friday, a Danish court sentenced him to 3\\xbd years in prison after he was found guilty of hacking into a private company handling sensitive information for Danish authorities.\\nAssociated Press writer Jan M. Olsen in Copenhagen contributed to this story.\\n'"

        "'When the antidrug educator Tim Ryan talks to students, he often asks them what they know about marijuana. Its a plant, is a common response.But more recently, the answer has changed. Now they reply, Its legal in Colorado.These are confusing times for middle and high school students, who for most of their young lives have been lectured about the perils of substance abuse, particularly marijuana. Now it seems that the adults in their lives have done an about-face.Recreational marijuana is legal in Colorado and in Washington, and many other states have approved it for medical use. Lawmakers, the news media and even parents are debating the merits of full-scale legalization.They are growing up in a generation where marijuana used to be bad, and maybe now its not bad, said Mr. Ryan, a senior prevention specialist with FCD Educational Services, an antidrug group that works with students in the classroom.Their parents are telling them not to do it, but they may be supporting legalization of it at the same time.Antidrug advocates say efforts to legalize marijuana have created new challenges as they work to educate teenagers and their parents about the unique risks that alcohol, marijuana and other drugs pose to the developing teenage brain.These educators say their goal is not to vilify marijuana or take a stand on legalization; instead, they say their role is to convince young people and their parents that the use of drugs is not just a moral or legal issue, but a significant health issue.The health risks are real, said Steve Pasierb, the chief executive of the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids. Every passing year, science unearths more health risks about why any form of substance use is unhealthy for young people.Already nearly half of teenagers  44 percent  have tried marijuana at least once, according to data from the partnership. Regular use is less common. One in four teenagers report using marijuana in the past month, and 7 percent report frequent use  at least 20 times in the past month.Even in the states where marijuana is legal, it remains, like alcohol, off-limits to anyone younger than 21. But the reality is that once a product becomes legal, it becomes much easier for underage users to obtain it.This summer, the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids released its annual tracking study, in which young people were asked what stopped them from trying drugs. Getting into trouble with the law and disappointing their parents were cited as the two most common reason young people did not use marijuana. The concern now is that legalization will remove an important mental barrier that keeps adolescents from trying marijuana at a young age.Making it legal makes it much more accessible, more available, said Dr. Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. This is the reality, so what we need to do is to prevent the damage or at least minimize it as much as possible.Drug prevention experts say the Just Say No approach of the 1980s does not work. The goal of parents should not be to prevent their kids from ever trying marijuana.Instead, the focus should be on practical reasons to delay use of any mind-altering substance, including alcohol, until they are older.The reason is that young brains continue to develop until the early 20s, and young people who start using alcohol or marijuana in their teens are far more vulnerable to long-term substance-abuse problems.The brain is still wiring itself during adolescence, and marijuana  or any drug use  during this period essentially trains the reward system to embrace a mind-altering chemical.We know that 90 percent of adults who are addicted began use in teenage years, Mr. Pasierb said. They programmed the reward and drive center of their teenage brain that this is one of those things that rewards and drives me like food does, like sex does.Studies in New Zealand and Canada have found that marijuana use in the teenage years can result in lost I.Q. points. Mr. Pasierb says the current generation of young people are high achievers and are interested in the scientific evidence about how substance use can affect intelligence.You have to focus on brain maturation, he said. This generation of kids wants good brains; they want to get into better schools. Talk to a junior or senior about whether marijuana use shaves a couple points off their SATs, and they will listen to you.Because early exposure to marijuana can change the trajectory of brain development, even a few years of delaying use in the teen years is better. Research shows that young adults who smoked pot regularly before the age of 16 performed significantly worse on cognitive function tests than those who started smoking in their later teenage years.Drug educators say that one benefit of the legalization talk is that it may lead to more research on the health effects of marijuana on young people and more funding for antidrug campaigns.The Partnership for Drug-Free Kids plans to continue its Above the Influence marketing campaign, which studies show has been an effective way of reaching teenagers about the risks of drug use. The campaign does not target a specific drug, but it teaches parents and teens about the health effects of early drug use and tries to empower teens to make good choices.Legalization is going to make the work we do even more relevant, Mr. Pasierb said. Its part of the changing drug landscape.'"
