        "' Sen  John Barrasso  R Wyo  is so troubled by the Affordable Care Act s recent successes that he s gone into denial  Confronted with evidence of an enrollment surge  the Republican senator argued on national television yesterday that he believes White House officials are  cooking the books  to make it appear as if consumers are signing up for health insurance    In reality  of course  there s nothing to suggest the Obama administration is perpetrating a massive fraud  But if we re going to talk about the health care debate and cooking the books  we should pause to appreciate the above work of art Fox News aired this morning  as reported by Samantha Wyatt    It s tough to know where to start  exactly  First  Fox clearly manipulated the axes  to a comical degree  in the hopes of making some kind of ideological point  Second  it s not clear why Fox relied on March 27 for the left column  since enrollment has grown considerably since    Third  to characterize the 7 million total as the  goal  is itself misleading   the Obama administration never announced a specific enrollment goal for the open enrollment period  Rather  the figure was a projection from the Congressional Budget Office  which actually dropped to 6 million late last year    So  if Fox News was going to do this chart correctly  what would it look like    This is my attempt to recreate Fox s image without the political slant  but remember  even this doesn t tell the public much  The left column is out of date   rumor has it  the ACA is going to get pretty darn close to 7 million   and the right column isn t really a  goal  so much as a projection    But let s not miss the forest for the trees  Fox News felt the need to put that ridiculous chart on the air because reality is starting to look pretty good for the Affordable Care Act  If the facts were on ACA opponents  side  there wouldn t have been any need to manipulate the axes in the first place    The larger takeaway  then  is that we re poised to experience a very different kind of debate than the one we ve been stuck in for the last several months  Since the fall  the question has been   Is Obamacare failing  The new question is   Does the Obamacare good news count as a proper success    For the right  this shift is itself something of a disaster  Conservatives aren t just having to root for failure  but they re simultaneously stuck pretending good news is bad news    '"

        "' washingtonpost.com  1996-2014 The Washington Post  Help and Contact Us Terms of Service Privacy Policy Submissions and Discussion Policy RSS Terms of Service Ad Choices Its fair to say that Bob Marley probably could not have imagined that 33 years after his death, his name would be lent to what is about to be the newest entrant to the burgeoning legal marijuana market. The reggae icon was perhaps the most prominent and outspoken advocate of the drug throughout his life and at the height of his fame. He viewed it as a spiritual and creative force that was probably more likely to be legalized by  Christs government than governments here on Earth. But times have changed  in a big way. Look no further than Tuesdays announcement by Marleys family that it plans to piggyback on successful efforts to legalize marijuana in the United States and elsewhere by introducing a new brand of marijuana products bearing the late singers name. Marley Natural is being launched by Privateer Holdings, a cannabis industry investment firm, and products will reach the market in late 2015. My dad would be so happy to see people understanding the healing power of the herb, Marleys daughter Cedella Marley said in a news release. He viewed the herb as something spiritual that could awaken our well-being, deepen our reflection, connect us to nature and liberate our creativity. Marley Natural is an authentic way to honor his legacy by adding his voice to the conversation about cannabis and helping end the social harms caused by prohibition, she added. It will offer organically grown heirloom Jamaican marijuana strains, in keeping with Marleys preference for high-quality marijuana grown without the use of fertilizer. And it will be available in jurisdictions that allow recreational or medicinal marijuana sales. The brand also plans to offer cannabis- and hemp-infused products such as lotions and sun-repair creams. Marley reportedly smoked as much as a pound of marijuana per week. But at the time of his intense fame in the United States and around the world, he was viewed as a nonconformist symbol. Marley has become even more of a global icon and brand in the years since his death, but that its now happening in a world in which marijuana is decriminalized in some places is something even he didnt foresee. Legalize herb? Boy, I jus don know. Its kinda legalized already, he noted in a 1976 interview with High Times. He was referring to the widespread use and cultivation of marijuana in Jamaica, where the drug has actually been illegal for over 100 years. And change is coming there, too. In late September, the Jamaican government announced that it is considering support for a proposal to decriminalize possession of small amounts of what Marley and Rastafarians called the holy herb if it is being used for medicinal, and eventually, religious purposes. That is a direct result of the loosening of legalization laws in some U.S. states though marijuana remains an illegal schedule I substance under Federal law.  Over the years, critics of harsh marijuana laws have argued that the penalties have done little to stamp out organized crime associated with the trafficking of black market drugs, including marijuana, through the island. And of course, there is potentially huge financial upside, as the investment firm Privateer Holdings has sought to demonstrate with its recent business ventures in the marijuana space. The time has come to provide an opportunity for Jamaicans to benefit from the marijuana industry, said Kingstons mayor Angela Brown Burke recently, according to the Associated Press.  According to a release, the brand will have an unspecified philanthropic component to ensure that families and communities who have been harmed by prohibition have the opportunity to benefit from the new, legal cannabis economy, the companys announcement said. My husband believed the herb was a natural and positive part of life and he felt it was important to the world, Marleys wife Rita said in a statement. He looked forward to this day.

        "['Register now for free, or sign in with any of these services: City officials seeking to levy local taxes on legal sales of marijuana in Oregon plan to take their fight to the state Legislature next year. The League of Oregon Cities says it will ask legislators to amend the marijuana legalization measure passed by voters two weeks ago to explicitly allow local taxes being sought by at least 70 cities, including Portland and several of its suburban neighbors. Sponsors of Measure 91 say they will fight the local taxes, which they argue could drive up the cost of legal marijuana to the point that it could encourage pot users to continue buying on the black market. The fight over marijuana taxation is one of several thorny issues the Legislature may face next year following the passage of Measure 91. Legislative leaders are considering establishing a special Senate-House committee to consider the regulatory and tax issues swirling around the coming of legal marijuana to Oregon. \"People are going to make all sorts of jokes about having a joint committee,\" said Rep. Peter Buckley, D-Ashland, the House budget chief. \"But I think its the most efficient way to get some of these issues worked out.\" Aides to both Senate President Peter Courtney, D-Salem, and House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland, said they are considering requests from several legislators  to establish a special marijuana committee. \"Thats definitely something she is receptive to,\" said Koteks spokesman, Jared Mason-Gere. \"She thinks it is pretty important that the implementation of 91 is done properly.\" In addition to the fight over local taxation, legislators may also be asked to decide: Scott Winkels, a lobbyist for the League of Oregon Cities, said that while Measure 91 allocates some state marijuana taxes to local governments, it wont be enough for them to reimburse the costs of regulating legal marijuana. \"Nobodys going to call the state of Oregon if [marijuana] smoke is drifting into their yard from a neighbors house,\" said Winkels, arguing that cities have also long claimed that alcohol tax revenues from the state dont cover their costs. Anthony Johnson, the chief sponsor of Measure 91, said that, if anything, the Legislature needs to make it crystal clear that the taxes approved by so many Oregon cities shouldnt be allowed to stand. \"By discouraging retail sales\" with high taxes, \"youre then encouraging black-market sales,\" said Johnson. Under Measure 91, producers will be taxed $35 an ounce for the most potent parts of a marijuana plant, $10 an ounce for leaves and $5 for plant starts sold to home growers. The tax rate was deliberately set lower than in Washington to better compete with the black market, Johnson said. Most of the cities that have approved local taxes opted for a 10 percent sales tax, according to a tally from the League of Oregon Cities. One city, Fairview, approved a 40 percent sales tax with the aim of discouraging retailers from locating there. Sen. Floyd Prozanski, D-Eugene, said he thinks city officials for the most part know that Measure 91 is clear in outlawing local taxes.  Instead, he said,  \"theyre trying to position themselves to come into the Legislature in 2015 and say, Hey let us do it.\" The league of cities also wants the Legislature to change the way localities are allowed to prohibit retail sales. Now, the November 2016 general election is the first in which voters could ban retail sales in their city or county. That has upset some city officials, who note that the OLCC could start handing out retail licenses as early as January of that year. Winkels said this sets up a scenario in which a city could face liability for shutting down an existing business. At a minimum, hed like to allow earlier elections. Ideally, he said, city and county governing boards should be able to make the decision. Dave Kopilak, a Portland lawyer who drafted Measure 91, said retailers would be hesitant to open up a business in a community if they knew there was strong political support for banning retail sales. He said sponsors wanted to restrict votes on retail bans to general elections to ensure that it attracted a strong voter turnout. Kopilak said he didnt think city or county officials should be able to act on their own to ban marijuana sales. After all, he said, only the voters can decide to ban local sales of alcohol. -- Jeff Mapes iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps   Twitter |\\r \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFacebook |\\r \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGoogle+ | \\r \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPinterest | \\r \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tInstagram | \\r \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTumblr  Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy  2014 Oregon Live LLC.

Commissioners unanimously approving yesterday a 50% marijuana tax following the passage of Measure 91. That measure, which begins in July, allows the use and sale of marijuana in Oregon for people 21 or older. Despite passing the tax on pot, the question the courts will have to answer is how long will it last. Measure 91 prohibits local governments from taxing marijuana.During the 2012 Election, I highlighted a company in Portland, Oregon that came out publicly in support of Measure 80 which would have legalized marijuana. The company was\\xa0Tom Dwyer Automotive Services. They still support marijuana reform to this day, and now that marijuana has been legalized in Oregon, I want to remind readers from Portland that if they need to get their car worked on, make sure to support\\xa0Tom Dwyer Automotive Services because after all, they supported you during the 2012 and 2014 Elections! According to Google Analytics, over a quarter million people from Portland have visited this blog (doesn\\u2019t include surrounding areas) and I want to encourage each and every one of them to visit Tom Dwyer Automotive Services.

Share Photo \\n                        Bob Marley, who died in 1981, is now playing a key role in a new global line of marijuana products. EFE/Archivo\\n                         More than 33 years after he died of cancer, Jamaican reggae music legend Bob Marley is getting ready to stir things up posthumously , if not lively up the surging commercial marijuana market, as the name and face of what is being billed as the world\\'s first international marijuana brand. Marley Natural, which is described as \"heirloom Jamaican cannabis strains,\\u201d is targeted to ship before the end of 2015 to sales outlets in countries where pot is legal. To help ensure a big roll-out, Marley Natural products will be packaged and marketed with input from the same P.R. agency that played a key role in branding Starbucks Coffee and New Balance running shoes. A Marley Natural slogan, \"Make way for the positive day,\" has already been introduced. At least one of Bob Marley\\'s quotes \\u2013 \"When you smoke the herb it reveals you to yourself\" \\u2013 is also being used in the marketing campaign for Marley Natural. Members of the deceased reggae singer-songwriter\\'s family announced Marley Natural on Tuesday morning\\'s edition of the TV show NBC Today.  An accompanying video, narrated by an unidentified woman and featuring Marley\\'s classic songs \"One Love\" and \"Could You Be Loved,\" proclaims that Marley Natural is \"inspired by a deep respect for nature, for its power to awaken our well-being, we embark on a new chapter of his legacy to realize more fully the benefits of cannabis for the mind, body and spirit. Make way for the positive day.\"  The video makes no mention of Bob Marley having been, as many Jamaicans and reggae artists are to this day, a devout Rastarfarian. The monotheistic Rastafari religious movement regards marijuana as a \\u201csacrament\\u201d and contends its use is, in fact, sanctioned by the Bible. How so? Rastafarians point to a line in Psalms 104:14: \\u201cHe causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man.\\u201d The video also omits any mention of the fact Marley reportedly smoked nearly a pound of pot per week.  Marley Natural is the brainchild of the Seattle-based private equity company Privateer Holdings, which exclusively focuses on marijuana industry products and investments. Marley Natural will also sell an array of other pot-related products, including marijuana creams, lotions and various accessories, such as e-cigarette-styled vaporizers, inspired by both Marley and marijuana. In a taped video statement provided to NBC News, Cedella Marley, 47, Bob\\'s first-born daughter, said: \"It just seems natural that Daddy should be part of this conversation. As Daddy would say: \\'Make way for the positive day\\'.\" The video also includes Rohan Marley, 42, one of Bob and Rita Marley\\'s sons. \"Herb is for the healing of the nation,\" he said. \"Herb is for the meditation; herb is for the higher vibrations.\" Cedella and Rohan\\'s mother, Rita Marley, agrees, saying: \\u201cMy husband believed \\u2018the herb\\u2019 was a natural and positive part of life, and he felt it was important to the world. He looked forward to this day.\\u201d Apparently, Marley also looked forward to more widespread marijuana cultivation and sales. Be relevant, respectful, honest, discreet and responsible.

The history of marijuana use and prohibition is a symphony of power, ignorance, and corruption, and we aren\\u2019t going to attempt to give you a detailed recap here.\\xa0 (If you are interested, though, there are good histories and timelines here, here, here, here, andhere)\\xa0 Known uses go back before 7000 BC, and marijuana (or hemp) has been used for food, incense, medicine, fabric, rope, paper, cosmetics, fuel, and more.\\xa0 The first laws concerning marijuana didn\\u2019t prohibit it; in fact they required farmers to grow hemp!\\xa0 Marijuana was effectively made illegal in 1937 with the Marijuana Tax Act, and when theTax Act was found unconstitutional in 1969, Congress rolled it into 1970\\u2019s Controlled Substances Act.\\xa0 On a Federal level pot remains an illegal Schedule 1 drug (classed with heroin and LSD), but on a state level laws range from states like Oklahoma where you can be get a life sentence for selling a $10 bag to the 23 states (and DC) that have legalized medical marijuana and the four states that have now legalized it for recreational use. \\xa0(Pot has been decriminalized in Oregon since 1973, the first state to do so.) While no substance is completely safe, marijuana is one of the safest around.\\xa0 There is no lethal overdose, it is not physically addictive, and it even has mildly beneficial qualities.\\xa0 Smoking (or eating) marijuana makes you feel relaxed and maybe a little giggly.\\xa0 When pot was first made illegal it wasn\\u2019t because of people actually being hurt or going on drug-fueled killing sprees, it was because of an organized propaganda campaign. \\xa0Support for criminalization came from people who were unfamiliar with and scared of marijuana\\u2019s effects, from people who were overtly racist against the groups using it, and from industrial interests who would prosper if hemp were made illegal.\\xa0 As an example, one notable booster was the Dupont Chemical Company, whose recent patent for nylon directly competed with hemp products. \\xa0In the south and west, marijuana was linked with an influx of Mexican immigrants.\\xa0 In the north and east it was linked with jazz music and black people.\\xa0 This quote from Harry J. Anslinger, one of the driving forces behind marijuana prohibition, sums up the slurs against all the \\u201cpot fiends\\u201d at the time\\u2026 \\u201cThere are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the US, and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos, and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz, and swing, result from marijuana use. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers, and any others.\\u201d What has been the effect of criminalization? Regardless of why marijuana was initially made illegal, we\\u2019ve lived with the effects ever since.\\xa0 While prohibition laws did not reduce use, they did increase the costs to our society.\\xa0 With pot laws falling around the country, it\\u2019s easy to forget that there are still people serving life sentences for possession of marijuana.\\xa0 We could detail the corrupt cops, the clogged courts, the destroyed lives, but the the ACLU has done an excellent job for us.\\xa0 In their project on Marijuana Law Reform, they have an excellent series of slides called \\u201cMarijuana Arrests By The Numbers\\u201d detailing just how destructive these laws have become.\\xa0 We highly encourage you to visit their site, but graphics from their excellent slideshow on the subject are below.\\xa0 For more detail, they also have information onmarijuana reform around the country. There are several other sources we\\u2019d like to direct you\\xa0to for in-depth information about marijuana prohibition, its history, its effects, and its future.\\xa0 The first is NORML, The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.\\xa0 Since their founding in 1970, NORML has been the premiere advocate for rational pot policies. \\xa0The link below will take you to their report on the 60-year prohibition on pot. As an advocacy group, NORML may well be a little biased.\\xa0 A more journalistic briefing, yet still fair and in-depth, comes from FRONTLINE and their episode \\u201cBusted-\\xa0 America\\u2019s War On Marijuana\\u201c. There are several common misconceptions about marijuana, and the Drug Policy Alliancehas put together a page addressing 10 of the most common ones. \\xa0Questions include \\u201cDoes marijuana use have long term cognitive effects?\\u201d, \\u201cIs marijuana a gateway drug?\\u201d, and \\u201cDoes marijuana impair driving the way alcohol does?\\u201d What will be the effects of the new law in Oregon? The new law has already had some effects as Portland prosecutors begin reviewing their marijuana possession cases.\\xa0 This Oregonian article goes into much greater detail.\\xa0\\xa0 TheMarijuana Policy Project has a point-by-point analysis of the Measure 91, but here are some of the high points\\u2026 What\\u2019s the future of marijuana legalization? People around the country are grappling with balancing the harms from drugs with the harms from legalizing them.\\xa0 As the harms becomes clearer, the traditional balance is changing and it\\u2019s beginning to tilt toward legalization.\\xa0 According to Politics Cheat Sheet, we are \\u201con the precipice of more states preparing for coming marijuana legalization initiatives, either derived from state legislators or from citizens themselves through the ballots\\u201d.\\xa0 They say Massachusetts, California, Missouri, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, and Arizona may go green as soon as 2016. Of course, rational drug policy (or any rational policy) isn\\u2019t as simple as legalize or don\\u2019t.\\xa0 Frontline, as part of its marijuana coverage, featured a judge-led \\u201cattempt at a rational discussion of the so-called \\u2018war on drugs\\u2019\\u201c. \\u201cA group of experts with varying political perspectives (law enforcement, treatment practitioners, elected officials, policy analysts, laboratory and clinical researchers) recently proposed \\u2018a third way\\u2019 to end the drug problem and avoid the current polarization. They hope to spark a rethinking of the country\\u2019s approach to drug policy.\\xa0 They are proposing not legalization and not a \\u2018war on drugs.\\u2019 Rather, 5 policies based on science and evaluated by their results rather than their symbolic value. Here is an outline of their fourteen principles for practical drug policies.

Share Photo \\n                        Bob Marley, who died in 1981, is now playing a key role in a new global line of marijuana products. EFE/Archivo\\n                         More than 33 years after he died of cancer, Jamaican reggae music legend Bob Marley is getting ready to stir things up posthumously , if not lively up the surging commercial marijuana market, as the name and face of what is being billed as the world\\'s first international marijuana brand. Marley Natural, which is described as \"heirloom Jamaican cannabis strains,\\u201d is targeted to ship before the end of 2015 to sales outlets in countries where pot is legal. To help ensure a big roll-out, Marley Natural products will be packaged and marketed with input from the same P.R. agency that played a key role in branding Starbucks Coffee and New Balance running shoes. A Marley Natural slogan, \"Make way for the positive day,\" has already been introduced. At least one of Bob Marley\\'s quotes \\u2013 \"When you smoke the herb it reveals you to yourself\" \\u2013 is also being used in the marketing campaign for Marley Natural. Members of the deceased reggae singer-songwriter\\'s family announced Marley Natural on Tuesday morning\\'s edition of the TV show NBC Today.  An accompanying video, narrated by an unidentified woman and featuring Marley\\'s classic songs \"One Love\" and \"Could You Be Loved,\" proclaims that Marley Natural is \"inspired by a deep respect for nature, for its power to awaken our well-being, we embark on a new chapter of his legacy to realize more fully the benefits of cannabis for the mind, body and spirit. Make way for the positive day.\"  The video makes no mention of Bob Marley having been, as many Jamaicans and reggae artists are to this day, a devout Rastarfarian. The monotheistic Rastafari religious movement regards marijuana as a \\u201csacrament\\u201d and contends its use is, in fact, sanctioned by the Bible. How so? Rastafarians point to a line in Psalms 104:14: \\u201cHe causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man.\\u201d The video also omits any mention of the fact Marley reportedly smoked nearly a pound of pot per week.  Marley Natural is the brainchild of the Seattle-based private equity company Privateer Holdings, which exclusively focuses on marijuana industry products and investments. Marley Natural will also sell an array of other pot-related products, including marijuana creams, lotions and various accessories, such as e-cigarette-styled vaporizers, inspired by both Marley and marijuana. In a taped video statement provided to NBC News, Cedella Marley, 47, Bob\\'s first-born daughter, said: \"It just seems natural that Daddy should be part of this conversation. As Daddy would say: \\'Make way for the positive day\\'.\" The video also includes Rohan Marley, 42, one of Bob and Rita Marley\\'s sons. \"Herb is for the healing of the nation,\" he said. \"Herb is for the meditation; herb is for the higher vibrations.\" Cedella and Rohan\\'s mother, Rita Marley, agrees, saying: \\u201cMy husband believed \\u2018the herb\\u2019 was a natural and positive part of life, and he felt it was important to the world. He looked forward to this day.\\u201d Apparently, Marley also looked forward to more widespread marijuana cultivation and sales. Be relevant, respectful, honest, discreet and responsible. Commenting Rules It\\u2019s fair to say that\\xa0Bob Marley\\xa0probably\\xa0could not have\\xa0imagined that\\xa033 years after his death, his\\xa0name would be lent to what is about to\\xa0be the newest entrant to the burgeoning legal marijuana market. The reggae icon was perhaps the most prominent and outspoken advocate of the drug throughout his life and at the height of his fame. He\\xa0viewed it as a spiritual and creative force that was probably more likely to be legalized by  \\u201cChrist\\u2019s government\\u201d than governments\\xa0here on Earth. But times have changed\\xa0\\u2013 in a big way. Look no further than Tuesday\\u2019s announcement by Marley\\u2019s family that it plans to\\xa0piggyback on successful efforts to\\xa0legalize marijuana in the United States and elsewhere\\xa0by introducing\\xa0a new brand of marijuana products bearing the late singer\\u2019s name. \\u201cMarley Natural\\u201d is being launched by\\xa0Privateer Holdings, a cannabis industry investment firm, and products will reach the market in\\xa0late 2015. \\u201cMy dad would be so happy to see people understanding the healing power of the herb,\\u201d Marley\\u2019s daughter\\xa0Cedella Marley\\xa0said in a news release.\\xa0\\u201cHe viewed the herb as something spiritual that could awaken our well-being, deepen our reflection, connect us to nature and liberate our creativity.\\u201d \\u201cMarley Natural is an authentic way to honor his legacy by adding his voice to the conversation about cannabis and helping end the social harms caused by prohibition,\\u201d she added. It will offer\\xa0organically grown heirloom Jamaican marijuana strains, in keeping with Marley\\u2019s preference for high-quality marijuana grown without the use of fertilizer. And it will be available in jurisdictions that allow recreational or medicinal marijuana sales. The brand also plans to offer cannabis- and hemp-infused products such as lotions and sun-repair creams. Marley\\xa0reportedly smoked as much as a pound of marijuana per week. But at the time of his intense fame in the United States and around the world, he was viewed as a nonconformist symbol. Marley has become even more of a global icon and brand in the years since\\xa0his death, but that it\\u2019s now happening\\xa0in a world in which marijuana is decriminalized in some places is something even he didn\\u2019t foresee. \\u201cLegalize herb? Boy, I jus\\u2019 don\\u2019 know. It\\u2019s kinda legalized already,\\u201d he noted in a 1976 interview with High Times. He was referring to the widespread use and cultivation of marijuana in Jamaica, where the drug has actually been illegal for over 100 years. And change is coming there, too. In late September, the Jamaican government announced that it is considering support for a proposal to decriminalize\\xa0possession of small amounts of what Marley and Rastafarians called the \\u201choly herb\\u201d if it is being used for\\xa0medicinal, and eventually, religious purposes. That is a direct result of the loosening of\\xa0legalization laws in some U.S. states\\u2013 though marijuana remains an illegal schedule I substance under Federal law.\\xa0 Over the years, critics of harsh marijuana laws have\\xa0argued\\xa0that the\\xa0penalties have done little to\\xa0stamp out organized crime associated with the\\xa0trafficking of black market drugs, including marijuana, through the island. And of course, there is potentially huge financial upside, as the investment firm Privateer Holdings has sought to demonstrate with its recent business ventures\\xa0in the marijuana space. \\u201cThe time has come to provide an opportunity for Jamaicans to benefit from the marijuana industry,\\u201d said Kingston\\u2019s mayor Angela Brown Burke recently, according to the Associated Press.\\xa0 According to a release, the brand will have an unspecified philanthropic component to \\u201censure that families and communities who have been harmed by prohibition have the opportunity to benefit from the new, legal cannabis economy,\\u201d the company\\u2019s announcement said. \\u201cMy husband believed \\u2018the herb\\u2019 was a natural and positive part of life and he felt it was important to the world,\\u201d Marley\\u2019s wife Rita said in a statement. \\u201cHe looked forward to this day.\\u201d ',\n",

The line will include pot-infused creams, accessories (like vaporizers in the style of e-cigarettes) and strains of \"heirloom Jamaican cannabis,\" inspired by the herb that Marley liked to smoke.

How do you avoid becoming a cannabis \\u201ccookie casualty\\u201d like Maureen Dowd?\\n Understand that cannabis is a psychoactive drug. Develop a basic understanding how cannabis works.  Determine the dose of cannabis that will produce the desired outcome, whether medicinally or recreationally.  Just because cannabis overdose doesn\\u2019t kill people, does not mean it can be consumed without reasonable attention to dose. An oral cannabis overdose can be terrifying. Lack of understanding about how cannabis works and not paying attention to dose (clearly printed on the labels of Colorado edibles such as Dowd consumed) made Maureen Dowd\\u2019s experience with cannabis edibles unpleasant.  Many side effects from cannabis are dose-dependent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u201cLisa\\u201d (a pseudonym) designs edibles under the names Kaya and Full Upright Position, as seen here at LAPCG in Los Angeles. Part of what makes these \\u201cmedibles\\u201d special is the very precise dosing. They're also yummy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n How is cannabis a drug? \\n Cannabis produces over 770 chemical compounds, 90 percent of them in trace amounts.  The primary active compounds in cannabis are the cannabinoids and include THC, CBD and CBG.  Only THC is psychoactive, but both CBD and CBG possess potent medicinal activity and modify the effects of THC.  The other primary effects of cannabis are produced by cannabis\\u2019s essential oils, a common class of plant chemicals called terpenes.  Terpenes can be absorbed orally through the mucous membranes of the mouth, but do not survive digestion if chewed up and swallowed.  Myrcene, one of these terpenes (also produced by thyme and lemongrass), is thought to interact with THC and produce the sedative indica effect of smoked or vaporized cannabis varieties. Other terpenes such as beta-caryophyllene and pinene may contribute to the stimulating sativa effect of other cannabis varieties when inhaled.  However, when cannabis medicines are swallowed, they do not exhibit these sativa or indica effects.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n A photograph of the edibles \\u201cLisa\\u201d designs, which are currently sold under the brand names Kaya and Full Upright Position. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n How does cannabis affect our bodies and brains?\\n We still learning how cannabis works, though that understanding is improving rapidly.  In the late Eighties, the body\\u2019s endocannabinoid system was discovered, with which cannabis interacts.  The endocannabinoid system is a regulatory mechanism that modulates the release of compounds produced throughout the body.  As  biomolecular chemist Vincenzo Di Marzo has written, the endocannabinoid system\\u2019s role balances how we relax, eat, sleep, forget and protect. Providing this balance and modulation of signaling throughout the body, the endocannabinoid system is sensitive to doses of the compounds found in cannabis that mimic the body\\u2019s own endocannabinoids.  Endocannabinoids in the brain interact with endocannabinoid protein receptors to regulate and modulate the release of neurotransmitters between neurons. The system reacts to repeated high doses of cannabis by reducing the density of the receptors with which cannabinoids interact, a process called down regulation.  As the size and frequency of cannabis dose increases, the density of endocannabinoid receptor targets decreases.  This tolerance to the effects of cannabis is why the same dose that a heavy cannabis user consumes easily overwhelms a newbie.  Again, it\\u2019s all about dose. If you want to avoid down-regulation, control your dose. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n What is the difference between vaping, smoking, and consuming cannabis orally through edibles or tinctures?\\n The tradition of consuming cannabis orally is ancient, perhaps ten thousand years old, while cannabis smoking is much more recent.  There are scattered references to inhaling cannabis smoke in ancient times, but cannabis was not commonly smoked before the 16th century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n A photograph of Lisa's edibles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n When cannabis is smoked or vaporized, its delta-9-THC is absorbed through the lungs and reaches the brain quickly.  When cannabis edibles are swallowed, the delta-9-THC undergoes a transformation within the liver into 11-hydroxy-THC, a different drug twice as strong that lasts twice as long as inhaled delta-9-THC.  Oral absorption and liver metabolism of cannabis take much, much longer than when it is smoked.  Maureen Dowd didn\\u2019t feel the effects of the edible she ate for almost an hour, so she took more\\u2026 a common and unfortunate error.  There is wide variation among individuals in how quickly they will perceive the effects of oral cannabis, with some individuals taking over three hours to note effects.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n It\\u2019s important for individuals to develop an idea of how they personally metabolize any oral cannabis preparation, starting with a very small dose and remaining patient until it\\u2019s thoroughly metabolized over six hours, before taking more. There will be some variation in cannabis absorption through the digestive tract depending on stomach contents and its composition. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n The pot available in dispensaries today is radically different than what our parents or grandparents might have toked. How has marijuana changed over the years, and how do the genetic changes in the plant influence dosage and how the drug affects us?\\n \\r\\nUltra-high THC potency cannabis is relatively recent.  For most of our twelve thousand year history with cannabis, cultivated cannabis drug varieties produced only two or three percent THC.  The legendary Thai Stick variety contained around eight percent.  Even cannabis resin, hashish, rarely topped twenty percent THC.  But prohibition encourages potency and an aggressive drug war encouraged it more.  Potent plants require less space, which aids their concealment.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nAfter a thirty-five year War on Drugs, cannabis can exceed twenty-five percent THC.  Cannabis resin often exceeds fifty percent, and cannabis oils can top seventy percent THC.  Increased potency is not really the issue that prohibitionists claim; but it does reduce the margin of error when consuming cannabis.  Like beer vs. whiskey doses, only a fool would pour and consume a pint of whiskey, because most drinkers learn to dose alcohol.  Similarly, cannabis users learn that higher-potency cannabis reduces the amount required.  But individuals only having experience with the low-potency cannabis of the Seventies and Eighties can be unpleasantly overwhelmed when consuming today\\u2019s cannabis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n The chemical balance of cannabis has changed since the Sixties.  Cannabis breeders for the past forty years have selected plants that produced the highest levels of THC.  Unbeknownst to them, many of the early cannabis varieties contained significant levels of CBD as well as THC.  CBD is a cannabinoid that is not psychoactive but medicinally valuable and CBD reduces many of the adverse effects produced by THC.  Today\\u2019s cannabis produces THC, and rarely any CBD.  Recently, varieties producing CBD have become more available thanks to the testing labs searching for CBD cannabis varieties and organizations such as Project CBD.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Her edible cannabis products are delicious, as well as being reliably dosed. Ingredients are high-quality gourmet, and they're prepared in a hygienic professional environment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n How do you determine what a proper dose of herbal cannabis or infused edible is, and what\\u2019s the science behind cannabis dosage?\\n Research on dosing herbal cannabis has been hampered by federal law.  What is known about herbal cannabis dose is primarily based on anecdote, hundreds of thousands of them, with some extrapolation from doses of prescription cannabis medicines such as Marinol and Sativex.  Despite the volume of experience, anecdotal guidance barely suffices.  With less prohibition and more research, we would be much more precise in understanding the use of herbal cannabis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Too many people calculate a dose of cannabis by the amount of THC psychoactivity they can comfortably withstand. A more informed approach to cannabis dose is to determine the minimum dose needed to reach the desired outcome.  This minimum dose approach can be challenging when today\\u2019s herbal cannabis can average 15 percent THC in dispensaries in California, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCannabis users in the Sixties often consumed an entire joint.  Back in the day, a one-gram joint of 2% THC cannabis typically contained about twenty milligrams of THC.  A person smoking that joint would absorb around seven milligrams of THC, the rest lost to combustion and sidestream smoke. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy comparison, that one-gram joint filled with a contemporary high-THC variety like OG Kush could contain 250 milligrams of THC.  A single 50 milligram inhalation of high-potency cannabis oil (a \\u201cdab\\u201d) can deliver a dose equal to over four joints of Mexican commercial weed from the Seventies.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRemember that the THC in orally consumed cannabis will be metabolized by the liver into 11-hydroxy-THC and this form is twice as strong and will last twice as long as regular THC. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe threshold of THC psychoactivity for most people when consumed orally beneath the tongue or swallowed is just below two milligrams of THC.  A cannabis dose for pain begins at around two milligrams and for most new medical cannabis patients tops out at about ten milligrams per dose.  In a study of smoked cannabis at University of California, San Diego, researchers noted a \\u201csweet spot\\u201d of dose for smoked cannabis in treating pain.  Too small a dose produced little relief, while too high a dose actually increased the pain levels in the study subjects.  Cannabis dose for pain relief presents a \\u201cGoldilocks\\u201d conundrum to find a dose that is \\u201cjust right.\\u201d  Most individuals unused to the effects of THC in cannabis become uncomfortably high at doses of fifteen milligrams or more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother challenge of taking cannabis orally is that only 10 to 20 percent of the dose reaches systemic circulation after its liver transformation into 11-hydroxy-THC.  On an empty stomach, the onset of effects is typically thirty to sixty minutes and the THC psychoactivity lasts four to eight hours. Medicinal effects such as appetite stimulation can persist for 24 hours or more after a dose of THC.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven grams of twelve percent THC high-quality indoor cannabis infused into fifty grams of butter in slow cooker at 200 degrees for three hours will extract around 600 milligrams of THC. (For geeks, there is some loss in converting raw acidic THC to bioactive THC when heated by cooking, vaporizing or smoking.  The raw THCA gives up a carboxyl group and converts to its neutral THC form. Additionally, the butter extraction method is not perfectly efficient.)  That butter infused into a batch of twenty cookies will result in a cookie containing thirty milligrams of THC, which would be considered three portions under Colorado\\u2019s cannabis edible regulations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are some basic anecdotal rules of thumb concerning THC dose for occasional cannabis users. Again, these are anecdotal and should not be considered professional or medical advice.  Remember that there are genetic differences among individuals, so doses and onset times vary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2 mg:  threshold of psychoactivity for infrequent users. Very little to no impairment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2.5 mg:  most report psychoactivity equal to a glass of wine or a beer. Doses in this range are popular for social anxiety, encouraging the munchies, and focus.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n5 mg:  nearly all occasional users will note significant psychoactivity.  Significant appetite stimulation.  Mild psychoactivity, akin to two to three glasses of wine. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n10 mg:  Strong psychoactivity for most occasional users.  Significant distraction from pain.  This dose is often recommended by physicians to stem nausea from chemotherapy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n15 mg:  Most occasional users report uncomfortable levels of psychoactivity at this dose.  Regular users of cannabis do not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1000 mg:  the most potent edible available in California dispensaries.  This is ten times the maximum THC content of the edibles permitted by law to be sold in Colorado adult-use cannabis shops.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA photograph of Lisa's edibles.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy are there thousand-milligram cannabis edibles? That seems impossibly strong.\\nBecause individuals that consume a lot of cannabis, and consume it often, develop receptor down-regulation, building up a tolerance to effects of cannabis.  In a research study, participants were given over 200 milligrams/day of THC everyday.  In just twelve days, those enormous doses were no longer getting the participants uncomfortably high, because the density of their cannabinoid receptors was reduced in response to this chronic exposure. The good news about cannabis tolerance is that it appears completely reversible.  Twenty-eight days of abstinence from THC has been shown in another study to up-regulate cannabinoid receptors to their normal density.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about cannabidiol, or CBD, in edibles? People are talking about that the therapeutic effect of CBD these days.\\nCBD when combined with THC can reduce some of the adverse effects of THC. However, patients report that when combined, CBD and THC, at low doses, appear slightly synergistic and produce more psychoactivity together. In a British study, hair samples from regular cannabis users that contained both THC and CBD were associated with far fewer self-reported episodes resembling psychosis than hair samples that contained only THC.  It is thought that CBD may prevent some of the long-term adverse effects of THC use.  Edibles and tinctures containing only CBD are popular with patients suffering from anxiety, some mental illnesses and seizure disorders.  A CBD/THC prescription medicine called Sativex is available in Europe and Canada.  It is currently undergoing the approval process in the US. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can the average person determine dose when they\\u2019re buying herb or cannabis edibles?\\nIt\\u2019s very difficult to do it without access to lab-tested cannabis, or engaging in careful trial and error experimentation.  Far too few individuals have access to lab-tested and properly labeled herbal cannabis, extractions and infusions, which are only available in Washington, Colorado, California, Oregon, New Mexico, Arizona and Canada.  Cannabis testing facilities will continue to open as more states reform their cannabis laws to enable medical and adult access.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can users best ensure they have a pleasant experience when using a cannabis edible? \\nKnow the dose.  The most crucial advice is to know the dose of what\\u2019s being consumed. Most unpleasant edible experiences begin with taking an edible of unknown potency, made by someone with a high tolerance to THC, then shared with a person with little tolerance for THC.  Taking an edible of unknown potency is psychoactive Russian roulette.  Always begin with a tiny fraction of any unlabeled edible, then wait a full three hours to gauge the intensity of its effects.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe setting in which the edible is being consumed is also important.  A relaxed, unpressured environment is certainly more conducive to the more intense psychoactivity of a higher THC dose than when the same dose is consumed in a demanding environment surrounded by strangers.  On the other hand, a very small dose of THC or especially CBD is reported by patients to reduce social anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about kids and pets?\\nThe palatability of cannabis edibles containing THC means they need to be kept away from any unsuspecting adult, child or animal.  Always.  No exceptions.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat should someone do if they realize they have taken too much cannabis?\\nDoctors I\\u2019ve asked say a Pixar movie, then a nap.  A little caffeine seems to help reduce the effects, but never when someone is too anxious.  It is easier to avoid the problem than fix it.  And avoid alcohol and nicotine, both of which are mildly synergistic with THC. Children and pets may need medical attention, which is why cannabis edibles should always be kept far away from kids and companion animals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do you do, and what is your background?\\nI design and formulate edibles.  I come from a design and engineering background and also have a strong interest in gastronomy and ethnobotanicals. The challenge of how to create more precise and palatable edible cannabis medicines was appealing and I\\u2019ve found working with people in need of cannabis medicines to be deeply satisfying.  I\\u2019ve licensed my formulations to a few dispensaries in California and they make them to my specifications.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat makes your approach to edibles different?\\nI design edibles for patients seeking the minimum effective dose of cannabis for the condition for which their physician has recommended the use of medical cannabis.  They want to minimize impairment.   The Full Upright Position line of cannabis infused products that I designed are intended to provide no more impairment than a glass of wine.  I wanted to design a product that a patient on a treatment course from their physician could use immediately, reducing the risk of a Maureen Dowd-style dose nightmare.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about pain, and cancer patients who need higher doses to help with issues like post-chemotherapy nausea and vomiting?\\nI designed a product called Kaya that has been licensed by a few dispensaries in Los Angeles.  Kaya is extremely potent and contains eight 10 milligram doses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you have any products that contain CBD?\\nCurrently the Kona line that I designed provides low doses of both CBD and THC. Later this year, I plan to license two additional formulations that contain CBD: Nova and Kaya CBD. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere can the products that you formulated be found?\\nThey are available in Los Angeles.  Three dispensaries have licensed the formulas and produce them for their patients.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2022 Los Angeles Patients and Caregivers Group\\n\\u2022 Koreatown Collective\\n\\u2022 Pure Life Wellness\\n\\u2022 California Patients Alliance\\n\\u2022 Buds and Roses\\nPreviously at Boing Boing\\n\\u2022 How I use medical marijuana: vaporizers, science, weed, and cancer\\n\\u2022 My Dinner with Marijuana: chemo, cannabis, and haute cuisine\\n\\nSpecial thanks to Ascent by DaVinci for sponsoring this series.

Medicinal effects such as appetite stimulation can persist for 24 hours or more after a dose of THC.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven grams of twelve percent THC high-quality indoor cannabis infused into fifty grams of butter in slow cooker at 200 degrees for three hours will extract around 600 milligrams of THC. (For geeks, there is some loss in converting raw acidic THC to bioactive THC when heated by cooking, vaporizing or smoking.  The raw THCA gives up a carboxyl group and converts to its neutral THC form. Additionally, the butter extraction method is not perfectly efficient.)  That butter infused into a batch of twenty cookies will result in a cookie containing thirty milligrams of THC, which would be considered three portions under Colorado\\u2019s cannabis edible regulations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are some basic anecdotal rules of thumb concerning THC dose for occasional cannabis users. Again, these are anecdotal and should not be considered professional or medical advice.  Remember that there are genetic differences among individuals, so doses and onset times vary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2 mg:  threshold of psychoactivity for infrequent users. Very little to no impairment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2.5 mg:  most report psychoactivity equal to a glass of wine or a beer. Doses in this range are popular for social anxiety, encouraging the munchies, and focus.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n5 mg:  nearly all occasional users will note significant psychoactivity.  Significant appetite stimulation.  Mild psychoactivity, akin to two to three glasses of wine. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n10 mg:  Strong psychoactivity for most occasional users.  Significant distraction from pain.  This dose is often recommended by physicians to stem nausea from chemotherapy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n15 mg:  Most occasional users report uncomfortable levels of psychoactivity at this dose.  Regular users of cannabis do not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1000 mg:  the most potent edible available in California dispensaries.  This is ten times the maximum THC content of the edibles permitted by law to be sold in Colorado adult-use cannabis shops.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA photograph of Lisa's edibles.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy are there thousand-milligram cannabis edibles? That seems impossibly strong.\\nBecause individuals that consume a lot of cannabis, and consume it often, develop receptor down-regulation, building up a tolerance to effects of cannabis.  In a research study, participants were given over 200 milligrams/day of THC everyday.  In just twelve days, those enormous doses were no longer getting the participants uncomfortably high, because the density of their cannabinoid receptors was reduced in response to this chronic exposure. The good news about cannabis tolerance is that it appears completely reversible.  Twenty-eight days of abstinence from THC has been shown in another study to up-regulate cannabinoid receptors to their normal density.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about cannabidiol, or CBD, in edibles? People are talking about that the therapeutic effect of CBD these days.\\nCBD when combined with THC can reduce some of the adverse effects of THC. However, patients report that when combined, CBD and THC, at low doses, appear slightly synergistic and produce more psychoactivity together. In a British study, hair samples from regular cannabis users that contained both THC and CBD were associated with far fewer self-reported episodes resembling psychosis than hair samples that contained only THC.  It is thought that CBD may prevent some of the long-term adverse effects of THC use.  Edibles and tinctures containing only CBD are popular with patients suffering from anxiety, some mental illnesses and seizure disorders.  A CBD/THC prescription medicine called Sativex is available in Europe and Canada.  It is currently undergoing the approval process in the US. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can the average person determine dose when they\\u2019re buying herb or cannabis edibles?\\nIt\\u2019s very difficult to do it without access to lab-tested cannabis, or engaging in careful trial and error experimentation.  Far too few individuals have access to lab-tested and properly labeled herbal cannabis, extractions and infusions, which are only available in Washington, Colorado, California, Oregon, New Mexico, Arizona and Canada.  Cannabis testing facilities will continue to open as more states reform their cannabis laws to enable medical and adult access.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can users best ensure they have a pleasant experience when using a cannabis edible? \\nKnow the dose.  The most crucial advice is to know the dose of what\\u2019s being consumed. Most unpleasant edible experiences begin with taking an edible of unknown potency, made by someone with a high tolerance to THC, then shared with a person with little tolerance for THC.  Taking an edible of unknown potency is psychoactive Russian roulette.  Always begin with a tiny fraction of any unlabeled edible, then wait a full three hours to gauge the intensity of its effects.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe setting in which the edible is being consumed is also important.  A relaxed, unpressured environment is certainly more conducive to the more intense psychoactivity of a higher THC dose than when the same dose is consumed in a demanding environment surrounded by strangers.  On the other hand, a very small dose of THC or especially CBD is reported by patients to reduce social anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about kids and pets?\\nThe palatability of cannabis edibles containing THC means they need to be kept away from any unsuspecting adult, child or animal.  Always.  No exceptions.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat should someone do if they realize they have taken too much cannabis?\\nDoctors I\\u2019ve asked say a Pixar movie, then a nap.  A little caffeine seems to help reduce the effects, but never when someone is too anxious.  It is easier to avoid the problem than fix it.  And avoid alcohol and nicotine, both of which are mildly synergistic with THC. Children and pets may need medical attention, which is why cannabis edibles should always be kept far away from kids and companion animals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do you do, and what is your background?\\nI design and formulate edibles.  I come from a design and engineering background and also have a strong interest in gastronomy and ethnobotanicals. The challenge of how to create more precise and palatable edible cannabis medicines was appealing and I\\u2019ve found working with people in need of cannabis medicines to be deeply satisfying.  I\\u2019ve licensed my formulations to a few dispensaries in California and they make them to my specifications.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat makes your approach to edibles different?\\nI design edibles for patients seeking the minimum effective dose of cannabis for the condition for which their physician has recommended the use of medical cannabis.  They want to minimize impairment.   The Full Upright Position line of cannabis infused products that I designed are intended to provide no more impairment than a glass of wine.  I wanted to design a product that a patient on a treatment course from their physician could use immediately, reducing the risk of a Maureen Dowd-style dose nightmare.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about pain, and cancer patients who need higher doses to help with issues like post-chemotherapy nausea and vomiting?\\nI designed a product called Kaya that has been licensed by a few dispensaries in Los Angeles.  Kaya is extremely potent and contains eight 10 milligram doses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you have any products that contain CBD?\\nCurrently the Kona line that I designed provides low doses of both CBD and THC. Later this year, I plan to license two additional formulations that contain CBD: Nova and Kaya CBD. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere can the products that you formulated be found?\\nThey are available in Los Angeles.  Three dispensaries have licensed the formulas and produce them for their patients.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2022 Los Angeles Patients and Caregivers Group\\n\\u2022 Koreatown Collective\\n\\u2022 Pure Life Wellness\\n\\u2022 California Patients Alliance\\n\\u2022 Buds and Roses\\nPreviously at Boing Boing\\n\\u2022 How I use medical marijuana: vaporizers, science, weed, and cancer\\n\\u2022 My Dinner with Marijuana: chemo, cannabis, and haute cuisine\\n\\nSpecial thanks to Ascent by DaVinci for sponsoring this series.

A cannabis dose for pain begins at around two milligrams and for most new medical cannabis patients tops out at about ten milligrams per dose.  In a study of smoked cannabis at University of California, San Diego, researchers noted a \\u201csweet spot\\u201d of dose for smoked cannabis in treating pain.  Too small a dose produced little relief, while too high a dose actually increased the pain levels in the study subjects.

The challenge of how to create more precise and palatable edible cannabis medicines was appealing and I\\u2019ve found working with people in need of cannabis medicines to be deeply satisfying.  I\\u2019ve licensed my formulations to a few dispensaries in California and they make them to my specifications.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat makes your approach to edibles different?\\nI design edibles for patients seeking the minimum effective dose of cannabis for the condition for which their physician has recommended the use of medical cannabis.  They want to minimize impairment.   The Full Upright Position line of cannabis infused products that I designed are intended to provide no more impairment than a glass of wine.  I wanted to design a product that a patient on a treatment course from their physician could use immediately, reducing the risk of a Maureen Dowd-style dose nightmare.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about pain, and cancer patients who need higher doses to help with issues like post-chemotherapy nausea and vomiting?\\nI designed a product called Kaya that has been licensed by a few dispensaries in Los Angeles.  Kaya is extremely potent and contains eight 10 milligram doses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you have any products that contain CBD?\\nCurrently the Kona line that I designed provides low doses of both CBD and THC. Later this year, I plan to license two additional formulations that contain CBD: Nova and Kaya CBD. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere can the products that you formulated be found?\\nThey are available in Los Angeles.  Three dispensaries have licensed the formulas and produce them for their patients.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2022 Los Angeles Patients and Caregivers Group\\n\\u2022 Koreatown Collective\\n\\u2022 Pure Life Wellness\\n\\u2022 California Patients Alliance\\n\\u2022 Buds and Roses\\nPreviously at Boing Boing\\n\\u2022 How I use medical marijuana: vaporizers, science, weed, and cancer\\n\\u2022 My Dinner with Marijuana: chemo, cannabis, and haute cuisine\\n\\nSpecial thanks to Ascent by DaVinci for sponsoring this series.

Again, these are anecdotal and should not be considered professional or medical advice.  Remember that there are genetic differences among individuals, so doses and onset times vary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2 mg:  threshold of psychoactivity for infrequent users. Very little to no impairment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2.5 mg:  most report psychoactivity equal to a glass of wine or a beer. Doses in this range are popular for social anxiety, encouraging the munchies, and focus.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n5 mg:  nearly all occasional users will note significant psychoactivity.  Significant appetite stimulation.  Mild psychoactivity, akin to two to three glasses of wine. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n10 mg:  Strong psychoactivity for most occasional users.  Significant distraction from pain.  This dose is often recommended by physicians to stem nausea from chemotherapy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n15 mg:  Most occasional users report uncomfortable levels of psychoactivity at this dose.  Regular users of cannabis do not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1000 mg:  the most potent edible available in California dispensaries.  This is ten times the maximum THC content of the edibles permitted by law to be sold in Colorado adult-use cannabis shops.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA photograph of Lisa's edibles.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy are there thousand-milligram cannabis edibles? That seems impossibly strong.\\nBecause individuals that consume a lot of cannabis, and consume it often, develop receptor down-regulation, building up a tolerance to effects of cannabis.  In a research study, participants were given over 200 milligrams/day of THC everyday.  In just twelve days, those enormous doses were no longer getting the participants uncomfortably high, because the density of their cannabinoid receptors was reduced in response to this chronic exposure. The good news about cannabis tolerance is that it appears completely reversible.  Twenty-eight days of abstinence from THC has been shown in another study to up-regulate cannabinoid receptors to their normal density.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about cannabidiol, or CBD, in edibles? People are talking about that the therapeutic effect of CBD these days.\\nCBD when combined with THC can reduce some of the adverse effects of THC. However, patients report that when combined, CBD and THC, at low doses, appear slightly synergistic and produce more psychoactivity together. In a British study, hair samples from regular cannabis users that contained both THC and CBD were associated with far fewer self-reported episodes resembling psychosis than hair samples that contained only THC.  It is thought that CBD may prevent some of the long-term adverse effects of THC use.  Edibles and tinctures containing only CBD are popular with patients suffering from anxiety, some mental illnesses and seizure disorders.  A CBD/THC prescription medicine called Sativex is available in Europe and Canada.  It is currently undergoing the approval process in the US. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can the average person determine dose when they\\u2019re buying herb or cannabis edibles?\\nIt\\u2019s very difficult to do it without access to lab-tested cannabis, or engaging in careful trial and error experimentation.  Far too few individuals have access to lab-tested and properly labeled herbal cannabis, extractions and infusions, which are only available in Washington, Colorado, California, Oregon, New Mexico, Arizona and Canada.  Cannabis testing facilities will continue to open as more states reform their cannabis laws to enable medical and adult access.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can users best ensure they have a pleasant experience when using a cannabis edible? \\nKnow the dose.  The most crucial advice is to know the dose of what\\u2019s being consumed. Most unpleasant edible experiences begin with taking an edible of unknown potency, made by someone with a high tolerance to THC, then shared with a person with little tolerance for THC.  Taking an edible of unknown potency is psychoactive Russian roulette.  Always begin with a tiny fraction of any unlabeled edible, then wait a full three hours to gauge the intensity of its effects.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe setting in which the edible is being consumed is also important.  A relaxed, unpressured environment is certainly more conducive to the more intense psychoactivity of a higher THC dose than when the same dose is consumed in a demanding environment surrounded by strangers.  On the other hand, a very small dose of THC or especially CBD is reported by patients to reduce social anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about kids and pets?\\nThe palatability of cannabis edibles containing THC means they need to be kept away from any unsuspecting adult, child or animal.  Always.  No exceptions.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat should someone do if they realize they have taken too much cannabis?\\nDoctors I\\u2019ve asked say a Pixar movie, then a nap.  A little caffeine seems to help reduce the effects, but never when someone is too anxious.  It is easier to avoid the problem than fix it.  And avoid alcohol and nicotine, both of which are mildly synergistic with THC. Children and pets may need medical attention, which is why cannabis edibles should always be kept far away from kids and companion animals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do you do, and what is your background?\\nI design and formulate edibles.

Twenty-eight days of abstinence from THC has been shown in another study to up-regulate cannabinoid receptors to their normal density.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about cannabidiol, or CBD, in edibles? People are talking about that the therapeutic effect of CBD these days.\\nCBD when combined with THC can reduce some of the adverse effects of THC. However, patients report that when combined, CBD and THC, at low doses, appear slightly synergistic and produce more psychoactivity together. In a British study, hair samples from regular cannabis users that contained both THC and CBD were associated with far fewer self-reported episodes resembling psychosis than hair samples that contained only THC.  It is thought that CBD may prevent some of the long-term adverse effects of THC use.  Edibles and tinctures containing only CBD are popular with patients suffering from anxiety, some mental illnesses and seizure disorders.  A CBD/THC prescription medicine called Sativex is available in Europe and Canada.  It is currently undergoing the approval process in the US. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can the average person determine dose when they\\u2019re buying herb or cannabis edibles?\\nIt\\u2019s very difficult to do it without access to lab-tested cannabis, or engaging in careful trial and error experimentation.  Far too few individuals have access to lab-tested and properly labeled herbal cannabis, extractions and infusions, which are only available in Washington, Colorado, California, Oregon, New Mexico, Arizona and Canada.  Cannabis testing facilities will continue to open as more states reform their cannabis laws to enable medical and adult access.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can users best ensure they have a pleasant experience when using a cannabis edible? \\nKnow the dose.  The most crucial advice is to know the dose of what\\u2019s being consumed. Most unpleasant edible experiences begin with taking an edible of unknown potency, made by someone with a high tolerance to THC, then shared with a person with little tolerance for THC.  Taking an edible of unknown potency is psychoactive Russian roulette.  Always begin with a tiny fraction of any unlabeled edible, then wait a full three hours to gauge the intensity of its effects.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe setting in which the edible is being consumed is also important.  A relaxed, unpressured environment is certainly more conducive to the more intense psychoactivity of a higher THC dose than when the same dose is consumed in a demanding environment surrounded by strangers.  On the other hand, a very small dose of THC or especially CBD is reported by patients to reduce social anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about kids and pets?\\nThe palatability of cannabis edibles containing THC means they need to be kept away from any unsuspecting adult, child or animal.  Always.  No exceptions.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat should someone do if they realize they have taken too much cannabis?\\nDoctors I\\u2019ve asked say a Pixar movie, then a nap.  A little caffeine seems to help reduce the effects, but never when someone is too anxious.  It is easier to avoid the problem than fix it.  And avoid alcohol and nicotine, both of which are mildly synergistic with THC. Children and pets may need medical attention, which is why cannabis edibles should always be kept far away from kids and companion animals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do you do, and what is your background?\\nI design and formulate edibles.  I come from a design and engineering background and also have a strong interest in gastronomy and ethnobotanicals.

I\\u2019ve licensed my formulations to a few dispensaries in California and they make them to my specifications.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat makes your approach to edibles different?\\nI design edibles for patients seeking the minimum effective dose of cannabis for the condition for which their physician has recommended the use of medical cannabis.  They want to minimize impairment.   The Full Upright Position line of cannabis infused products that I designed are intended to provide no more impairment than a glass of wine.  I wanted to design a product that a patient on a treatment course from their physician could use immediately, reducing the risk of a Maureen Dowd-style dose nightmare.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about pain, and cancer patients who need higher doses to help with issues like post-chemotherapy nausea and vomiting?\\nI designed a product called Kaya that has been licensed by a few dispensaries in Los Angeles.  Kaya is extremely potent and contains eight 10 milligram doses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you have any products that contain CBD?\\nCurrently the Kona line that I designed provides low doses of both CBD and THC.

Far too few individuals have access to lab-tested and properly labeled herbal cannabis, extractions and infusions, which are only available in Washington, Colorado, California, Oregon, New Mexico, Arizona and Canada.  Cannabis testing facilities will continue to open as more states reform their cannabis laws to enable medical and adult access.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can users best ensure they have a pleasant experience when using a cannabis edible? \\nKnow the dose.  The most crucial advice is to know the dose of what\\u2019s being consumed. Most unpleasant edible experiences begin with taking an edible of unknown potency, made by someone with a high tolerance to THC, then shared with a person with little tolerance for THC.  Taking an edible of unknown potency is psychoactive Russian roulette.  Always begin with a tiny fraction of any unlabeled edible, then wait a full three hours to gauge the intensity of its effects.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe setting in which the edible is being consumed is also important.  A relaxed, unpressured environment is certainly more conducive to the more intense psychoactivity of a higher THC dose than when the same dose is consumed in a demanding environment surrounded by strangers.  On the other hand, a very small dose of THC or especially CBD is reported by patients to reduce social anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about kids and pets?\\nThe palatability of cannabis edibles containing THC means they need to be kept away from any unsuspecting adult, child or animal.  Always.  No exceptions.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat should someone do if they realize they have taken too much cannabis?\\nDoctors I\\u2019ve asked say a Pixar movie, then a nap.  A little caffeine seems to help reduce the effects, but never when someone is too anxious.  It is easier to avoid the problem than fix it.  And avoid alcohol and nicotine, both of which are mildly synergistic with THC. Children and pets may need medical attention, which is why cannabis edibles should always be kept far away from kids and companion animals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do you do, and what is your background?\\nI design and formulate edibles.  I come from a design and engineering background and also have a strong interest in gastronomy and ethnobotanicals. The challenge of how to create more precise and palatable edible cannabis medicines was appealing and I\\u2019ve found working with people in need of cannabis medicines to be deeply satisfying.  I\\u2019ve licensed my formulations to a few dispensaries in California and they make them to my specifications.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat makes your approach to edibles different?\\nI design edibles for patients seeking the minimum effective dose of cannabis for the condition for which their physician has recommended the use of medical cannabis.  They want to minimize impairment.   The Full Upright Position line of cannabis infused products that I designed are intended to provide no more impairment than a glass of wine.  I wanted to design a product that a patient on a treatment course from their physician could use immediately, reducing the risk of a Maureen Dowd-style dose nightmare.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about pain, and cancer patients who need higher doses to help with issues like post-chemotherapy nausea and vomiting?\\nI designed a product called Kaya that has been licensed by a few dispensaries in Los Angeles.  Kaya is extremely potent and contains eight 10 milligram doses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you have any products that contain CBD?\\nCurrently the Kona line that I designed provides low doses of both CBD and THC. Later this year, I plan to license two additional formulations that contain CBD: Nova and Kaya CBD. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere can the products that you formulated be found?\\nThey are available in Los Angeles.  Three dispensaries have licensed the formulas and produce them for their patients.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2022 Los Angeles Patients and Caregivers Group\\n\\u2022 Koreatown Collective\\n\\u2022 Pure Life Wellness\\n\\u2022 California Patients Alliance\\n\\u2022 Buds and Roses\\nPreviously at Boing Boing\\n\\u2022 How I use medical marijuana: vaporizers, science, weed, and cancer\\n\\u2022 My Dinner with Marijuana: chemo, cannabis, and haute cuisine\\n\\nSpecial thanks to Ascent by DaVinci for sponsoring this series.

People are talking about that the therapeutic effect of CBD these days.\\nCBD when combined with THC can reduce some of the adverse effects of THC. However, patients report that when combined, CBD and THC, at low doses, appear slightly synergistic and produce more psychoactivity together. In a British study, hair samples from regular cannabis users that contained both THC and CBD were associated with far fewer self-reported episodes resembling psychosis than hair samples that contained only THC.  It is thought that CBD may prevent some of the long-term adverse effects of THC use.  Edibles and tinctures containing only CBD are popular with patients suffering from anxiety, some mental illnesses and seizure disorders.

        " 'By David Downs from the Smell the Truth blog on SFGate.com  New study finds marijuana therapy causes a dramatic reduction glioma brain tumor (shown above) cell lines (via Flickr Griselda Ramirez w CC license) The active molecules in cannabis kill brain cancer  another study has revealed. Scientists using an extract of whole-plant marijuana rich in pots main psychoactive ingredient THC as well as cannabidiol (CBD) showed dramatic reductions in tumor volumes of a type of brain cancer. High-grade glioma is one of the most aggressive cancers in adult humans and long-term survival rates are very low as standard treatments for glioma remain largely unsuccessful, according to researchers Katherine A. Scott, Angus G. Dalgleish, and Wai M. Liu from the Oncology Department at St. Georges University of London. Writing in Molecular Cancer Therapeutics this month, the team recounts how they decided to build on existing research that shows cannabinoids have been shown to specifically inhibit glioma growth as well as neutralize oncogenic processes such as angiogenesis. The researchers wanted to boost the success of cannabinoids, so they investigated using THC and CBD both alone and in combination with radiation in a number of glioma cell lines. Marijuana kills cancer cells in proportion to its dose and duration of treatment, researchers found, and whole plant cannabis rich in THC was more efficacious than pure, lab-grade THC alone. Moreover, pre-treating cells with THC and CBD for four hours prior to irradiation increased the cancer-killing effects of radiation. Scientists think THC and CBD prime cancer cells to commit suicide when exposed to radiation  a process called apoptosis. Related stories on The Pot Blog:    Tumors treated this way in mouse models for glioma showed dramatic results, with pot-treated tumors shrinking to nearly one-tenth the size of tumors in the control group. Taken together, our data highlight the possibility that these cannabinoids can prime glioma cells to respond better to ionizing radiation, and suggest a potential clinical benefit for glioma patients by using these two treatment modalities. The federal government states cannabis is a schedule one drug with no medical benefits and a high potential for abuse. However, 23 states have medical marijuana laws, and untold thousands of patients with untreatable gliomas are turning to cannabis not only for palliative treatment of chemo nausea and pain, but as an adjunctive therapy for treating the cancer itself. Patients who want to learn more about cannabis palliative uses can check out the new textbook Integrative Oncology, written by the head of San Francisco General Hospitals Oncology and Hematology Department  Dr. Donald Abrams. Patients who want to use cannabis to cure their cancer are entering uncharted territory with few guides.

A Health Department recommendation, obtained by The Associated Press in advance of a final meeting Monday on edible marijuana regulations, suggests a new state commission to give \"pre-market approval\" before food or drinks containing pot can be sold. The recommendation comes a month after the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment suggested banning the sale of most kinds of edible pot. That suggestion was quickly retracted after it went public. Marijuana-infused foods and drinks have been a booming sector in Colorado\\'s new recreational marijuana market. But lawmakers feared the products are too easy to confuse with regular foods and drinks and ordered marijuana regulators to require a new look for marijuana edibles. The new Health Department suggestion calls for a commission to decide which types of foods can be sold. \"The department remains concerned that there are products on the market that so closely resemble children\\'s candy that it can entice children to experiment with marijuana. Marijuana should not seem \\'fun\\' for kids,\" the agency wrote in its recommendation. The ultimate decision on how to change Colorado\\'s edibles market will be made by state lawmakers in 2015. The state\\'s Marijuana Enforcement Division is holding workgroups with industry representatives, law enforcement, health officials and parent groups to come up with a group recommendation to lawmakers on the question. The final workgroup meets Monday. A Health Department spokesman did not respond to a request to comment on the revised suggestion, which hasn\\'t yet been made public. Edible-pot makers fumed at the suggestion, saying it runs afoul of a voter-approved constitutional amendment that guarantees access to retail marijuana in all its forms. State regulations limit potency, serving size and packaging, but there are no regulations on what kinds of foods may contain pot. Edible-pot manufacturers say that limitation would go too far. \"We\\'re governed to death, and people need to take responsibility for themselves,\" said Elyse Gordon, owner of Better Baked, a Denver company that makes edible pot products including teas, energy bars and candies. \"I don\\'t think anyone in the industry is looking to make products for children, and we resent this idea that people aren\\'t responsible for the products they bring into their home.\" Also coming out from the Health Department Monday is a highly anticipated statement about marijuana use by pregnant women and nursing mothers. The agency was tasked by the Legislature to review the health effects of maternal pot use. The preliminary survey to be released Monday says the Health Department found \"limited,\" \\'\\'mixed\" or \"moderate\" evidence for links between maternal use of marijuana during pregnancy and health risks like low birth weight and decreased cognitive function. The agency stopped short of suggesting warning labels on pot about use by pregnant and nursing women, but the Health Department did lay out some \"Public Health Statements\" about maternal pot use. Statements include the fact that marijuana\\'s psychoactive ingredient, THC, can be passed to unborn and nursing babies and that maternal pot use \"is associated with negative effects on exposed children that may not appear until adolescence.\" The agency requests a public-education campaign for moms and better data collection on maternal marijuana use. ___ Kristen Wyatt can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/APkristenwyatt Also on HuffPost: \\u201cBut for almost 20 years now, we\\u2019ve sat back admiring our accomplishment while the world, the nation, and states like Colorado and Washington have passed us by.

Colorado\\'s market for edible marijuana products - pot-infused baked goods, candies, beverages and the like - has been a particular area of concern. The accidental ingestion of edibles by kids has\\xa0received a huge amount of media attention. One widely-reported study found that the number of\\xa0kids under 12 who were admitted to the E.R. for accidental pot ingestion in Colorado jumped from zero to 14 after the state liberalized medical marijuana laws in October 2009. More recently, the Denver Post reported on a \"surge in kids\" accidentally eating pot from 2013 to 2014. Stories like these are a big part of the push for tougher packaging requirements on Colorado\\'s edibles, the Associated Press\\'s Kristen Wyatt reported this weekend. The Colorado Health Department is planning to recommend\\xa0that new edible projects are subject to \"pre-market approval\" by a new commission.\\xa0Previously, the department had recommended a total ban on the sale of edible products, only to hastily withdraw the proposal\\xa0shortly after it was made public. According to the AP, the department wrote that it \"remains concerned that there are products on the market that so closely resemble children\\'s candy that it can entice children to experiment with marijuana.\" These concerns are\\xa0understandable, but they\\'re blown far out of proportion to the actual numbers. Marijuana baked goods have been around for nearly as long as marijuana. And\\xa0marijuana candy has been around for well over a decade, at least. And regardless of the delivery method - whether via edibles or smokes - cases of children being unintentionally exposed to marijuana are vanishingly rare. Let\\'s zoom out to the national picture\\xa0to take a look. The American Association of Poison Control Centers maintains the National Poison Data System, a near-realtime database of literally every call made to a poison control center in the U.S. Their most recent annual report, reflecting data from 2012, allows us to see the number of reported poisoning cases for marijuana, and to compare this to other\\xa0common drugs and household substances, including over the counter painkillers, diaper creams, and contact lens fluid. I\\'ve charted a handful of these below.  What you can see is that for kids 12-and-under, cases of marijuana poisoning are incredibly rare. There were 254 such calls in 2012. By contrast, there were about 1,000 calls related to kids ingesting energy drinks, 1,600 for kids drinking contact lens fluid, and over 4,000 for children who ate birth control pills. Calls for caterpillar stings were twice as common as calls for marijuana exposure, and ingestions of liquid fabric softener were nearly three times as common. Thirty-five thousand\\xa0concerned parents called poison control when their offspring ate diaper creams, nearly 40,000 calls were for ingestion of acetaminophen, and 50,000\\xa0were related solely to\\xa0kids eating too much ibuprofen. Across all substances, the vast majority of cases were for kids 5 and under. These numbers don\\'t tell us about the disposition of these calls - that is, whether parents were told to bring their kids to the hospital, or to just take it easy and put the diaper cream on a higher shelf in the future. They also shouldn\\'t be construed to\\xa0mean that pot is safer for your kids than say, ibuprofen or diaper cream. As a parent of one-year-old twins, I would be much more worried if my kids ate a pot cookie than if they snuck a dab of toothpaste when nobody was looking. The\\xa0numbers are\\xa0partly a function of the fact that ibuprofen and diaper cream are much more common than marijuana in households with small kids. But they suggest that parents who do smoke weed are, generally, doing a pretty good job of keeping it out of kids\\' reach. Even drilling down to the Colorado numbers, let\\'s recall that the most widely-cited study\\xa0unearthed a grand total of\\xa014 kids going to the E.R. for accidental marijuana ingestion between October\\xa02009 and December 2011. That represents about 2.4 percent\\xa0all ingestion-related E.R. visits for that age group over that period. While nobody wants to see a\\xa0kid go to the hospital, every single one of the\\xa014 was sent home, and \"none of these exposures resulted in permanent morbidity or mortality,\" according to the study. These numbers are almost certain to inch up as Colorado\\'s marijuana market matures. Frankly they have nowhere to go but up, as they are almost literally at rock-bottom now. Legalization opponents will continue to use them as fodder for their arguments, and as evidence of the need for tougher regulations. But it\\'s important to keep them in perspective: nationwide, kids are 136 times more likely to be poisoned by their diaper cream than by pot, yet nobody is calling for stricter\\xa0labeling requirements on Desitin.

        " u'By David Downs from the Smell the Truth blog on SFGate.com  New study finds marijuana therapy causes a dramatic reduction glioma brain tumor (shown above) cell lines (via Flickr Griselda Ramirez w CC license) The active molecules in cannabis kill brain cancer  another study has revealed. Scientists using an extract of whole-plant marijuana rich in pots main psychoactive ingredient THC as well as cannabidiol (CBD) showed dramatic reductions in tumor volumes of a type of brain cancer. High-grade glioma is one of the most aggressive cancers in adult humans and long-term survival rates are very low as standard treatments for glioma remain largely unsuccessful, according to researchers Katherine A. Scott, Angus G. Dalgleish, and Wai M. Liu from the Oncology Department at St. Georges University of London. Writing in Molecular Cancer Therapeutics this month, the team recounts how they decided to build on existing research that shows cannabinoids have been shown to specifically inhibit glioma growth as well as neutralize oncogenic processes such as angiogenesis. The researchers wanted to boost the success of cannabinoids, so they investigated using THC and CBD both alone and in combination with radiation in a number of glioma cell lines. Marijuana kills cancer cells in proportion to its dose and duration of treatment, researchers found, and whole plant cannabis rich in THC was more efficacious than pure, lab-grade THC alone. Moreover, pre-treating cells with THC and CBD for four hours prior to irradiation increased the cancer-killing effects of radiation. Scientists think THC and CBD prime cancer cells to commit suicide when exposed to radiation  a process called apoptosis. Related stories on The Pot Blog:    Tumors treated this way in mouse models for glioma showed dramatic results, with pot-treated tumors shrinking to nearly one-tenth the size of tumors in the control group. Taken together, our data highlight the possibility that these cannabinoids can prime glioma cells to respond better to ionizing radiation, and suggest a potential clinical benefit for glioma patients by using these two treatment modalities. The federal government states cannabis is a schedule one drug with no medical benefits and a high potential for abuse. However, 23 states have medical marijuana laws, and untold thousands of patients with untreatable gliomas are turning to cannabis not only for palliative treatment of chemo nausea and pain, but as an adjunctive therapy for treating the cancer itself. Patients who want to learn more about cannabis palliative uses can check out the new textbook Integrative Oncology, written by the head of San Francisco General Hospitals Oncology and Hematology Department  Dr. Donald Abrams. Patients who want to use cannabis to cure their cancer are entering uncharted territory with few guides. Dr. Abrams said most doctors do not know about or understand the bodys endocannabinoid system, which was discovered in the 90s. Americans and their doctors have been terribly and systematically misled about pot for decades, Dr. Sanjay Gupta stated this year.

Nevada is one of a handful of states that permit medical marijuana cardholders from other states to use their cards in Las Vegas and other Sagebrush State cities.(Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) LAS VEGAS \\u2014 Starting early next year, tourists with a medical marijuana card from their home state can buy pot while visiting Las Vegas and other Nevada cities. A handful of other states offer similar reciprocity, including Rhode Island and Maine, but Nevada is the first major tourist-destination state to honor other states\\' systems, industry experts say. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority estimates that nearly 40 million people visit Sin City annually. \"It is a city of recreation, the city that invented the $5,000 bottle of vodka,\" said Derek Peterson, CEO of Terra Tech, which has secured eight Nevada dispensary licenses. \"It\\'s the adult playground in the United States. That\\'s Las Vegas\\' model.\" USA TODAY View where marijuana is legal The decision by state lawmakers to let tourists buy pot legally while visiting Nevada further opens the doors to marijuana tourism across the country. Colorado and Washington state already allow anyone to buy small amounts of pot, and at least one study has shown tourism interest in Colorado has skyrocketed since recreational sales began Jan. 1. Alaska and Oregon in the fall election legalized recreational marijuana sales and use, and Washington, D.C., legalized possession. \"I think it\\'s going to be fantastic for the industry and the visitors,\" said Leslie Bocskor, a marijuana investor and founding chairman of the Nevada Cannabis Industry Association. \"It\\'s a step to treat this just a little more reasonably, to deal with it in a way that makes common sense.\" Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia have versions of medical marijuana programs, under which people with a doctor\\'s recommendation can buy pot to relieve conditions ranging from chronic pain to glaucoma and HIV/AIDS. USA TODAY It\\'s all business at marijuana convention in Vegas Knowing exactly how many Americans have medical marijuana cards is difficult: Some states, such as California, lack a centralized database of users.  Colorado maintains precise numbers, however, with more than 115,000 people possessing medical marijuana cards. Of those, 66% are men, the average age is 42, and 94% of users list severe pain as their reason for using marijuana, according to state statistics. All of those people, however, are violating federal law. And it remains illegal to take marijuana outside the state in which it was bought. In Colorado, TSA security screeners don\\'t specifically look for marijuana, but they will prompt flyers to throw it away if they find it in carry-on bags. USA TODAY Calif. company offering smartphone marijuana deliveries Nevada\\'s law specifies that anyone who presents a medical marijuana card or recommendation will be allowed to buy pot, but lacks any sort of centralized tracking system to check the card\\'s validity. Nevada this fall began issuing licenses to its first medical marijuana stores, which are expected to open sometime in the spring. Industry workers say adults should be trusted to make their own decisions \\u2014 after all, no one on the Vegas strip checks a central federal database before selling alcohol to people from other states. \"A lot of people who are traveling, they may not want to fly with their meds, so there\\'s an attractiveness to the reciprocity,\" Peterson said. \"I don\\'t know it will drive traffic that much, but it\\'s a darn good excuse.\" DENVER (AP) \\u2014 Saying they\\'re still worried that edible pot sweets are too attractive to kids, Colorado health authorities plan to ask Monday for a new panel to decide which marijuana foods and drinks look too much like regular snacks. A Health Department recommendation, obtained by The Associated Press in advance of a final meeting Monday on edible marijuana regulations, suggests a new state commission to give \"pre-market approval\" before food or drinks containing pot can be sold. The recommendation comes a month after the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment suggested banning the sale of most kinds of edible pot. That suggestion was quickly retracted after it went public. Marijuana-infused foods and drinks have been a booming sector in Colorado\\'s new recreational marijuana market. But lawmakers feared the products are too easy to confuse with regular foods and drinks and ordered marijuana regulators to require a new look for marijuana edibles. The new Health Department suggestion calls for a commission to decide which types of foods can be sold. \"The department remains concerned that there are products on the market that so closely resemble children\\'s candy that it can entice children to experiment with marijuana. Marijuana should not seem \\'fun\\' for kids,\" the agency wrote in its recommendation. The ultimate decision on how to change Colorado\\'s edibles market will be made by state lawmakers in 2015. The state\\'s Marijuana Enforcement Division is holding workgroups with industry representatives, law enforcement, health officials and parent groups to come up with a group recommendation to lawmakers on the question. The final workgroup meets Monday. A Health Department spokesman did not respond to a request to comment on the revised suggestion, which hasn\\'t yet been made public. Edible-pot makers fumed at the suggestion, saying it runs afoul of a voter-approved constitutional amendment that guarantees access to retail marijuana in all its forms. State regulations limit potency, serving size and packaging, but there are no regulations on what kinds of foods may contain pot. Edible-pot manufacturers say that limitation would go too far. \"We\\'re governed to death, and people need to take responsibility for themselves,\" said Elyse Gordon, owner of Better Baked, a Denver company that makes edible pot products including teas, energy bars and candies. \"I don\\'t think anyone in the industry is looking to make products for children, and we resent this idea that people aren\\'t responsible for the products they bring into their home.\" Also coming out from the Health Department Monday is a highly anticipated statement about marijuana use by pregnant women and nursing mothers. The agency was tasked by the Legislature to review the health effects of maternal pot use. The preliminary survey to be released Monday says the Health Department found \"limited,\" \\'\\'mixed\" or \"moderate\" evidence for links between maternal use of marijuana during pregnancy and health risks like low birth weight and decreased cognitive function. The agency stopped short of suggesting warning labels on pot about use by pregnant and nursing women, but the Health Department did lay out some \"Public Health Statements\" about maternal pot use. Statements include the fact that marijuana\\'s psychoactive ingredient, THC, can be passed to unborn and nursing babies and that maternal pot use \"is associated with negative effects on exposed children that may not appear until adolescence.\" The agency requests a public-education campaign for moms and better data collection on maternal marijuana use. ___ Kristen Wyatt can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/APkristenwyatt Also on HuffPost: \\u201cBut for almost 20 years now, we\\u2019ve sat back admiring our accomplishment while the world, the nation, and states like Colorado and Washington have passed us by.

We should be protecting and implementing the will of voters, not undermining our democracy by prosecuting small business owners who pay taxes and comply with the laws of their states in providing medicine to patients in need.\" \"Indeed, we view our top priority as creating an environment where negative impacts on children from marijuana legalization are avoided completely.\" \\u201cI didn\\u2019t say I was holier than thou, I said I tried. I never denied that I used marijuana.\" \"If you\\u2019d asked me this question a dozen years ago, it would have been easy to answer -- I would have said no, because [marijuana] leads to other stuff, but I can\\u2019t say that anymore.\" \\u201cI\\u2019m working hard to make sure that Congress passes legislation to respect states and the overwhelming majority that voted to legalize marijuana in 2012.\\u201d \"It was a big week in Colorado. Across the state, recreational marijuana was sold for the first time. And guess what? The world didn\\u2019t end.\" The most\\xa0politically potent arguments against marijuana legalization have focused on the effects of looser marijuana laws on teens and children.\\xa0Opponents say that legalization will lead to increased use among teens (so far it hasn\\'t), and recite the\\xa0drug war mantra that it will \"send the wrong message\" (if so, it appears that kids aren\\'t\\xa0listening). Colorado\\'s market for edible marijuana products - pot-infused baked goods, candies, beverages and the like - has been a particular area of concern. The accidental ingestion of edibles by kids has\\xa0received a huge amount of media attention. One widely-reported study found that the number of\\xa0kids under 12 who were admitted to the E.R. for accidental pot ingestion in Colorado jumped from zero to 14 after the state liberalized medical marijuana laws in October 2009. More recently, the Denver Post reported on a \"surge in kids\" accidentally eating pot from 2013 to 2014. Stories like these are a big part of the push for tougher packaging requirements on Colorado\\'s edibles, the Associated Press\\'s Kristen Wyatt reported this weekend. The Colorado Health Department is planning to recommend\\xa0that new edible projects are subject to \"pre-market approval\" by a new commission.\\xa0Previously, the department had recommended a total ban on the sale of edible products, only to hastily withdraw the proposal\\xa0shortly after it was made public. According to the AP, the department wrote that it \"remains concerned that there are products on the market that so closely resemble children\\'s candy that it can entice children to experiment with marijuana.\" These concerns are\\xa0understandable, but they\\'re blown far out of proportion to the actual numbers.

John Ingold: 303-954-1068, jingold@denverpost.com or twitter.comjohn_ingoldGOLDEN \\u2014 A Colorado task force wrapped up a final task force meeting on Monday with no consensus on what marijuana-infused foods and drinks should look like. The group of regulators, law enforcement, parent groups and edible-pot makers has mostly argued about whether it would be possible to make sure pot products don\\'t look like regular foods. Instead, marijuana regulators decided to send lawmakers several proposals. The state Health Department has called for new markings to go on marijuana products, with a future commission to be set up to pre-approve items what kinds of foods can be made with marijuana. \"We are concerned that the products look enticing to children,\" said Jeff Lawrence, the agency\\'s representative on the workgroup. Some policy makers say edible pot products that can\\'t be easily marked, such as granola or liquids, should simply be banned. \"We always need to keep public safety and public health as the top priority,\" said Mario Vasquez, police chief in Erie and the representative from the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police. But through four long and contentious meetings, the marijuana-industry representatives called those suggestions unworkable and illegal. The voter-approved constitutional amendment legalizing pot makes it legal in all forms, making it doubtful whether a ban on certain kinds of pot candy would be vulnerable to legal challenge. \"At some point the consumer has to take responsibility,\" said Bob Eschino, head of Medically Correct, which makes the popular Incredibles line of marijuana-infused candies. The industry got some support from an unexpected corner \\u2014 the medical community. A representative from Children\\'s Hospital Colorado, Dr. Lilit Bajaj, worries that edible-pot markings could have the opposite effect intended. \"The unintended consequences of marking things could make them more attractive and not less attractive to adolescents,\" Bajaj said. But the author of the edible-pot law, Rep. Jonathan Singer, insisted that marijuana edibles should have an unmistakable look. \"I want to know the difference between a marijuana cookie and a Chips Ahoy just by looking at it,\" said Singer, D-Longmont. The ultimate decision will be made by next year\\'s state Legislature. The law says recreational edible marijuana on store shelves must have a distinct look by 2016. Also Wednesday, the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center released a one-page summary on cases of accidental pot ingestions. The agency reported that calls about children ingesting marijuana have gone up in recent years. The Center got 26 marijuana-related calls last year, up from seven calls in 2001.

        " u'  Colorados first attempt at better regulating edible marijuana products ended in discord Monday when a working group on the issue adjourned without reaching a consensus. Instead, the working group  which had been meeting for months  decided to submit more than a dozen different and often conflicting ideas for new regulations to the legislature, which will re-argue the issue beginning in January. \"Its a wide-open game starting Jan. 7, when we get back in session,\"  state Rep. Jonathan Singer, D-Longmont, said Monday at the conclusion of the working groups final meeting. During this years legislative session, Singer had been one of the sponsors of  the bill that prompted the working group. The bill requires the Department of Revenue  the state agency overseeing marijuana businesses  to come up with rules to limit  accidental ingestion of marijuana-infused edibles.Advertisement \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t    googletag.defineSlot(8013denverpost.comNews,[[300,250]], dfp-EMBEDDED).addService(googletag.pubads()).setTargeting(pos,[Cube_Article]).setTargeting(kv,news);\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t     \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t    googletag.pubads().enableSyncRendering(); \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t    googletag.enableServices();\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t     \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t    googletag.display(dfp-EMBEDDED); \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t     The rules must be in place by 2016, and they will apply only to edibles sold in recreational marijuana stores. Edibles sold in medical-marijuana dispensaries or made at home will not be subject to the rules. \"I wanted to know the difference between a marijuana cookie and a Chips Ahoy! cookie just by looking at it,\" Singer, who sat on the working group, said during Mondays meeting. Ideas for how to do that ranged from better labeling of marijuana edibles to requiring all edibles be a certain color or be stamped with a certain symbol to an outright ban on almost all forms of edible marijuana. But the working groups meetings typically  descended into gridlock, with one group member proposing an idea and another group member arguing it wouldnt work. Mondays meeting, which saw a half-dozen new recommendations added to the pile, followed a similar pattern. The most prominent suggestion came from the state health department, which suggested that Colorado create a commission to approve marijuana edibles before they are allowed to be sold in stores.  The commission would ensure that edibles are identifiable out of their packaging and not appealing to children, according to the proposal. \"The idea would be to ensure that were not putting a noncompliant product in the market,\" said the health departments Jeff Lawrence. But edibles-makers on the working group quickly denounced the idea. Noting that the health department had previously proposed the edibles ban, members wondered who would sit on the panel and how it would decide whats appealing to children. \"It just feels like a veiled way to remove products from the marketplace,\" said Lindsay Topping of Dixie Elixirs. As it adjourned Monday, the working group took no votes on any of the ideas. Instead, the Department of Revenues Ron Kammerzell said all of the groups proposals  as well as all of the groups written comments either supporting or opposing those proposals  would be included in a report to lawmakers. \"We really want to make sure we have a very thorough and thoughtful record of all the issues that have come up here,\" he said. John Ingold: 303-954-1068, jingold@denverpost.com or twitter.comjohn_ingoldGOLDEN \\u2014 A Colorado task force wrapped up a final task force meeting on Monday with no consensus on what marijuana-infused foods and drinks should look like. The group of regulators, law enforcement, parent groups and edible-pot makers has mostly argued about whether it would be possible to make sure pot products don\\'t look like regular foods. Instead, marijuana regulators decided to send lawmakers several proposals. The state Health Department has called for new markings to go on marijuana products, with a future commission to be set up to pre-approve items what kinds of foods can be made with marijuana. \"We are concerned that the products look enticing to children,\" said Jeff Lawrence, the agency\\'s representative on the workgroup. Some policy makers say edible pot products that can\\'t be easily marked, such as granola or liquids, should simply be banned. \"We always need to keep public safety and public health as the top priority,\" said Mario Vasquez, police chief in Erie and the representative from the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police. But through four long and contentious meetings, the marijuana-industry representatives called those suggestions unworkable and illegal. The voter-approved constitutional amendment legalizing pot makes it legal in all forms, making it doubtful whether a ban on certain kinds of pot candy would be vulnerable to legal challenge. \"At some point the consumer has to take responsibility,\" said Bob Eschino, head of Medically Correct, which makes the popular Incredibles line of marijuana-infused candies. The industry got some support from an unexpected corner \\u2014 the medical community. A representative from Children\\'s Hospital Colorado, Dr. Lilit Bajaj, worries that edible-pot markings could have the opposite effect intended. \"The unintended consequences of marking things could make them more attractive and not less attractive to adolescents,\" Bajaj said. But the author of the edible-pot law, Rep. Jonathan Singer, insisted that marijuana edibles should have an unmistakable look. \"I want to know the difference between a marijuana cookie and a Chips Ahoy just by looking at it,\" said Singer, D-Longmont. The ultimate decision will be made by next year\\'s state Legislature. The law says recreational edible marijuana on store shelves must have a distinct look by 2016. Also Wednesday, the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center released a one-page summary on cases of accidental pot ingestions. The agency reported that calls about children ingesting marijuana have gone up in recent years. The Center got 26 marijuana-related calls last year, up from seven calls in 2001. Over the 12-year period, 79 percent of the exposures were in the child\\'s house and 23 percent were admitted to a health care facility. There were no deaths. Marijuana producers have pressed for details on how many of those cases came from store-bought pot, and how many came from homemade items such as pot brownies.

A handful of other states offer similar reciprocity, including Rhode Island and Maine, but Nevada is the first major tourist-destination state to honor other states\\' systems, industry experts say. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority estimates that nearly 40 million people visit Sin City annually. \"It is a city of recreation, the city that invented the $5,000 bottle of vodka,\" said Derek Peterson, CEO of Terra Tech, which has secured eight Nevada dispensary licenses. \"It\\'s the adult playground in the United States. That\\'s Las Vegas\\' model.\" USA TODAY View where marijuana is legal The decision by state lawmakers to let tourists buy pot legally while visiting Nevada further opens the doors to marijuana tourism across the country. Colorado and Washington state already allow anyone to buy small amounts of pot, and at least one study has shown tourism interest in Colorado has skyrocketed since recreational sales began Jan. 1. Alaska and Oregon in the fall election legalized recreational marijuana sales and use, and Washington, D.C., legalized possession. \"I think it\\'s going to be fantastic for the industry and the visitors,\" said Leslie Bocskor, a marijuana investor and founding chairman of the Nevada Cannabis Industry Association. \"It\\'s a step to treat this just a little more reasonably, to deal with it in a way that makes common sense.\" Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia have versions of medical marijuana programs, under which people with a doctor\\'s recommendation can buy pot to relieve conditions ranging from chronic pain to glaucoma and HIV/AIDS. USA TODAY It\\'s all business at marijuana convention in Vegas Knowing exactly how many Americans have medical marijuana cards is difficult: Some states, such as California, lack a centralized database of users.  Colorado maintains precise numbers, however, with more than 115,000 people possessing medical marijuana cards. Of those, 66% are men, the average age is 42, and 94% of users list severe pain as their reason for using marijuana, according to state statistics. All of those people, however, are violating federal law. And it remains illegal to take marijuana outside the state in which it was bought. In Colorado, TSA security screeners don\\'t specifically look for marijuana, but they will prompt flyers to throw it away if they find it in carry-on bags. USA TODAY Calif. company offering smartphone marijuana deliveries Nevada\\'s law specifies that anyone who presents a medical marijuana card or recommendation will be allowed to buy pot, but lacks any sort of centralized tracking system to check the card\\'s validity.

Industry workers say adults should be trusted to make their own decisions \\u2014 after all, no one on the Vegas strip checks a central federal database before selling alcohol to people from other states. \"A lot of people who are traveling, they may not want to fly with their meds, so there\\'s an attractiveness to the reciprocity,\" Peterson said. \"I don\\'t know it will drive traffic that much, but it\\'s a darn good excuse.\" ',\n",
        " 'Updated November 18, 2014 10:42 AM It looks like the use of recreational marijuana is heading down the path of legalization across the country. Voters in Alaska, Oregon and the District of Columbia approved legalizing measures on Nov. 4, but with key differences. The District of Columbia, for instance, will repeal all criminal and civil penalties for personal possession and allow limited, private cultivation of the drug. Oregon on the other hand would give its Liquor Control Commission the power to regulate marijuana as it does alcohol. Some say a profit-driven model for legalization runs the risk of increasing marijuana use, while others argue that a regulated market is the best way to keep use safe for consumers.

        " ' Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., one of the most outspoken Republicans for federal marijuana reform. Download Audio With the passage of Prop. 2 this month, Alaska joins Colorado, Washington, Oregon and the District of Columbia in legalizing marijuana. While the state figures out how to regulate marijuana commerce, several federal laws sit as roadblocks to the business of cannabis. Alaskans who hope to operate marijuana businesses will have to defy U.S. drug law, of course. But theyll also face other federal rules theyre likely to find severely inconvenient and perhaps crippling to their enterprise. One problem is a bit of tax code called 280E. This provision, enacted in the 1980s, prevents narco-traffickers from deducting business expenses, and the IRS enforces it against state-licensed pot businesses, too. Taylor West, deputy director of the Denver-based National Cannabis Industry Association, says it means marijuana businesses cant deduct costs like rent and payroll when they file their tax returns. What that results in is businesses paying an effective tax rate or somewhere around 70-75 even 80 percent on their net profit, she said. Its crushing to small businesses, West says, even though a few legitimate deductions remain. So oddly enough, she said, one of the things that a cannabis dispensary, for instance, can deduct is the cost of buying the marijuana. Another big impediment for pot entrepreneurs is the banking rules.  Banks typically refuse to allow marijuana businesses to open accounts, out of fear that theyll be implicated in money laundering or other federal crimes. West says some members of her industry trade association have found ways around it. But the majority at this point are still having to operate entirely in cash, without the benefit of any sort of safety or accounting ease that comes from having a checking account,she said. Earl Blumenauer, a congressman from Oregon says, regardless of how you feel about legalizing marijuana, its not a good idea to force these businesses out of the banking system. Restricting them from having bank accounts, is absolutely insane, unfair and unwise if you care about money laundering, tax evasion or just theft, he said at a press conference last week at the Capitol. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., one of the most outspoken Republicans for federal marijuana reform. Blumenauer, who represents part of Portland and its eastern suburbs, is pressing for a raft of bills that would ease federal restrictions on marijuana, but the most pressing are the tax code and the banking rules. We need congress to act on two serious problems, not just for those states that have legalized adult use but for 23 states and counting that have legalized medical marijuana, he said. Blumenauer says a coalition of about 180 House Democrats and 50 Republicans supports liberalizing federal marijuana law. One of the visible Republicans is Congressman Dana Rohrabacher of California. My message to my fellow Republicans is Wake up and see where the American people are, Rohrabacher said. Rohrabacher, from conservative Orange County, says Republicans should join him to support principles like personal liberty and limited government, or just raw politics. Alaska Congressman Don Young is already on board. He co-sponsored a Rohrabacher bill to block federal prosecution of people who buy or sell marijuana in compliance with state laws. Spokesman Matt Shuckerow says Young supports a states right to determine the nature of criminal activity within its borders. But one of the biggest impediments to marijuana commerce may be congressional indifference. The leaders of both parties, in the House and the Senate, havent made federal marijuana reform a big priority.  You can subscribe to APRNs newsfeeds via email, podcast and RSS.

But progress has been rolled back beforeits important to remember how we got here if were to keep moving forward.  When I first started writing about drugs in the mid-80sbefore I got into recovery in 1988it was almost impossible to imagine an America where four states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational marijuana use, 58 percent of Florida mid-term voters just cast their ballots in favor of legalizing medical use (the measure needed 60 percent to pass), and California passed a ballot initiative to lower drug and other non-violent crime sentences. (Nineteen other states have legalized medical marijuana.) The magnitude of the change is hard to understand without knowing a bit of recent historyand if we are going to continue to move toward rational drug policy, knowing where weve been and how it has changed is critical. I offer this perspective through the lens of my own experience covering the drug war for nearly 30 years. My first national column was called, embarrassingly enough, Piss Patrol. I was assigned by High Times to write about corporate urine testing policies, starting around 1987, presumably as a service to stoned readers who were considering their employment options. Over the next few years, the media would spill so much ink and airtime demonizing crack cocaine that by 1989, 64 percent of people polled by CBS News said that drugs were the countrys biggest problemand Republicans and Democrats began tripping over one another to race to pass the harshest possible drug sentencing laws. High Times itself was targeted by the DEA with frequent demands for its list of subscribers and raids on all of its biggest advertisers of growing supplies, nearly forcing the magazine to close. Testifying before Congress, the Los Angeled Police Department Chief Daryl Gates said that casual drug users ought to be taken out and shot, and the DARE drug prevention program he founded saw nothing ominous in encouraging kids to turn their parents in to the police if they used drugs. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall warned in a prescient 1989 dissent in a urine testing case that there is no drug exception to the Constitution, although Congress and the rest of the legal establishment apparently begged to differ. Even today, police can confiscate cash and property they suspect to be involved in drug crimes, without convicting the owners and with virtual impunity. The surveillance revelations about the NSAs spying on American citizens include cases where that agency has shared information with the DEA that was gathered from phones and computers without a warrant. In fact, the DEA has an official policy of basically lying to defense attorneysand sometimes even prosecutors and judgesabout the source of this data. Yet even before the rage to pass tough drug laws took off in the 1980s, law enforcement efforts like mandatory minimum sentences were known to be ineffective. The federal government had quietly overturned one set of mandatory drug sentences in the late 60ssince they had clearly failed to prevent the late 60s. And New York City would never have been one of the capitals of crack if the 15-to-life Rockefeller law mandatory sentences for selling even powder cocaine, which had been in place here since the mid-70s, actually suppressed drug use. As is clear from this brief summary, for most of my adult life, the idea of a rational drug policy seemed literally to be a pipe dream (a term, by the way, from opium dens). So how did we go, in just a few years, from seeing drug users as demon enemies in a war who must be locked up to having the drug czar drop the military language and even speak at last months National Harm Reduction Conference in Baltimore? Many factors are clearly playing a role. Two of the most obvious are the sheer economic burden of having become the worlds most prolific jailer and the drop in violent crime that hasnt been paralleled by a fall in addiction rates or a reduction in the availability of drugs like marijuana, heroin, and cocaine. Some of the crime decrease may, of course, be linked to the 500 percent rise in the number of prisoners since 1980but research shows that violent crime fell more in states that have lowered incarceration rates. Other influences have also been important. One has been the increasing recognitiondriven especially by Michelle Alexanders 2011 bestseller The New Jim Crowof the racist nature of the drug war. When you know this history of the drug laws it is very hard to justify supporting them. Another factor is the rise of the Internet. Early adopters of the net tended to be hippies and libertarians: Steve Jobs famously said that his use of LSD was one of the most important experience of his life, for example, and pro-legalization views dominated online before the mainstream media began to realize the Web was the future of its business. This gave legalizers a loud voiceone that had been previously drowned out by a media that had so bought into the drug war that networks and newsmagazines thought nothing of taking government payments to place stories with the correct anti-drug slant in lieu of running paid anti-drug ads. The Internet has also allowed criticsincluding meto directly attack inaccurate coverage as it appeared, exposing readers to truthful information about drugs and drug users that was previously hard to find. It is much harder to start a panic when debunkers immediately offer alternative perspectives. Three other important forces should also be mentioned. First, the Drug Policy Alliancehelped by large donations from billionaire George Sorosspurred activism and funded ballot initiative measures that brought marijuana policy reform out of the fringes and into the mainstream. Second, the harm reduction movement spurred by the AIDS epidemic quietly racked up successes. As it became clear that needle exchange hadnt resulted in a massive increase in IV drug usebut had helped halt the spread of HIVresistance to measures like naloxone to reverse overdose was pre-empted. In contrast to the fight over needle exchange, when conservative politicians, drug treatment providers, and religious leaders actively opposed expansion and claimed, without data, that it would encourage drug use, its actually hard now to find anyone who will argue that drug users and their families should not have access to the OD antidote for fear that preventing the deaths of users sends the wrong message. Third, recovery activists have played a role. While there are still reactionary forces like Patrick Kennedy, many people who have come out about their own recovery have made clear that the criminal justice approach has failed. By putting a real face on drug usersnot a stereotyped image of a criminalrecovering people have begun to help fight against, rather than support, their own oppression. Of course, historically, fights for drug law reform have often resulted in backlashmarijuana was almost legalized, for example, under President Jimmy Carter, but instead we got Ronald Reagans war on drugs. But the strength and variety of the forces working against that possibilityparticularly the rapid access to accurate informationgive me hope that we may finally be starting to get drug policy right.

Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall warned in a prescient 1989 dissent in a urine testing case that there is no drug exception to the Constitution, although Congress and the rest of the legal establishment apparently begged to differ. Even today, police can confiscate cash and property they suspect to be involved in drug crimes, without convicting the owners and with virtual impunity. The surveillance revelations about the NSAs spying on American citizens include cases where that agency has shared information with the DEA that was gathered from phones and computers without a warrant. In fact, the DEA has an official policy of basically lying to defense attorneysand sometimes even prosecutors and judgesabout the source of this data. Yet even before the rage to pass tough drug laws took off in the 1980s, law enforcement efforts like mandatory minimum sentences were known to be ineffective. The federal government had quietly overturned one set of mandatory drug sentences in the late 60ssince they had clearly failed to prevent the late 60s. And New York City would never have been one of the capitals of crack if the 15-to-life Rockefeller law mandatory sentences for selling even powder cocaine, which had been in place here since the mid-70s, actually suppressed drug use. As is clear from this brief summary, for most of my adult life, the idea of a rational drug policy seemed literally to be a pipe dream (a term, by the way, from opium dens). So how did we go, in just a few years, from seeing drug users as demon enemies in a war who must be locked up to having the drug czar drop the military language and even speak at last months National Harm Reduction Conference in Baltimore? Many factors are clearly playing a role. Two of the most obvious are the sheer economic burden of having become the worlds most prolific jailer and the drop in violent crime that hasnt been paralleled by a fall in addiction rates or a reduction in the availability of drugs like marijuana, heroin, and cocaine. Some of the crime decrease may, of course, be linked to the 500 percent rise in the number of prisoners since 1980but research shows that violent crime fell more in states that have lowered incarceration rates. Other influences have also been important. One has been the increasing recognitiondriven especially by Michelle Alexanders 2011 bestseller The New Jim Crowof the racist nature of the drug war. When you know this history of the drug laws it is very hard to justify supporting them. Another factor is the rise of the Internet. Early adopters of the net tended to be hippies and libertarians: Steve Jobs famously said that his use of LSD was one of the most important experience of his life, for example, and pro-legalization views dominated online before the mainstream media began to realize the Web was the future of its business. This gave legalizers a loud voiceone that had been previously drowned out by a media that had so bought into the drug war that networks and newsmagazines thought nothing of taking government payments to place stories with the correct anti-drug slant in lieu of running paid anti-drug ads. The Internet has also allowed criticsincluding meto directly attack inaccurate coverage as it appeared, exposing readers to truthful information about drugs and drug users that was previously hard to find. It is much harder to start a panic when debunkers immediately offer alternative perspectives. Three other important forces should also be mentioned. First, the Drug Policy Alliancehelped by large donations from billionaire George Sorosspurred activism and funded ballot initiative measures that brought marijuana policy reform out of the fringes and into the mainstream. Second, the harm reduction movement spurred by the AIDS epidemic quietly racked up successes. As it became clear that needle exchange hadnt resulted in a massive increase in IV drug usebut had helped halt the spread of HIVresistance to measures like naloxone to reverse overdose was pre-empted. In contrast to the fight over needle exchange, when conservative politicians, drug treatment providers, and religious leaders actively opposed expansion and claimed, without data, that it would encourage drug use, its actually hard now to find anyone who will argue that drug users and their families should not have access to the OD antidote for fear that preventing the deaths of users sends the wrong message. Third, recovery activists have played a role. While there are still reactionary forces like Patrick Kennedy, many people who have come out about their own recovery have made clear that the criminal justice approach has failed. By putting a real face on drug usersnot a stereotyped image of a criminalrecovering people have begun to help fight against, rather than support, their own oppression. Of course, historically, fights for drug law reform have often resulted in backlashmarijuana was almost legalized, for example, under President Jimmy Carter, but instead we got Ronald Reagans war on drugs. But the strength and variety of the forces working against that possibilityparticularly the rapid access to accurate informationgive me hope that we may finally be starting to get drug policy right.

She was joined\\nby three congressmen, including Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), who\\nsaid trying to block legalization in D.C. or in Alaska and Oregon,\\nwhere voters also said no to marijuana prohibition this month,\\nwould flout \"fundamental principles\" that \"Republicans have always\\ntalked about,\" including \"individual liberties,\" \"limited\\ngovernment,\" and \"states\\' rights and the 10th Amendment.\" Anthony  L. Fisher|11.18.14 Jacob Sullum|11.18.14 Jacob Sullum|11.14.14 11.12.14 7:00 am 11.10.14 7:00 am 11.05.14 7:00 am Norton noted that \"we\\'ve had a threat to try to overturn our\\nlegalization initiative.\" She was referring to Rep. Andy Harris\\n(R-Md.), who after the D.C. vote\\xa0told\\xa0The\\nWashington Post, \"I will consider using all resources\\navailable to a member of Congress to stop this action.\" Although\\nthere is no doubting Harris\\'s sincerity, those resources probably\\nwill prove inadequate. Initiative 71, which\\xa0passed\\xa0by\\na margin of more than 2 to 1,\\xa0allows\\xa0adults 21 or\\nolder to possess two ounces or less of marijuana, grow up to six\\nplants at home, and transfer up to an ounce at a time to other\\nadults \"without remuneration.\" It does not authorize commercial\\nproduction or distribution, although the District of Columbia\\nCouncil is considering legislation that would. \"I see no reason why\\nwe wouldn\\'t follow a regime similar to how we regulate and tax\\nalcohol,\" incoming Mayor Muriel Bowser\\xa0said\\xa0at\\na press conference after the election. In theory, there are a couple of ways that Congress could try to\\nstop all this from happening. It could pass a joint resolution\\ndisapproving Initiative 71, or it could bar the District from\\nspending money to implement the measure. But neither of these\\napproaches looks very promising. Initiative 71 cannot take effect until after D.C. Council\\nChairman Phil Mendelson submits it to Congress for review, which he\\nis expected to do when the new Congress is seated in January. \"I\\nwill treat Initiative 71 in the same manner as I would any measure\\npassed by the Council and transmit it to Congress without delay,\"\\nhe\\xa0said\\xa0last\\nweek. Although Mayor-elect Bowser indicated that she would like to\\nwait until the D.C. Council has approved legislation authorizing\\nthe licensing of commercial growers and retailers, the timing is up\\nto Mendelson. Once Mendelson submits the initiative, Congress\\nhas\\xa030\\nlegislative days\\xa0to pass a resolution overriding it. If a\\nresolution is not enacted by the end of that period, the initiative\\nautomatically becomes law. Getting a bill through both chambers in\\nthat amount of time will be a challenge, even with Republicans\\ntaking control of the Senate and expanding their majority in the\\nHouse. And that\\'s assuming Republicans\\u2014who, as Rohrabacher noted,\\noften talk about the virtues of federalism and local control\\u2014think\\nnullifying a policy endorsed by 69 percent of D.C. voters should be\\none of their first acts in the new Congress. \"I think a resolution of disapproval is unlikely,\" says Bill\\nPiper, director of national affairs at the Drug Policy Alliance.\\n\"Overturning a ballot measure passed by 70 percent of the voters\\ndoesn\\'t really look good for the incoming Republican Congress. If\\nthe council transmits [the initiative] in January, I think that\\npretty much reduces or eliminates the chance that Congress will\\noverturn it outright. It just doesn\\'t fit with what they\\'re talking\\nabout doing, which is rebranding themselves as not being\\nobstructionists.\" Nikolas Schiller, communications director at the D.C. Cannabis\\nCampaign, which backed Initiative 71, agrees that Republicans will\\nnot be eager to nix it. \"We believe that a new Republican Congress\\nwill not interfere with something that deals solely with personal\\nliberties,\" he says. Even if the House and the Senate both passed a resolution\\nagainst Initiative 71, it would still need President Obama\\'s\\nsignature. \"The White House is already on record opposing\\ninterference with D.C.\\'s marijuana law,\" Piper notes. Last summer,\\nafter the House Appropriations Committee\\xa0approved\\xa0an\\namendment introduced by Andy Harris that was intended to stop the\\nD.C. Council from decriminalizing marijuana possession, the White\\nHouse\\xa0objected: The Administration strongly opposes the language in the bill\\npreventing the District from using its own local funds to carry out\\nlocally passed marijuana policies, which\\u2026undermines the principles\\nof States\\' rights and of District home rule. Furthermore, the\\nlanguage poses legal challenges to the Metropolitan Police\\nDepartment\\'s enforcement of all marijuana laws currently in force\\nin the District. Strictly speaking, \"states\\' rights\" do not apply to the District\\nof Columbia, which was created by Congress and is subject to much\\nmore extensive federal control than the states are. But as Obama\\nsuggests, the arguments for federalism\\u2014in particular, the idea that\\npolitical decisions should be made at the lowest feasible level to\\nfacilitate citizen influence, policy experimentation, and\\ncompetition among jurisdictions\\u2014apply to D.C. as well as the\\nstates. Given the president\\'s views on the\\xa0subject, it seems\\nreasonable to assume that he would take a dim view of attempts to\\nnullify Initiative 71. Harris\\'s anti-decriminalization amendment, which was omitted\\nfrom the final appropriations bill because of resistance in the\\nSenate, would have prohibited the D.C. Council from spending money\\n\"to enact or carry out any law, rule, or regulation to legalize or\\notherwise reduce penalties associated with the possession, use, or\\ndistribution\" of marijuana or any other Schedule I drug. For more\\nthan a decade, Congress used a similar spending restriction to\\nblock implementation of a medical marijuana initiative that D.C.\\nvoters approved in 1998. If Harris cannot get a resolution of\\ndisapproval overturning Initiative 71, he could try another\\nappropriations rider. Since Republicans will be running the Senate,\\nhe should have a better chance of getting an amendment\\napproved. In practice, however, an appropriations rider would not\\naccomplish much even if it were included in a bill signed into law\\nby the president. Unless Congress is still working on\\nappropriations for the current fiscal year come January, Harris\\nwould have to wait until spending is authorized for fiscal year\\n2016. \"They could do an appropriations rider that might take effect\\nin September, October, November, December,\" Piper says, \"but\\nInitiative 71 will already be in effect by then.\" Since the District already will have eliminated penalties for\\nmarijuana cultivation, possession, and sharing within the limits\\nset by the initiative, telling it not to spend money on doing so\\nwill be ineffectual. There would have been a similar problem if\\nHarris\\'s anti-decriminalization amendment had been enacted this\\nyear, since the appropriations bill to which he tried to attach it\\nwas signed months after possessing up to an ounce of marijuana was\\nchanged from a misdemeanor to a citable offense punishable by a $25\\nfine. A spending restriction enacted toward the end of next year would\\nbe more effective at preventing D.C. from proceeding with plans to\\nlicense and regulate marijuana businesses. The D.C. Council could\\npass a marijuana regulation bill by the middle of 2015, and if it\\nsurvives congressional review it could take effect before Congress\\npasses a new appropriations bill. But legalizing commercial\\nproduction and distribution of marijuana is a process that could\\ntake another year or two, with the first licensed pot shop opening\\nanywhere from the summer of 2016 to the beginning of 2017. There\\nwould be plenty of time for Congress to interfere if it decided to\\ndo so. Will it? The signals are mixed. Harris\\'s anti-decriminalization\\namendment\\xa0passed\\xa0the\\nHouse Appropriations Committee by a mainly party-line vote of 28 to\\n21. The\\xa0spending\\nbill\\xa0including his amendment passed the House by another\\nparty-line\\xa0vote\\xa0of 228\\nto 195 (although voting for the spending bill did not necessarily\\nindicate support for Harris\\'s crusade against decriminalization).\\nNext year there will be 12 more Republican representatives. Then again, this year the House repeatedly voted against federal\\ninterference with marijuana reform. On May 30, 219 members,\\nincluding 49 Republicans,\\xa0voted\\xa0for a\\nRohrabacher amendment telling the Justice Department and the Drug\\nEnforcement Administration not to spend money on efforts to\\nundermine medical marijuana laws. On July 16, 231 members,\\nincluding 45 Republicans,\\xa0approved\\xa0an\\namendment barring the Treasury Department from punishing banks for\\nserving state-licensed marijuana businesses. On the same day, 236\\nmembers, including 46 Republicans,\\xa0rejected\\xa0an\\namendment that would have barred the Justice and Treasury\\ndepartments from implementing guidelines aimed at increasing\\ncannabusinesses\\' access to banking services. All of those votes\\ndealt with D.C. as well as the states. \"I think if there were a vote on the House floor, the momentum\\nwould be on our side,\" Piper says. \"I don\\'t think it would be a\\nslam dunk for Andy Harris.\" Piper adds that when a bill aimed at\\nprotecting medical marijuana laws was introduced in the Senate this\\nyear, there seemed to be at least 50 votes for it. Piper says 60\\nvotes probably would be needed under Senate rules to approve a\\nrider. \"Republicans have picked up some seats,\" he\\xa0says, \"but\\nthe seats they picked up weren\\'t mainly held by progressive\\nDemocrats. So it\\'s not clear to me they have the votes in the\\nSenate.\" One Republican senator is already on record as opposing federal\\ninterference with Initiative 71. \"I think there should be a certain\\namount of discretion for both states and territories and the\\nDistrict,\" Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.)\\xa0told\\xa0reporters\\non Election Day. \"I\\'m not for having the federal government get\\ninvolved. I really haven\\'t taken a stand on\\u2026the actual\\nlegalization\\u2026but I\\'m against the federal government telling them\\nthey can\\'t.\" Paul\\'s views might be influential, especially since he\\nwill be chairing a committee that oversees the District\\'s\\ngovernment. \"If [legalization opponents] went to the Appropriations\\nCommittee,\" Piper says, \"they could avoid Paul, except that he\\nprobably would speak out against such an amendment on the floor and\\nrally the Republicans.\" Another Republican senator, Pat Roberts,\\nwho was re-elected to represent Kansas last week, has\\xa0saidstates\\nshould be free to legalize marijuana, and he may extend the same\\nleeway to D.C. The question for Republicans who have not taken a\\npublic stand on this issue is whether they hate marijuana more than\\nthey love liberty, limited government, and local control.

He\\u2019s says the first step is to determine what he calls \\u201cVermont\\u2019s marijuana landscape.\\u201d That\\u2019s a phrase to estimate how many people currently use marijuana.        The first step is to determine \"Vermont\\'s marijuana landscape,\" an estimate of how many people currently use marijuana.     \\u201cAnd so we\\u2019re able to kind of cobble together information from surveys what we know about misreporting, information we have about total amount consumed, we\\u2019re able to put that together to come up a range,\\u201d said Kilmer. \\u201cSo I\\u2019m optimistic about the future of marijuana market studies.\\u201d Kilmer says establishing a fair price for marijuana products is another critical step because if the price is too high, then the state\\u2019s existing black market for marijuana will continue to thrive. This leads to the question of how to tax marijuana.\\xa0Kilmer\\xa0says imposing a tax based on the weight of the product can have an unintended effect on the potency of the marijuana that is sold here. \\u201cWith that particular model what that does is that it creates incentives for producers to produce more potent pot,\\u201d said\\xa0Kilmer. \\u201cAnd for purchasers to purchase more potent pot.\\u201d        Establishing a fair price for marijuana products is another critical step, says the Rand Corporations\\' Beau Kilmer. If the price is too high, then the state\\'s existing black market for marijuana will continue to thrive.     There\\u2019s also the question of where the marijuana will be sold. Kilmer says the state\\u2019s current system of selling hard alcohol at selected stores isn\\u2019t going to work because the federal government still considers marijuana to be an illegal drug. \\u201cNow if you were to kind of go down the state monopoly road that would have the state forcing their employees to violate federal law,\\u201d said Kilmer. There have been estimates that the state could raise roughly $15 million in new revenue if marijuana is legalized. Kilmer says the Rand report will specifically address this issue by including a detailed analysis of the potential revenue gains for the state. \\n        4 days ago       \\n        4 months ago       View the discussion thread.

As a growing and immature industry we have a lot of work to do to find better methods of providing accurately dosed and tested products to patients in need. Where the current edibles testing situation lacks is in the ability to perform the rigorous testing that is required for food products. These tests are done in in lab settings that are primarily designed to test approximate ratios of plant matter and extracted plant matter. Testing foods requires a far more extensive testing regimen than is able to be provided in current cannabis labs, in our opinion. Most labs that do food testing focus solely on that, and take a lot of time perfecting a process for each type of food product they are testing, whether it be to see if there is the percentage of juice listed on a label or the specified blend of coffee beans in a certain batch. It is unfortunate that in an effort to provide numbers for a dispensary or client in a timely fashion, the testing of edibles becomes very questionable. We work with dozens of dispensary clients throughout the state who share our frustrations. Each has a tale about how their product testing, especially edibles, has been all over the map. As a business operator, it is difficult to have imperfect projections based on a small sampling, done often in rushed conditions, be used as a standard of validity when it is anything but. The industry is just not evolved enough to believe that these independent non-regulated labs that have no oversight or review, and who often share ownership with their clients, can be trusted to provide entirely accurate results. The variation of batch testing from lab to lab, and often even within the same lab on different days, is remarkable. It would almost be humorous if there was not the fact that many medical cannabis provider\\u2019s livelihoods were at stake. As supposed gatekeepers, it is difficult to believe that there is so much allowable variation in process and method. We have done blind testing of our raw materials at several cannabis labs at a time, only to have the results vary wildly. Submitting the same batch of butter or oil to different labs and getting results that could vary from 30-40% makes accurate dosing of edibles a challenge for any producer; and that is just the raw materials. When you get into the actual food substances testing the results are incredibly misleading and inconsistent. A lab tests a sample size of a particular product, and not the entire product. Mixing batches of food is challenging enough to ensure a proper ratio of medicine goes into each product. The methods the labs are putting forth by testing only a very small sample of that food product is impossible to quantify. So imagine if you had a cup of butter that you knew had approximately 4,000 mg of THC in it and you wanted to make cookies where the batch called for 40 pieces, meaning each cookie would have approximately 100mg of THC in them if mixed thoroughly. So mixing that cookie batter to ensure that each of the 40 cookies was adequately dosed would require a thorough mixing. Even with that there is no absolute, so our packages contain the phrase \\u201capp.\\u201d Which is the medical abbreviation for \\u201capproximately,\\u201d and we tell our clients there can be a 15% variation from product to product. Now imagine that a lab takes one of those cookies (that were already challenging enough to ensure approximately 100mg of THC were in each cookie) and broke off just a small piece for testing. Now they are asking you to not only ensure that each cookie has approximately 100mg of THC, but that each 1/100th of a piece of cookie had that exact ratio (app. 1mg). You can see how what is being put forth as accurate testing in that respect is nearly impossible; and that is just a cookie. The same process that is used for cookies is being used for each type of food product, and the same sampling and accurate measurement of the whole product is not reflected in the results. Add to that the evolving methodology of these labs, and the ever changing work load that results in often rushed results to meet a deadline, and you can see how there may be inconsistent and unreliable data being produced. We are in close connection with several labs who do testing for the industry, as well as the dispensaries and providers they serve. We have consistently heard the same complaints throughout. The labs provide a certain aura of responsibility in the political environment, as those who provide cannabis can say \\u201cSee. It was tested by the lab.\\u201d But most industry insiders put very little faith in the actual results provided because they have all experienced strange and bizarre results from any number of labs. Until there is a standard truly third party lab that has the capability to do the type of testing needed for food products, there will continue to be a great fluctuation of results where cannabis foods are concerned. What we know is that we have provided quality, safe, and affordable cannabis food products to thousands of cannabis patients in the state, and have gotten incredible feedback on the consistency and efficacy of our product lines. Until cannabis lab testing is a more reliable resource, in addition to testing our active ingredients with an array of labs, we also do bioassay testing with patients to ensure the products are consistent. We are pleased with the response we have had from the patients we serve. \\xa0Statement from Pete Jr. at Big Pete\\u2019s Treats\\xa0  We slow cook our butter with trim and buds this allows for a wide spectrum of cannabinoids to be extracted. \\xa0We use no butane or hash oil. We are finding that the medicinal properties out much greater with our \\u201cold school\\u201d butter recipes. We test our butter for THC content and know exactly how much butter is in each cookie. As the cookies are in the oven they are losing THC. This is why the THC levels can be lower than stated in the packaging. Big Pete\\u2019s Treats is a family owned business out of Santa Cruz. We always strive to be ahead of the curve and continue to work closely with SC Labs to maintain a consistent dose. You can find us one Twitter, Instagram and Facebook @bigpetestreats Statement from Angela at Medizen: As I checked the end of September I remember exactly what happened with the products (that KPIX picked up.) That was the week I attempted to use a new co2 oil vendor.\\xa0 In the past year that MediZen INC has been alive I have changed oil vendors 4 times! Due to inconsistencies mainly. \\xa0The week of those results I attempted to use a new vendor because our latest vendor has higher prices than I want to pay.\\xa0 I gave another guy a shot at being our supplier and he falsely reported his meds.\\xa0 It happens. How can you trust that someone\\u2019s lab reports are valid before making a purchase other than testing them yourself right?\\xa0 Unfortunately I let that one slip past me. I took his lab reports and parted ways with the hopeful knowledge of its accuracy.\\xa0 A week later I made a drop at the lab and was furious 24 hours later when I saw the lab report come back so low.\\xa0 Everything left from that batch was removed from inventory and the week later I went back to the expensive vendor I trust, and met at the laboratory we use so at least I know he is credible. Since then the lab has provided us with a formula chart to modify our recipe if our vendor\\u2019s product fluctuates.\\xa0 After reopening production everything has improved! It\\u2019s just so unfortunate a handful of bad products got in circulation and this is the result. I now know that this has nothing to do with the lab, although that was my first initial uproar when I received the call.\\xa0 The fault was my own for trusting a new vendor. \\xa0It\\u2019s very sad to say how shady business has become in this industry! Everyone is just trying to lie cheat and steal to win.\\xa0 September 15 I discovered my ex business partner was still using my name and brand without approval and had forged numerous invoices collecting cash I had no knowledge of.\\xa0 I have recently began to recover from the damage as well as the business but I can honestly say in the midst of all the valleys I\\u2019ve been through lately I allowed another snake to cross my path. We are trying to position ourselves ahead of the curve and provide a quality medicine for all our patients.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve spent thousands of dollars at labs modifying recipes and just as much money modifying our labels.\\xa0 We want our consumers to know that MediZen INC is way more than just another edible company; we are patients, and believers of its medical effects too.\\xa0 Be patient with us if you have lost faith.\\xa0\\xa0MediZen INC has had numerous changes all with the intent of doing it the right way and being the best at it.\\xa0\\xa0We are still learning and we are still growing despite all the setbacks.\\xa0\\xa0All I can say is if we had a financial backing like some of these companies we would be the one and only gummy candy in every collective.\\xa0\\xa0There are big brands out there now with millions of dollars and they chose to not do things correctly.\\xa0\\xa0I have shut down productions once to fix potency issues and I will do it as many more times as it takes!\\xa0\\xa0This is beyond me and my employees, the consumers deserve best. \\u2018Vape\\u2019 Becomes Oxford Dictionary Word Of The\\xa0YearReporter Mike Sugerman Puts Bay Area Medicinal Marijuana Dispensary Products To The\\xa0TestKamala Harris Says Legalization Of Marijuana Imminent In\\xa0CaliforniaDriver Allegedly High On Methadone Smashes Car Into Richmond Utility Box, Knocking Power Out For 3,600\\xa0ResidentsStrangest Expense Report Ever: TV Reporter Buys $600 Worth Of Medical Marijuana For\\xa0StoryWhy California Wasn\\u2019t The First State To Legalize Recreational\\xa0Marijuana\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ',\n",

As a growing and immature industry we have a lot of work to do to find better methods of providing accurately dosed and tested products to patients in need. Where the current edibles testing situation lacks is in the ability to perform the rigorous testing that is required for food products. These tests are done in in lab settings that are primarily designed to test approximate ratios of plant matter and extracted plant matter. Testing foods requires a far more extensive testing regimen than is able to be provided in current cannabis labs, in our opinion. Most labs that do food testing focus solely on that, and take a lot of time perfecting a process for each type of food product they are testing, whether it be to see if there is the percentage of juice listed on a label or the specified blend of coffee beans in a certain batch. It is unfortunate that in an effort to provide numbers for a dispensary or client in a timely fashion, the testing of edibles becomes very questionable. We work with dozens of dispensary clients throughout the state who share our frustrations. Each has a tale about how their product testing, especially edibles, has been all over the map. As a business operator, it is difficult to have imperfect projections based on a small sampling, done often in rushed conditions, be used as a standard of validity when it is anything but. The industry is just not evolved enough to believe that these independent non-regulated labs that have no oversight or review, and who often share ownership with their clients, can be trusted to provide entirely accurate results. The variation of batch testing from lab to lab, and often even within the same lab on different days, is remarkable. It would almost be humorous if there was not the fact that many medical cannabis provider\\u2019s livelihoods were at stake. As supposed gatekeepers, it is difficult to believe that there is so much allowable variation in process and method. We have done blind testing of our raw materials at several cannabis labs at a time, only to have the results vary wildly. Submitting the same batch of butter or oil to different labs and getting results that could vary from 30-40% makes accurate dosing of edibles a challenge for any producer; and that is just the raw materials. When you get into the actual food substances testing the results are incredibly misleading and inconsistent. A lab tests a sample size of a particular product, and not the entire product. Mixing batches of food is challenging enough to ensure a proper ratio of medicine goes into each product. The methods the labs are putting forth by testing only a very small sample of that food product is impossible to quantify. So imagine if you had a cup of butter that you knew had approximately 4,000 mg of THC in it and you wanted to make cookies where the batch called for 40 pieces, meaning each cookie would have approximately 100mg of THC in them if mixed thoroughly. So mixing that cookie batter to ensure that each of the 40 cookies was adequately dosed would require a thorough mixing. Even with that there is no absolute, so our packages contain the phrase \\u201capp.\\u201d Which is the medical abbreviation for \\u201capproximately,\\u201d and we tell our clients there can be a 15% variation from product to product. Now imagine that a lab takes one of those cookies (that were already challenging enough to ensure approximately 100mg of THC were in each cookie) and broke off just a small piece for testing. Now they are asking you to not only ensure that each cookie has approximately 100mg of THC, but that each 1/100th of a piece of cookie had that exact ratio (app. 1mg). You can see how what is being put forth as accurate testing in that respect is nearly impossible; and that is just a cookie. The same process that is used for cookies is being used for each type of food product, and the same sampling and accurate measurement of the whole product is not reflected in the results. Add to that the evolving methodology of these labs, and the ever changing work load that results in often rushed results to meet a deadline, and you can see how there may be inconsistent and unreliable data being produced. We are in close connection with several labs who do testing for the industry, as well as the dispensaries and providers they serve. We have consistently heard the same complaints throughout. The labs provide a certain aura of responsibility in the political environment, as those who provide cannabis can say \\u201cSee. It was tested by the lab.\\u201d But most industry insiders put very little faith in the actual results provided because they have all experienced strange and bizarre results from any number of labs. Until there is a standard truly third party lab that has the capability to do the type of testing needed for food products, there will continue to be a great fluctuation of results where cannabis foods are concerned. What we know is that we have provided quality, safe, and affordable cannabis food products to thousands of cannabis patients in the state, and have gotten incredible feedback on the consistency and efficacy of our product lines. Until cannabis lab testing is a more reliable resource, in addition to testing our active ingredients with an array of labs, we also do bioassay testing with patients to ensure the products are consistent. We are pleased with the response we have had from the patients we serve. \\xa0Statement from Pete Jr. at Big Pete\\u2019s Treats\\xa0  We slow cook our butter with trim and buds this allows for a wide spectrum of cannabinoids to be extracted. \\xa0We use no butane or hash oil. We are finding that the medicinal properties out much greater with our \\u201cold school\\u201d butter recipes. We test our butter for THC content and know exactly how much butter is in each cookie. As the cookies are in the oven they are losing THC. This is why the THC levels can be lower than stated in the packaging. Big Pete\\u2019s Treats is a family owned business out of Santa Cruz. We always strive to be ahead of the curve and continue to work closely with SC Labs to maintain a consistent dose. You can find us one Twitter, Instagram and Facebook @bigpetestreats Statement from Angela at Medizen: As I checked the end of September I remember exactly what happened with the products (that KPIX picked up.) That was the week I attempted to use a new co2 oil vendor.\\xa0 In the past year that MediZen INC has been alive I have changed oil vendors 4 times! Due to inconsistencies mainly. \\xa0The week of those results I attempted to use a new vendor because our latest vendor has higher prices than I want to pay.\\xa0 I gave another guy a shot at being our supplier and he falsely reported his meds.\\xa0 It happens. How can you trust that someone\\u2019s lab reports are valid before making a purchase other than testing them yourself right?\\xa0 Unfortunately I let that one slip past me. I took his lab reports and parted ways with the hopeful knowledge of its accuracy.\\xa0 A week later I made a drop at the lab and was furious 24 hours later when I saw the lab report come back so low.\\xa0 Everything left from that batch was removed from inventory and the week later I went back to the expensive vendor I trust, and met at the laboratory we use so at least I know he is credible. Since then the lab has provided us with a formula chart to modify our recipe if our vendor\\u2019s product fluctuates.\\xa0 After reopening production everything has improved! It\\u2019s just so unfortunate a handful of bad products got in circulation and this is the result. I now know that this has nothing to do with the lab, although that was my first initial uproar when I received the call.\\xa0 The fault was my own for trusting a new vendor. \\xa0It\\u2019s very sad to say how shady business has become in this industry! Everyone is just trying to lie cheat and steal to win.\\xa0 September 15 I discovered my ex business partner was still using my name and brand without approval and had forged numerous invoices collecting cash I had no knowledge of.\\xa0 I have recently began to recover from the damage as well as the business but I can honestly say in the midst of all the valleys I\\u2019ve been through lately I allowed another snake to cross my path. We are trying to position ourselves ahead of the curve and provide a quality medicine for all our patients.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve spent thousands of dollars at labs modifying recipes and just as much money modifying our labels.\\xa0 We want our consumers to know that MediZen INC is way more than just another edible company; we are patients, and believers of its medical effects too.\\xa0 Be patient with us if you have lost faith.\\xa0\\xa0MediZen INC has had numerous changes all with the intent of doing it the right way and being the best at it.\\xa0\\xa0We are still learning and we are still growing despite all the setbacks.\\xa0\\xa0All I can say is if we had a financial backing like some of these companies we would be the one and only gummy candy in every collective.\\xa0\\xa0There are big brands out there now with millions of dollars and they chose to not do things correctly.\\xa0\\xa0I have shut down productions once to fix potency issues and I will do it as many more times as it takes!\\xa0\\xa0This is beyond me and my employees, the consumers deserve best. \\u2018Vape\\u2019 Becomes Oxford Dictionary Word Of The\\xa0YearReporter Mike Sugerman Puts Bay Area Medicinal Marijuana Dispensary Products To The\\xa0TestKamala Harris Says Legalization Of Marijuana Imminent In\\xa0CaliforniaDriver Allegedly High On Methadone Smashes Car Into Richmond Utility Box, Knocking Power Out For 3,600\\xa0ResidentsStrangest Expense Report Ever: TV Reporter Buys $600 Worth Of Medical Marijuana For\\xa0StoryWhy California Wasn\\u2019t The First State To Legalize Recreational\\xa0Marijuana\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n A CBS San Francisco reporter just expensed a $600 marijuana buying spree, and the station signed off on it. Reporter Mike Sugerman made the dooby-ious purchase for a report broadcast Monday on KPIX 5. He used his medical marijuana card at Bay Area dispensaries to buy a wide range of products, the potency of which was then tested in a lab. \"They [the bosses] actually were cool with it,\" Sugerman told a fellow KPIX reporter of the unconventional buy.  Sugerman\\'s report revealed that the marijuana edibles he had legally purchased contained far less THC than their labels indicated, and that the smokable marijuana buds were riddled with mold and pesticides. Expensing marijuana may be a sign of the times, but other news outlets covering cannabis are more inclined to bogart the company credit card. In Colorado, which began allowing the sale of recreational marijuana this year, The Denver Post doesn\\'t just hand over a blank check to cannabis critics. Ricardo Baca, who edits the paper\\'s marijuana section, \"The Cannabist,\" told The Huffington Post in an email that reviewers don\\'t have an expense account. \"Our critics\\' weed purchases come out of their freelance, per-article wages -- that\\'s how The Denver Post pays its food and beer freelance journalists, too,\" he said. Oh, and as for the $600 worth of marijuana KPIX put on its tab, Sugerman says the lab kept it all. And while that may sound like a buzzkill for some, it\\'s better than the time Coloradoan reporter Trevor Hughes purchased marijuana for a news segment in January -- when the first recreational weed retailers opened in the state -- then immediately went to the Larimer County Sheriff\\'s Office and had it destroyed. WATCH CBS San Francisco\\'s full report, below: What did Sarah Silverman do to make Katie Couric snort?  Matt Lauer was interviewing a guest on the Today Show when SOMETHING seemed funny.  Megyn Kelly totally lost it over a story about a frozen woman.  This HSN host cracked up when a caller asked her to say hi to her cat on air.  This woman lasted only thirteen seconds into a news segment about farting. It was a gas.  These reporters couldn\\'t stop laughing at footage of a model tripping on the runway, twice.  This anchor laughed so hard that she started crying and insisted, \"I don\\'t know what\\'s wrong with me.\" Apparently, neither did her co-anchor, who asked someone to fill in for her.  All it took for these anchors to crack up? A \"long, stabby thing.\" Another gas story! Anchors should just brace themselves when they have to report on these.  This New Zealand morning show anchor could not stop laughing at the pronunciation of \"Dikshit,\" the last name of the chief minister of Delhi, India. His co-anchor and producers did not appear as amused by his racist leanings.  We\\'re not sure what prompted Emily Oz of WDAY TV to crack up, but it looks fun.  Not only was this anchor laughing uncontrollably -- she had to walk off set.  Anchors on a local Fox news channel couldn\\'t stop laughing during a story about a guy finding a knife in his sandwich.  This anchor lost it over repeated footage of a man biting a snake with a crazed look in his eyes. We commend her for lasting as long as she did without laughing.  Mika Brzezinski collapsed into hysterical fits of laughter on \"Morning Joe\" over a spoof of Dick Cheney. ',\n",
        " u'Updated November 18, 2014 10:42 AM It looks like the use of recreational marijuana is heading down the path of legalization across the country. Voters in Alaska, Oregon and the District of Columbia approved legalizing measures on Nov. 4, but with key differences. The District of Columbia, for instance, will repeal all criminal and civil penalties for personal possession and allow limited, private cultivation of the drug. Oregon on the other hand would give its Liquor Control Commission the power to regulate marijuana as it does alcohol. Some say a profit-driven model for legalization runs the risk of increasing marijuana use, while others argue that a regulated market is the best way to keep use safe for consumers. Whats the right approach to legalizing recreational marijuana?               Mark A. R. Kleiman, co-author, \"Marijuana Legalization: What Everyone Needs to Know\"     \\t\\t Turning cannabis over to for-profit vendors carries two great risks: increased drug abuse, and illegal exports from the district to the rest of the country.

But what are patients really buying when they shop at their local dispensary? Reporter Mike Sugerman conducted a random test. Recently I was sick. Really sick. Life threatening sick. I had bacteria in my aorta. And I had a lot of pills prescribed over that horrible period, including pot. Medicinal marijuana. It helped take away some of the awful, awful pain. Mostly I ate it. And it worked. Sometimes. But sometimes I would get really high. Too high. Sometimes, taking the same amount, I wouldn\\u2019t feel a thing. Didn\\u2019t seem like other drugs, where the same amount had the same effect every time.

As a growing and immature industry we have a lot of work to do to find better methods of providing accurately dosed and tested products to patients in need. Where the current edibles testing situation lacks is in the ability to perform the rigorous testing that is required for food products. These tests are done in in lab settings that are primarily designed to test approximate ratios of plant matter and extracted plant matter. Testing foods requires a far more extensive testing regimen than is able to be provided in current cannabis labs, in our opinion. Most labs that do food testing focus solely on that, and take a lot of time perfecting a process for each type of food product they are testing, whether it be to see if there is the percentage of juice listed on a label or the specified blend of coffee beans in a certain batch. It is unfortunate that in an effort to provide numbers for a dispensary or client in a timely fashion, the testing of edibles becomes very questionable. We work with dozens of dispensary clients throughout the state who share our frustrations. Each has a tale about how their product testing, especially edibles, has been all over the map. As a business operator, it is difficult to have imperfect projections based on a small sampling, done often in rushed conditions, be used as a standard of validity when it is anything but. The industry is just not evolved enough to believe that these independent non-regulated labs that have no oversight or review, and who often share ownership with their clients, can be trusted to provide entirely accurate results. The variation of batch testing from lab to lab, and often even within the same lab on different days, is remarkable. It would almost be humorous if there was not the fact that many medical cannabis provider\\u2019s livelihoods were at stake. As supposed gatekeepers, it is difficult to believe that there is so much allowable variation in process and method. We have done blind testing of our raw materials at several cannabis labs at a time, only to have the results vary wildly. Submitting the same batch of butter or oil to different labs and getting results that could vary from 30-40% makes accurate dosing of edibles a challenge for any producer; and that is just the raw materials. When you get into the actual food substances testing the results are incredibly misleading and inconsistent. A lab tests a sample size of a particular product, and not the entire product. Mixing batches of food is challenging enough to ensure a proper ratio of medicine goes into each product. The methods the labs are putting forth by testing only a very small sample of that food product is impossible to quantify. So imagine if you had a cup of butter that you knew had approximately 4,000 mg of THC in it and you wanted to make cookies where the batch called for 40 pieces, meaning each cookie would have approximately 100mg of THC in them if mixed thoroughly. So mixing that cookie batter to ensure that each of the 40 cookies was adequately dosed would require a thorough mixing. Even with that there is no absolute, so our packages contain the phrase \\u201capp.\\u201d Which is the medical abbreviation for \\u201capproximately,\\u201d and we tell our clients there can be a 15% variation from product to product. Now imagine that a lab takes one of those cookies (that were already challenging enough to ensure approximately 100mg of THC were in each cookie) and broke off just a small piece for testing. Now they are asking you to not only ensure that each cookie has approximately 100mg of THC, but that each 1/100th of a piece of cookie had that exact ratio (app. 1mg). You can see how what is being put forth as accurate testing in that respect is nearly impossible; and that is just a cookie. The same process that is used for cookies is being used for each type of food product, and the same sampling and accurate measurement of the whole product is not reflected in the results. Add to that the evolving methodology of these labs, and the ever changing work load that results in often rushed results to meet a deadline, and you can see how there may be inconsistent and unreliable data being produced. We are in close connection with several labs who do testing for the industry, as well as the dispensaries and providers they serve. We have consistently heard the same complaints throughout. The labs provide a certain aura of responsibility in the political environment, as those who provide cannabis can say \\u201cSee. It was tested by the lab.\\u201d But most industry insiders put very little faith in the actual results provided because they have all experienced strange and bizarre results from any number of labs. Until there is a standard truly third party lab that has the capability to do the type of testing needed for food products, there will continue to be a great fluctuation of results where cannabis foods are concerned. What we know is that we have provided quality, safe, and affordable cannabis food products to thousands of cannabis patients in the state, and have gotten incredible feedback on the consistency and efficacy of our product lines. Until cannabis lab testing is a more reliable resource, in addition to testing our active ingredients with an array of labs, we also do bioassay testing with patients to ensure the products are consistent. We are pleased with the response we have had from the patients we serve. \\xa0Statement from Pete Jr. at Big Pete\\u2019s Treats\\xa0  We slow cook our butter with trim and buds this allows for a wide spectrum of cannabinoids to be extracted. \\xa0We use no butane or hash oil. We are finding that the medicinal properties out much greater with our \\u201cold school\\u201d butter recipes. We test our butter for THC content and know exactly how much butter is in each cookie. As the cookies are in the oven they are losing THC. This is why the THC levels can be lower than stated in the packaging. Big Pete\\u2019s Treats is a family owned business out of Santa Cruz. We always strive to be ahead of the curve and continue to work closely with SC Labs to maintain a consistent dose. You can find us one Twitter, Instagram and Facebook @bigpetestreats Statement from Angela at Medizen: As I checked the end of September I remember exactly what happened with the products (that KPIX picked up.) That was the week I attempted to use a new co2 oil vendor.\\xa0 In the past year that MediZen INC has been alive I have changed oil vendors 4 times! Due to inconsistencies mainly. \\xa0The week of those results I attempted to use a new vendor because our latest vendor has higher prices than I want to pay.\\xa0 I gave another guy a shot at being our supplier and he falsely reported his meds.\\xa0 It happens. How can you trust that someone\\u2019s lab reports are valid before making a purchase other than testing them yourself right?\\xa0 Unfortunately I let that one slip past me. I took his lab reports and parted ways with the hopeful knowledge of its accuracy.\\xa0 A week later I made a drop at the lab and was furious 24 hours later when I saw the lab report come back so low.\\xa0 Everything left from that batch was removed from inventory and the week later I went back to the expensive vendor I trust, and met at the laboratory we use so at least I know he is credible. Since then the lab has provided us with a formula chart to modify our recipe if our vendor\\u2019s product fluctuates.\\xa0 After reopening production everything has improved! It\\u2019s just so unfortunate a handful of bad products got in circulation and this is the result. I now know that this has nothing to do with the lab, although that was my first initial uproar when I received the call.\\xa0 The fault was my own for trusting a new vendor. \\xa0It\\u2019s very sad to say how shady business has become in this industry! Everyone is just trying to lie cheat and steal to win.\\xa0 September 15 I discovered my ex business partner was still using my name and brand without approval and had forged numerous invoices collecting cash I had no knowledge of.\\xa0 I have recently began to recover from the damage as well as the business but I can honestly say in the midst of all the valleys I\\u2019ve been through lately I allowed another snake to cross my path. We are trying to position ourselves ahead of the curve and provide a quality medicine for all our patients.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve spent thousands of dollars at labs modifying recipes and just as much money modifying our labels.\\xa0 We want our consumers to know that MediZen INC is way more than just another edible company; we are patients, and believers of its medical effects too.\\xa0 Be patient with us if you have lost faith.\\xa0\\xa0MediZen INC has had numerous changes all with the intent of doing it the right way and being the best at it.\\xa0\\xa0We are still learning and we are still growing despite all the setbacks.\\xa0\\xa0All I can say is if we had a financial backing like some of these companies we would be the one and only gummy candy in every collective.\\xa0\\xa0There are big brands out there now with millions of dollars and they chose to not do things correctly.\\xa0\\xa0I have shut down productions once to fix potency issues and I will do it as many more times as it takes!\\xa0\\xa0This is beyond me and my employees, the consumers deserve best. \\u2018Vape\\u2019 Becomes Oxford Dictionary Word Of The\\xa0YearReporter Mike Sugerman Puts Bay Area Medicinal Marijuana Dispensary Products To The\\xa0TestKamala Harris Says Legalization Of Marijuana Imminent In\\xa0CaliforniaDriver Allegedly High On Methadone Smashes Car Into Richmond Utility Box, Knocking Power Out For 3,600\\xa0ResidentsStrangest Expense Report Ever: TV Reporter Buys $600 Worth Of Medical Marijuana For\\xa0StoryWhy California Wasn\\u2019t The First State To Legalize Recreational\\xa0Marijuana\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n A CBS San Francisco reporter just expensed a $600 marijuana buying spree, and the station signed off on it. Reporter Mike Sugerman made the dooby-ious purchase for a report broadcast Monday on KPIX 5. He used his medical marijuana card at Bay Area dispensaries to buy a wide range of products, the potency of which was then tested in a lab. \"They [the bosses] actually were cool with it,\" Sugerman told a fellow KPIX reporter of the unconventional buy.  Sugerman\\'s report revealed that the marijuana edibles he had legally purchased contained far less THC than their labels indicated, and that the smokable marijuana buds were riddled with mold and pesticides. Expensing marijuana may be a sign of the times, but other news outlets covering cannabis are more inclined to bogart the company credit card. In Colorado, which began allowing the sale of recreational marijuana this year, The Denver Post doesn\\'t just hand over a blank check to cannabis critics. Ricardo Baca, who edits the paper\\'s marijuana section, \"The Cannabist,\" told The Huffington Post in an email that reviewers don\\'t have an expense account. \"Our critics\\' weed purchases come out of their freelance, per-article wages -- that\\'s how The Denver Post pays its food and beer freelance journalists, too,\" he said. Oh, and as for the $600 worth of marijuana KPIX put on its tab, Sugerman says the lab kept it all. And while that may sound like a buzzkill for some, it\\'s better than the time Coloradoan reporter Trevor Hughes purchased marijuana for a news segment in January -- when the first recreational weed retailers opened in the state -- then immediately went to the Larimer County Sheriff\\'s Office and had it destroyed. WATCH CBS San Francisco\\'s full report, below: What did Sarah Silverman do to make Katie Couric snort?  Matt Lauer was interviewing a guest on the Today Show when SOMETHING seemed funny.  Megyn Kelly totally lost it over a story about a frozen woman.  This HSN host cracked up when a caller asked her to say hi to her cat on air.  This woman lasted only thirteen seconds into a news segment about farting. It was a gas.  These reporters couldn\\'t stop laughing at footage of a model tripping on the runway, twice.  This anchor laughed so hard that she started crying and insisted, \"I don\\'t know what\\'s wrong with me.\" Apparently, neither did her co-anchor, who asked someone to fill in for her.  All it took for these anchors to crack up? A \"long, stabby thing.\" Another gas story! Anchors should just brace themselves when they have to report on these.  This New Zealand morning show anchor could not stop laughing at the pronunciation of \"Dikshit,\" the last name of the chief minister of Delhi, India. His co-anchor and producers did not appear as amused by his racist leanings.  We\\'re not sure what prompted Emily Oz of WDAY TV to crack up, but it looks fun.  Not only was this anchor laughing uncontrollably -- she had to walk off set.  Anchors on a local Fox news channel couldn\\'t stop laughing during a story about a guy finding a knife in his sandwich.  This anchor lost it over repeated footage of a man biting a snake with a crazed look in his eyes. We commend her for lasting as long as she did without laughing.  Mika Brzezinski collapsed into hysterical fits of laughter on \"Morning Joe\" over a spoof of Dick Cheney.

But what are patients really buying when they shop at their local dispensary? Reporter Mike Sugerman conducted a random test. Recently I was sick. Really sick. Life threatening sick. I had bacteria in my aorta. And I had a lot of pills prescribed over that horrible period, including pot. Medicinal marijuana. It helped take away some of the awful, awful pain. Mostly I ate it. And it worked. Sometimes. But sometimes I would get really high. Too high. Sometimes, taking the same amount, I wouldn\\u2019t feel a thing. Didn\\u2019t seem like other drugs, where the same amount had the same effect every time. How come? \\u201cBecause of the federal status of cannabis right now, those federal agencies that do all of that monitoring are not allowed to do it,\\u201d said Don Land. He is a professor of Chemistry at UC Davis, who works with the cannabis industry. There\\u2019s no FDA regulations because the federal government says it\\u2019s illegal to sell or use the drug. \\u201cI \\xa0don\\u2019t buy anything that hasn\\u2019t been tested. I don\\u2019t buy aspirin from someone on a street corner. I go to a pharmacy,\\u201d said Land. READ MORE: Strangest Expense Report Ever Well, I go to legal marijuana dispensaries. Legal in California, anyway. And decided to do the testing myself that the government doesn\\u2019t mandate. To find out what exactly is in the medicine I\\u2019m taking. KPIX 5 reporter Mike Sugerman goes to a dispensary to buy medical marijuana for our test. (CBS) We bought different kinds of items at random at 12 random places in San Francisco and Oakland. We bought $600 worth of flowers, edibles, and what they call shatter, a kind of hash oil. Then we took it to the Steep Hill Labs in Oakland. \\u201cThe science is there, we\\u2019ve been doing this since 2008, we were the first,\\xa0 we\\u2019ve developed very advanced methodologies,\\u201d said David Lampach, the CEO of Steep Hill. Steep Hill Labs is among the national leaders in testing. Used by California dispensaries which really want to know what they\\u2019re selling. You\\u2019ve got to be careful. Steep Hill Labs in Oakland. (CBS) Some say they are testing, but Don Land said: \\u201cWe have run into that where someone is in the back making numbers up, and putting them up in front, and we showed them they were very wrong.\\u201d Protocols here very different to say the least. And the results? \\u201cAll the edibles missed their mark,\\u201d said Dr. Kymron Decesare, chief research officer at Steep Hill. He told me nothing I was taking had anything to do with what was on the label.\\u201d The one that was the worst claimed to be 100 milligrams, it was 1.3. That was the Edipure brand.\\xa0That\\u2019s 98.7% off. Most others were only half the strength they claimed, or a quarter. Even gummy bears and lozenges in the same pack had great variations from one piece to another. Even more disturbing, what they found in the buds that people smoke. Mold. And pesticides. 40% of the samples couldn\\u2019t be sold in Colorado or Washington where there are limits. Decesare told us mold can be dangerous: \\u201cEven if there are no microtoxins in mold, there are potentially deadly molds like penicillin or aspergillums, deadly toxins that could kill people.\\u201d Mold found in a medical marijuana sample. (CBS) And 15% of the hash oil had benzene, which is not approved for use in the human body. Bottom line? \\u201cSo when I take this stuff, smoke it, whatever, I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m getting?\\u201d I asked him.

As a growing and immature industry we have a lot of work to do to find better methods of providing accurately dosed and tested products to patients in need. Where the current edibles testing situation lacks is in the ability to perform the rigorous testing that is required for food products. These tests are done in in lab settings that are primarily designed to test approximate ratios of plant matter and extracted plant matter. Testing foods requires a far more extensive testing regimen than is able to be provided in current cannabis labs, in our opinion. Most labs that do food testing focus solely on that, and take a lot of time perfecting a process for each type of food product they are testing, whether it be to see if there is the percentage of juice listed on a label or the specified blend of coffee beans in a certain batch. It is unfortunate that in an effort to provide numbers for a dispensary or client in a timely fashion, the testing of edibles becomes very questionable. We work with dozens of dispensary clients throughout the state who share our frustrations. Each has a tale about how their product testing, especially edibles, has been all over the map. As a business operator, it is difficult to have imperfect projections based on a small sampling, done often in rushed conditions, be used as a standard of validity when it is anything but. The industry is just not evolved enough to believe that these independent non-regulated labs that have no oversight or review, and who often share ownership with their clients, can be trusted to provide entirely accurate results. The variation of batch testing from lab to lab, and often even within the same lab on different days, is remarkable. It would almost be humorous if there was not the fact that many medical cannabis provider\\u2019s livelihoods were at stake. As supposed gatekeepers, it is difficult to believe that there is so much allowable variation in process and method. We have done blind testing of our raw materials at several cannabis labs at a time, only to have the results vary wildly. Submitting the same batch of butter or oil to different labs and getting results that could vary from 30-40% makes accurate dosing of edibles a challenge for any producer; and that is just the raw materials. When you get into the actual food substances testing the results are incredibly misleading and inconsistent. A lab tests a sample size of a particular product, and not the entire product. Mixing batches of food is challenging enough to ensure a proper ratio of medicine goes into each product. The methods the labs are putting forth by testing only a very small sample of that food product is impossible to quantify. So imagine if you had a cup of butter that you knew had approximately 4,000 mg of THC in it and you wanted to make cookies where the batch called for 40 pieces, meaning each cookie would have approximately 100mg of THC in them if mixed thoroughly. So mixing that cookie batter to ensure that each of the 40 cookies was adequately dosed would require a thorough mixing. Even with that there is no absolute, so our packages contain the phrase \\u201capp.\\u201d Which is the medical abbreviation for \\u201capproximately,\\u201d and we tell our clients there can be a 15% variation from product to product. Now imagine that a lab takes one of those cookies (that were already challenging enough to ensure approximately 100mg of THC were in each cookie) and broke off just a small piece for testing. Now they are asking you to not only ensure that each cookie has approximately 100mg of THC, but that each 1/100th of a piece of cookie had that exact ratio (app. 1mg). You can see how what is being put forth as accurate testing in that respect is nearly impossible; and that is just a cookie. The same process that is used for cookies is being used for each type of food product, and the same sampling and accurate measurement of the whole product is not reflected in the results. Add to that the evolving methodology of these labs, and the ever changing work load that results in often rushed results to meet a deadline, and you can see how there may be inconsistent and unreliable data being produced. We are in close connection with several labs who do testing for the industry, as well as the dispensaries and providers they serve. We have consistently heard the same complaints throughout. The labs provide a certain aura of responsibility in the political environment, as those who provide cannabis can say \\u201cSee. It was tested by the lab.\\u201d But most industry insiders put very little faith in the actual results provided because they have all experienced strange and bizarre results from any number of labs. Until there is a standard truly third party lab that has the capability to do the type of testing needed for food products, there will continue to be a great fluctuation of results where cannabis foods are concerned. What we know is that we have provided quality, safe, and affordable cannabis food products to thousands of cannabis patients in the state, and have gotten incredible feedback on the consistency and efficacy of our product lines. Until cannabis lab testing is a more reliable resource, in addition to testing our active ingredients with an array of labs, we also do bioassay testing with patients to ensure the products are consistent. We are pleased with the response we have had from the patients we serve. \\xa0Statement from Pete Jr. at Big Pete\\u2019s Treats\\xa0  We slow cook our butter with trim and buds this allows for a wide spectrum of cannabinoids to be extracted. \\xa0We use no butane or hash oil. We are finding that the medicinal properties out much greater with our \\u201cold school\\u201d butter recipes. We test our butter for THC content and know exactly how much butter is in each cookie. As the cookies are in the oven they are losing THC. This is why the THC levels can be lower than stated in the packaging. Big Pete\\u2019s Treats is a family owned business out of Santa Cruz.

That was the week I attempted to use a new co2 oil vendor.\\xa0 In the past year that MediZen INC has been alive I have changed oil vendors 4 times! Due to inconsistencies mainly. \\xa0The week of those results I attempted to use a new vendor because our latest vendor has higher prices than I want to pay.\\xa0 I gave another guy a shot at being our supplier and he falsely reported his meds.\\xa0 It happens. How can you trust that someone\\u2019s lab reports are valid before making a purchase other than testing them yourself right?\\xa0 Unfortunately I let that one slip past me. I took his lab reports and parted ways with the hopeful knowledge of its accuracy.\\xa0 A week later I made a drop at the lab and was furious 24 hours later when I saw the lab report come back so low.\\xa0 Everything left from that batch was removed from inventory and the week later I went back to the expensive vendor I trust, and met at the laboratory we use so at least I know he is credible. Since then the lab has provided us with a formula chart to modify our recipe if our vendor\\u2019s product fluctuates.\\xa0 After reopening production everything has improved! It\\u2019s just so unfortunate a handful of bad products got in circulation and this is the result. I now know that this has nothing to do with the lab, although that was my first initial uproar when I received the call.\\xa0 The fault was my own for trusting a new vendor. \\xa0It\\u2019s very sad to say how shady business has become in this industry! Everyone is just trying to lie cheat and steal to win.\\xa0 September 15 I discovered my ex business partner was still using my name and brand without approval and had forged numerous invoices collecting cash I had no knowledge of.\\xa0 I have recently began to recover from the damage as well as the business but I can honestly say in the midst of all the valleys I\\u2019ve been through lately I allowed another snake to cross my path. We are trying to position ourselves ahead of the curve and provide a quality medicine for all our patients.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve spent thousands of dollars at labs modifying recipes and just as much money modifying our labels.\\xa0 We want our consumers to know that MediZen INC is way more than just another edible company; we are patients, and believers of its medical effects too.\\xa0 Be patient with us if you have lost faith.\\xa0\\xa0MediZen INC has had numerous changes all with the intent of doing it the right way and being the best at it.\\xa0\\xa0We are still learning and we are still growing despite all the setbacks.\\xa0\\xa0All I can say is if we had a financial backing like some of these companies we would be the one and only gummy candy in every collective.\\xa0\\xa0There are big brands out there now with millions of dollars and they chose to not do things correctly.\\xa0\\xa0I have shut down productions once to fix potency issues and I will do it as many more times as it takes!\\xa0\\xa0This is beyond me and my employees, the consumers deserve best. \\u2018Vape\\u2019 Becomes Oxford Dictionary Word Of The\\xa0YearReporter Mike Sugerman Puts Bay Area Medicinal Marijuana Dispensary Products To The\\xa0TestKamala Harris Says Legalization Of Marijuana Imminent In\\xa0CaliforniaDriver Allegedly High On Methadone Smashes Car Into Richmond Utility Box, Knocking Power Out For 3,600\\xa0ResidentsStrangest Expense Report Ever: TV Reporter Buys $600 Worth Of Medical Marijuana For\\xa0StoryWhy California Wasn\\u2019t The First State To Legalize Recreational\\xa0Marijuana\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ',\n",
        " u'Updated November 18, 2014 10:42 AM It looks like the use of recreational marijuana is heading down the path of legalization across the country. Voters in Alaska, Oregon and the District of Columbia approved legalizing measures on Nov. 4, but with key differences. The District of Columbia, for instance, will repeal all criminal and civil penalties for personal possession and allow limited, private cultivation of the drug. Oregon on the other hand would give its Liquor Control Commission the power to regulate marijuana as it does alcohol. Some say a profit-driven model for legalization runs the risk of increasing marijuana use, while others argue that a regulated market is the best way to keep use safe for consumers. Whats the right approach to legalizing recreational marijuana?               Mark A. R. Kleiman, co-author, \"Marijuana Legalization: What Everyone Needs to Know\"     \\t\\t Turning cannabis over to for-profit vendors carries two great risks: increased drug abuse, and illegal exports from the district to the rest of the country.                Malik Burnett, Drug Policy Alliance     \\t\\t Revenues generated from the taxation of marijuana should be reinvested in the communities most harmed by the war on drugs.

But what are patients really buying when they shop at their local dispensary? Reporter Mike Sugerman conducted a random test. Recently I was sick. Really sick. Life threatening sick. I had bacteria in my aorta. And I had a lot of pills prescribed over that horrible period, including pot. Medicinal marijuana. It helped take away some of the awful, awful pain. Mostly I ate it. And it worked. Sometimes. But sometimes I would get really high. Too high. Sometimes, taking the same amount, I wouldn\\u2019t feel a thing. Didn\\u2019t seem like other drugs, where the same amount had the same effect every time. How come? \\u201cBecause of the federal status of cannabis right now, those federal agencies that do all of that monitoring are not allowed to do it,\\u201d said Don Land. He is a professor of Chemistry at UC Davis, who works with the cannabis industry. There\\u2019s no FDA regulations because the federal government says it\\u2019s illegal to sell or use the drug. \\u201cI \\xa0don\\u2019t buy anything that hasn\\u2019t been tested. I don\\u2019t buy aspirin from someone on a street corner. I go to a pharmacy,\\u201d said Land. READ MORE: Strangest Expense Report Ever Well, I go to legal marijuana dispensaries. Legal in California, anyway. And decided to do the testing myself that the government doesn\\u2019t mandate. To find out what exactly is in the medicine I\\u2019m taking. KPIX 5 reporter Mike Sugerman goes to a dispensary to buy medical marijuana for our test. (CBS) We bought different kinds of items at random at 12 random places in San Francisco and Oakland. We bought $600 worth of flowers, edibles, and what they call shatter, a kind of hash oil. Then we took it to the Steep Hill Labs in Oakland. \\u201cThe science is there, we\\u2019ve been doing this since 2008, we were the first,\\xa0 we\\u2019ve developed very advanced methodologies,\\u201d said David Lampach, the CEO of Steep Hill. Steep Hill Labs is among the national leaders in testing. Used by California dispensaries which really want to know what they\\u2019re selling. You\\u2019ve got to be careful. Steep Hill Labs in Oakland. (CBS) Some say they are testing, but Don Land said: \\u201cWe have run into that where someone is in the back making numbers up, and putting them up in front, and we showed them they were very wrong.\\u201d Protocols here very different to say the least. And the results? \\u201cAll the edibles missed their mark,\\u201d said Dr. Kymron Decesare, chief research officer at Steep Hill. He told me nothing I was taking had anything to do with what was on the label.\\u201d The one that was the worst claimed to be 100 milligrams, it was 1.3. That was the Edipure brand.\\xa0That\\u2019s 98.7% off. Most others were only half the strength they claimed, or a quarter. Even gummy bears and lozenges in the same pack had great variations from one piece to another. Even more disturbing, what they found in the buds that people smoke. Mold. And pesticides. 40% of the samples couldn\\u2019t be sold in Colorado or Washington where there are limits. Decesare told us mold can be dangerous: \\u201cEven if there are no microtoxins in mold, there are potentially deadly molds like penicillin or aspergillums, deadly toxins that could kill people.\\u201d Mold found in a medical marijuana sample. (CBS) And 15% of the hash oil had benzene, which is not approved for use in the human body. Bottom line? \\u201cSo when I take this stuff, smoke it, whatever, I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m getting?\\u201d I asked him.

These tests are done in in lab settings that are primarily designed to test approximate ratios of plant matter and extracted plant matter. Testing foods requires a far more extensive testing regimen than is able to be provided in current cannabis labs, in our opinion. Most labs that do food testing focus solely on that, and take a lot of time perfecting a process for each type of food product they are testing, whether it be to see if there is the percentage of juice listed on a label or the specified blend of coffee beans in a certain batch. It is unfortunate that in an effort to provide numbers for a dispensary or client in a timely fashion, the testing of edibles becomes very questionable. We work with dozens of dispensary clients throughout the state who share our frustrations. Each has a tale about how their product testing, especially edibles, has been all over the map. As a business operator, it is difficult to have imperfect projections based on a small sampling, done often in rushed conditions, be used as a standard of validity when it is anything but. The industry is just not evolved enough to believe that these independent non-regulated labs that have no oversight or review, and who often share ownership with their clients, can be trusted to provide entirely accurate results. The variation of batch testing from lab to lab, and often even within the same lab on different days, is remarkable. It would almost be humorous if there was not the fact that many medical cannabis provider\\u2019s livelihoods were at stake. As supposed gatekeepers, it is difficult to believe that there is so much allowable variation in process and method. We have done blind testing of our raw materials at several cannabis labs at a time, only to have the results vary wildly. Submitting the same batch of butter or oil to different labs and getting results that could vary from 30-40% makes accurate dosing of edibles a challenge for any producer; and that is just the raw materials. When you get into the actual food substances testing the results are incredibly misleading and inconsistent. A lab tests a sample size of a particular product, and not the entire product. Mixing batches of food is challenging enough to ensure a proper ratio of medicine goes into each product. The methods the labs are putting forth by testing only a very small sample of that food product is impossible to quantify. So imagine if you had a cup of butter that you knew had approximately 4,000 mg of THC in it and you wanted to make cookies where the batch called for 40 pieces, meaning each cookie would have approximately 100mg of THC in them if mixed thoroughly. So mixing that cookie batter to ensure that each of the 40 cookies was adequately dosed would require a thorough mixing. Even with that there is no absolute, so our packages contain the phrase \\u201capp.\\u201d Which is the medical abbreviation for \\u201capproximately,\\u201d and we tell our clients there can be a 15% variation from product to product. Now imagine that a lab takes one of those cookies (that were already challenging enough to ensure approximately 100mg of THC were in each cookie) and broke off just a small piece for testing. Now they are asking you to not only ensure that each cookie has approximately 100mg of THC, but that each 1/100th of a piece of cookie had that exact ratio (app. 1mg). You can see how what is being put forth as accurate testing in that respect is nearly impossible; and that is just a cookie. The same process that is used for cookies is being used for each type of food product, and the same sampling and accurate measurement of the whole product is not reflected in the results. Add to that the evolving methodology of these labs, and the ever changing work load that results in often rushed results to meet a deadline, and you can see how there may be inconsistent and unreliable data being produced. We are in close connection with several labs who do testing for the industry, as well as the dispensaries and providers they serve. We have consistently heard the same complaints throughout. The labs provide a certain aura of responsibility in the political environment, as those who provide cannabis can say \\u201cSee. It was tested by the lab.\\u201d But most industry insiders put very little faith in the actual results provided because they have all experienced strange and bizarre results from any number of labs. Until there is a standard truly third party lab that has the capability to do the type of testing needed for food products, there will continue to be a great fluctuation of results where cannabis foods are concerned.

Reporter Mike Sugerman made the dooby-ious purchase for a report broadcast Monday on KPIX 5. He used his medical marijuana card at Bay Area dispensaries to buy a wide range of products, the potency of which was then tested in a lab. \"They [the bosses] actually were cool with it,\" Sugerman told a fellow KPIX reporter of the unconventional buy.  Sugerman\\'s report revealed that the marijuana edibles he had legally purchased contained far less THC than their labels indicated, and that the smokable marijuana buds were riddled with mold and pesticides. Expensing marijuana may be a sign of the times, but other news outlets covering cannabis are more inclined to bogart the company credit card. In Colorado, which began allowing the sale of recreational marijuana this year, The Denver Post doesn\\'t just hand over a blank check to cannabis critics. Ricardo Baca, who edits the paper\\'s marijuana section, \"The Cannabist,\" told The Huffington Post in an email that reviewers don\\'t have an expense account. \"Our critics\\' weed purchases come out of their freelance, per-article wages -- that\\'s how The Denver Post pays its food and beer freelance journalists, too,\" he said. Oh, and as for the $600 worth of marijuana KPIX put on its tab, Sugerman says the lab kept it all. And while that may sound like a buzzkill for some, it\\'s better than the time Coloradoan reporter Trevor Hughes purchased marijuana for a news segment in January -- when the first recreational weed retailers opened in the state -- then immediately went to the Larimer County Sheriff\\'s Office and had it destroyed. WATCH CBS San Francisco\\'s full report, below: What did Sarah Silverman do to make Katie Couric snort?  Matt Lauer was interviewing a guest on the Today Show when SOMETHING seemed funny.  Megyn Kelly totally lost it over a story about a frozen woman.  This HSN host cracked up when a caller asked her to say hi to her cat on air.  This woman lasted only thirteen seconds into a news segment about farting. It was a gas.  These reporters couldn\\'t stop laughing at footage of a model tripping on the runway, twice.  This anchor laughed so hard that she started crying and insisted, \"I don\\'t know what\\'s wrong with me.\" Apparently, neither did her co-anchor, who asked someone to fill in for her.  All it took for these anchors to crack up? A \"long, stabby thing.\" Another gas story! Anchors should just brace themselves when they have to report on these.  This New Zealand morning show anchor could not stop laughing at the pronunciation of \"Dikshit,\" the last name of the chief minister of Delhi, India. His co-anchor and producers did not appear as amused by his racist leanings.  We\\'re not sure what prompted Emily Oz of WDAY TV to crack up, but it looks fun.  Not only was this anchor laughing uncontrollably -- she had to walk off set.  Anchors on a local Fox news channel couldn\\'t stop laughing during a story about a guy finding a knife in his sandwich.  This anchor lost it over repeated footage of a man biting a snake with a crazed look in his eyes. We commend her for lasting as long as she did without laughing.  Mika Brzezinski collapsed into hysterical fits of laughter on \"Morning Joe\" over a spoof of Dick Cheney.

But what are patients really buying when they shop at their local dispensary? Reporter Mike Sugerman conducted a random test. Recently I was sick. Really sick. Life threatening sick. I had bacteria in my aorta. And I had a lot of pills prescribed over that horrible period, including pot. Medicinal marijuana. It helped take away some of the awful, awful pain. Mostly I ate it. And it worked. Sometimes. But sometimes I would get really high. Too high. Sometimes, taking the same amount, I wouldn\\u2019t feel a thing. Didn\\u2019t seem like other drugs, where the same amount had the same effect every time. How come? \\u201cBecause of the federal status of cannabis right now, those federal agencies that do all of that monitoring are not allowed to do it,\\u201d said Don Land. He is a professor of Chemistry at UC Davis, who works with the cannabis industry. There\\u2019s no FDA regulations because the federal government says it\\u2019s illegal to sell or use the drug. \\u201cI \\xa0don\\u2019t buy anything that hasn\\u2019t been tested. I don\\u2019t buy aspirin from someone on a street corner. I go to a pharmacy,\\u201d said Land. READ MORE: Strangest Expense Report Ever Well, I go to legal marijuana dispensaries. Legal in California, anyway. And decided to do the testing myself that the government doesn\\u2019t mandate. To find out what exactly is in the medicine I\\u2019m taking. KPIX 5 reporter Mike Sugerman goes to a dispensary to buy medical marijuana for our test. (CBS) We bought different kinds of items at random at 12 random places in San Francisco and Oakland. We bought $600 worth of flowers, edibles, and what they call shatter, a kind of hash oil. Then we took it to the Steep Hill Labs in Oakland. \\u201cThe science is there, we\\u2019ve been doing this since 2008, we were the first,\\xa0 we\\u2019ve developed very advanced methodologies,\\u201d said David Lampach, the CEO of Steep Hill. Steep Hill Labs is among the national leaders in testing. Used by California dispensaries which really want to know what they\\u2019re selling. You\\u2019ve got to be careful. Steep Hill Labs in Oakland. (CBS) Some say they are testing, but Don Land said: \\u201cWe have run into that where someone is in the back making numbers up, and putting them up in front, and we showed them they were very wrong.\\u201d Protocols here very different to say the least. And the results? \\u201cAll the edibles missed their mark,\\u201d said Dr. Kymron Decesare, chief research officer at Steep Hill. He told me nothing I was taking had anything to do with what was on the label.\\u201d The one that was the worst claimed to be 100 milligrams, it was 1.3. That was the Edipure brand.\\xa0That\\u2019s 98.7% off. Most others were only half the strength they claimed, or a quarter. Even gummy bears and lozenges in the same pack had great variations from one piece to another. Even more disturbing, what they found in the buds that people smoke. Mold. And pesticides. 40% of the samples couldn\\u2019t be sold in Colorado or Washington where there are limits. Decesare told us mold can be dangerous: \\u201cEven if there are no microtoxins in mold, there are potentially deadly molds like penicillin or aspergillums, deadly toxins that could kill people.\\u201d Mold found in a medical marijuana sample. (CBS) And 15% of the hash oil had benzene, which is not approved for use in the human body. Bottom line? \\u201cSo when I take this stuff, smoke it, whatever, I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m getting?\\u201d I asked him. Decesare\\u2019s response: \\u201cYou don\\u2019t know what you\\u2019re getting.\\u201d I wish I did. It\\u2019s my medicine. And if it really is medicine, shouldn\\u2019t it be regulated? That\\u2019s up to the politicians.

Bidding took place under a black tent fronted by tall heaters, and the event was monitored by at least two representatives of the Washington Liquor Control Board. Bidders could smell plastic bags of buds before offering a bid.  The marijuana was planted in May and harvested between late September and mid-October. Fireweed Farms owner Randy Williams had sold some of his marijuana to recreational processors earlier this year, but the auction represented the bulk of his harvest.  He said he held the auction to get rid of it all quick so he could spend time with his grandson instead of packaging marijuana. The harvested and dried marijuana was priced by the gram and auctioned by the strain in lots ranging from about half a pound to 5 pounds.  Williams said he planned to donate proceeds from three lots, totaling $14,000, to local schools.  Lt. Jeremy Wissing, an officer with the state Liquor Control Board who monitored a portion of Saturdays auction, said it appeared to be well run.  Im seeing a well-organized event, Wissing said outside the Fireweed Farms grow area. It isnt a circus. Im not seeing open consumption of marijuana.  Williams initially hoped to make $1 million through the marijuana fire sale, but said during the auction that hed be happy with $600,000 or $700,000.  Although Saturdays auction was the states first, Wissing doesnt expect it to be the last.  Its just a different way of moving his product, Wissing said.  The auction attracted about three dozen potential buyers from across the state.  Nazareth Victoria, a 50-year-old licensed marijuana processor from Seattle, left empty-handed. He came because he was interested in seeing what was available, but ultimately wasnt sure about the quality, he said.  I was just interested in the whole process, Victoria said. To me, smoking the product is the ultimate test to tell you the quality.  Sampling the product was strictly forbidden Saturday.  This is a controlled business environment, Wissing said.

        " u'Cancel Set    Washington states first marijuana auction brought in about $600,000.  Fireweed Farms of Prosser sold about 300 pounds of pot to state-licensed processors and retailers Saturday, the Tri-City Herald reported ( http:is.gdJsJp6T ). Bidding took place under a black tent fronted by tall heaters, and the event was monitored by at least two representatives of the Washington Liquor Control Board. Bidders could smell plastic bags of buds before offering a bid.  The marijuana was planted in May and harvested between late September and mid-October. Fireweed Farms owner Randy Williams had sold some of his marijuana to recreational processors earlier this year, but the auction represented the bulk of his harvest.  He said he held the auction to \"get rid of it all quick\" so he could spend time with his grandson instead of packaging marijuana. The harvested and dried marijuana was priced by the gram and auctioned by the strain in lots ranging from about half a pound to five pounds.  Williams said he planned to donate proceeds from three lots, totaling $14,000, to local schools.  Lt. Jeremy Wissing, an officer with the state Liquor Control Board who monitored a portion of Saturdays auction, said it appeared to be well run.  \"Im seeing a well-organized event,\" Wissing said outside the Fireweed Farms grow area. \"It isnt a circus. Im not seeing open consumption of marijuana.\"  Williams initially hoped to make $1 million through the marijuana fire sale, but said during the auction that hed be happy with $600,000 or $700,000.  The purchased marijuana was to remain under video-monitored quarantine at Fireweed Farms overnight Saturday, Wissing said. Buyers could either retrieve their marijuana Sunday or arrange for it to be delivered to their business by Williams.  Although Saturdays auction was the states first, Wissing doesnt expect it to be the last.  \"Its just a different way of moving his product,\" Wissing said.  Interest in the marijuana auction was so intense that Williams commissioned the use of a parking lot across the street from his property to accommodate the visitors.  Buyers were provided with a detailed list of strains and lot sizes that provided a complete potency profile, labeling requirements and the date the batch was tested by Confidence Analytics, a state-certified laboratory. The auction attracted about three dozen potential buyers from across the state.  Nazareth Victoria, a 50-year-old licensed marijuana processor from Seattle, left empty-handed. He came because he was interested in seeing what was available, but ultimately wasnt sure about the quality, he said.  \"I was just interested in the whole process,\" Victoria said. \"To me, smoking the product is the ultimate test to tell you the quality.\"  Sampling the product was strictly forbidden Saturday.  \"This is a controlled business environment,\" Wissing said.

California Attorney General Kamala Harris says she is \"not opposed\" to legalizing marijuana, but stopped short of endorsing efforts to do so in the Golden State.  With legal recreational marijuana use fully underway in Colorado and Washington -- and similar programs on the horizon in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C. -- advocates are hoping to bring a legalization initiative to the California ballot in 2016. Medical marijuana has been legal in the state since 1996, but recreational use is still prohibited.  In an interview Monday with BuzzFeed, Harris said that while she has no \"moral opposition\" to the substance, she has concerns over the law enforcement implications of legalizing it:  \"I am not opposed to the legalization of marijuana. I\\'m the top cop, and so I have to look at it from a law enforcement perspective and a public safety perspective,\\u201d Harris told BuzzFeed News in an interview in Washington, D.C. \\u201cI think we are fortunate to have Colorado and Washington be in front of us on this and figuring out the details of what it looks like when it\\u2019s legalized.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\'re watching it happen right before our eyes in Colorado and Washington. I don\\'t think it\\u2019s gonna take too long to figure this out,\\u201d Harris said. \\u201cI think there\\'s a certain inevitability about it.\" Read the full BuzzFeed interview here. Earlier this month, Harris was elected to a second term, defeating pro-weed Republican Ron Gold. During the campaign, Harris largely evaded the issue, saying it should be left to voters to decide. (Recent polls have indicated that California voters support legalizing recreational pot.) While California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) remains tepid on legal pot, the issue has found a champion in Lt. Gov Gavin Newsom, who has said he would back a legalization ballot measure in 2016. Harris, however, told BuzzFeed she feels it would be \"irresponsible\" for her to make a similar endorsement.  \\u201cIt would be easier for me to say, \\'Let\\u2019s legalize it, let\\u2019s move on,\\' and everybody would be happy. I believe that would be irresponsible of me as the top cop,\" she said.   Harris, seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party, has already been floated as a potential replacement for California Sen. Barbara Boxer (D), who is rumored to be leaning towards retiring after her term ends in 2016. She was also eyed as a potential replacement for outgoing U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, but said she had no interest in the role. \"I am focused on key public safety issues including transnational gangs, truancy and recidivism,\" Harris said in a statement about the speculation.  Also on HuffPost: Despite the help they got on the campaign trail, candidates with family political legacies did not fare well Tuesday.\\n\\nGeorgia state Sen. Jason Carter (D), the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, lost in his bid for the state\\u2019s governorship. Democrat Michelle Nunn, the daughter of former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), lost in Georgia\\u2019s Senate race.\\n\\nSen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) had assistance from his mother and father, former U.S. Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.), during his re-election campaign. Yet he lost his seat to Rep. Tom Cotton (R). And Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) moved on to a runoff instead of winning re-election outright, despite being the daughter of former New Orleans Mayor Moon Landrieu (D).\\n\\nPerhaps the brightest spot for political offspring on Tuesday was a win for Gwen Graham, the daughter of former U.S. Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.). She defeated incumbent Rep. Steve Southerland in Florida\\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. Even before Election Day, voters in Texas were having trouble casting ballots because of a new state voter ID law that the Supreme Court allowed to stand. And on Election Day the reports of voters being turned away continued.\\n\\nThe Texas law, which Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called an \\u201cunconstitutional poll tax\\u201d in her October dissent to the court\\'s decision, requires voters to provide one of seven types of photo ID in order to vote. Concealed handgun licenses are valid, but college IDs are not. The law\\u2019s strict provisions have led civil rights groups to argue it was designed to hamper turnout from minorities and young people, who tend to vote Democratic.\\n\\nTexas isn\\u2019t the only place new laws were implemented. In all, 14 states are navigating new rules related to voting.  Rep. Steve Southerland (R-Fla.) was the first incumbent House representative to lose on Tuesday night, falling to Democratic challenger Gwen Graham in a race in which the congressman\\'s comments about women became a major point of contention.\\n\\nIn September, Southerland came under fire for a men-only fundraiser his campaign had held earlier in the year. An invitation to the event told invited members to \"tell the misses not to wait up.\" When Graham\\'s campaign made issue of the fundraiser, Southerland replied by likening it to a \"lingerie party.\"\\n\\nThe back and forth led Democrats with Graham\\'s campaign to charge that Southerland was partaking in the so-called \"war on women,\" and the congressman later faced attacks for his vote against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. For Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.), winning a third term was as easy as taking candy from a baby.\\n\\nVote tallies on election night showed Grimm with more than a 10-point lead over his challenger, Democrat Dominic Recchia, even though the congressman is facing a host of federal tax fraud charges and earlier this year was caught on tape threatening to break a TV reporter \"in half.\"\\n\\nGrimm will face trial in February for 20 counts of mail and tax fraud relating to a restaurant he once owned, the New York Observer reports. Sweeping immigration reform was dealt another blow Tuesday as Republicans took control of the U.S. Senate. With control of both chambers, the GOP could pass an immigration reform bill on its own terms, in hopes it would boost the party\\u2019s standing with Latinos for the 2016 elections. If that were to happen, President Barack Obama would probably feel inclined to sign the bill. However, it\\u2019s unlikely to encompass all the changes reform groups -- and Democrats -- have been pushing for.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Obama has said he plans to pursue reform through executive action after the elections regardless, so Congress\\u2019 unwillingness to address the issue might not prevent it from happening. It\\u2019s hard to prove whether campaign tactics of fear won an election for any candidate, but it\\u2019s clear plenty of campaigns were cultivating fear about Ebola, the Islamic State and immigration, yet didn\\u2019t suffer any major retribution.\\n\\nEven a GOP candidate who used an image from an Islamic State beheading in his campaign ad was polling within 15 percentage points of Sen. Tom Udall shortly before Election Day. Even before Election Day, Maine\\u2019s independent gubernatorial candidate, Eliot Cutler, told supporters to vote their conscience when he was running behind in the polls. The statement served as a signal that he knew he wasn\\u2019t going to win, even though he wasn\\u2019t dropping out of the race.\\n\\nKansas independent Senate candidate Greg Orman, however, was in a tight race with unpopular GOP incumbent Sen. Pat Roberts as voters went to the polls Tuesday. However, he couldn\\u2019t pull out a win. Abortion rights were upheld Tuesday as two \\u201cpersonhood\\u201d amendments on state ballots were rejected. \\n\\nNorth Dakota rejected Measure 1, which would have added a statement to the state constitution that declared, \\u201cThe inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and protected.\\u201d Coloradans rejected Amendment 67 on their ballot. The measure would have included fetuses in the state\\u2019s criminal code where the words \\u201cperson\\u201d or \\u201cchild\\u201d were used. The state\\u2019s voters have turned down personhood measures in the past.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Tennessee\\u2019s Amendment 1, which passed in the red state, declares that the state constitution doesn\\u2019t protect a woman\\u2019s right to an abortion or the funding of abortions. This doesn\\u2019t bode well for Democratic presidential hopefuls: In recent presidential elections with no incumbent, the party that controls Congress has taken the White House.\\n\\nPresident Barack Obama was elected in 2008, while Democrats controlled both chambers. When George W. Bush was elected in 2000, the GOP had the House and Senate. Democrats ran Congress in 1992, when Bill Clinton won the presidency.\\n\\nBut not all hope is lost. GOP Presidents George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon and Dwight Eisenhower all won while Democrats controlled Congress. Measures to raise the minimum wage were on the ballot in five states Tuesday. In four Republican-leaning states -- Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota -- voters considered binding measures to enact hikes, while in Illinois, the referendum was only advisory. \\n\\nVoters in Alaska approved a measure to raise the minimum wage to $9.75 from its current $7.75. In Nebraska, a similar push to hike the hourly wage to $9 from the federal minimum of $7.25 also passed. And in Arkansas and South Dakota, which both currently use the federal minimum wage, voters decided to change the minimum wage to $8.50 an hour. The non-binding referendum in Illinois to raise the minimum wage to $10, from the current statewide $8.25, won as well. \\n\\nFirst and foremost, this is a win for the low-wage workers who will see more take-home pay next year. But there have been ongoing disputes over the potential long-term effects of wage increases, with some economists suggesting that they will lead to lost jobs and make it harder for low-skilled workers to find work. Others have said the overall effects on the job market will be negligible. FiveThirtyEight has a more complete analysis on how these hikes could affect the workforces in various states.\\n\\nPolitically, however, this could be a sign that Obama\\'s campaign to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 is an increasingly popular issue that plays well in elections -- perhaps particularly for Democrats, who have stood behind the president\\'s push. While a number of GOP candidates from the states that voted on minimum wage measures eventually announced support for those initiatives, Republicans in Congress have consistently resisted similar nationwide efforts. Going into the 2014 election cycle, there were exactly zero admitted atheists serving in Congress. That didn\\'t change on Tuesday night, as the most viable candidate, James Woods, a blind Democrat running in a deeply red congressional district in Arizona, failed to pull off an upset against longtime GOP Rep. Matt Salmon.\\n\\nVarious areligious groups have claimed in the past that there are a number of congressional representatives who don\\'t believe in God. At this point, however, they remain unwilling to express such views in public.  Voters on Tuesday told the \\u201ckissing congressman\\u201d not to return to Congress. \\n\\nRep. Vance McAllister (R-La.), who was caught on tape with a married former employee earlier this year, said a couple of weeks after the video surfaced that he wouldn\\u2019t run for re-election. However, two months later, he re-entered the race. \\n\\nIn the end, voters decided to give someone else a shot at his seat. Although the race will go to a runoff, McAllister will not be on the ballot. Just five Senate races received half of all dark money spending -- funds whose sources don\\u2019t have to be disclosed under federal rules -- in the 2014 cycle. The majority of the money supported the GOP candidates -- and all five of those Republicans won.\\n\\n$92.8 million of the $190 million in dark money spent in the cycle went toward Senate races in Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Kentucky and North Carolina\\n\\nAs of mid-October, super PACs spent $29.2 million against Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), and she lost to Thom Tillis (R). More than $18 million went to support Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R), who won in Kentucky. Some $14.1 million was spent against Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.), who lost to Rep. Cory Gardner (R). In Arkansas, $10.4 million was spent against Sen. Mark Pryor (D), who lost to Rep. Tom Cotton (R).\\n\\nIn Alaska, $11.7 million in dark money was spent, with $6.6 million backing the winner, Republican Dan Sullivan, and $5.1 million backing Sen. Mark Begich (D).  Martha Coakley in Massachusetts, Charlie Crist in Florida, Scott Brown in whichever state he\\u2019s currently in \\u2026 all lost once in high-profile statewide races, and then came back this cycle to lose again.\\n\\nBrown has made history with his losses to women, though. After the passage of some state initiatives Tuesday night, recreational marijuana is on track to be legal in at least three states and Washington, D.C.\\n\\nOregon\\u2019s Initiative Petition 53, which passed, would allow adults 21 and over to possess up to 8 ounces of marijuana at home and 1 ounce when in public. Initiative 71 in D.C. also passed and would allow adults to possess up to 2 ounces and grow up to six plants for personal use. Marijuana sales would still be illegal in D.C., however.\\n\\nAlaska voters approved Ballot Measure 2, which would allow adults 21 and over to possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana and grow up to six plants for their own use. Marijuana paraphernalia could also legally be made and sold. \\n\\nColorado and Washington were the first states to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012. Medical marijuana is legal in 23 states and D.C., though an amendment to legalize it in Florida on Tuesday was just shy of the 60 percent approval that was required for passage.\\n\\nPoliticians in other states have already been talking about proposing legalization in the coming years. Voters in Washington state on Tuesday approved a ballot measure to require background checks on all gun sales. It was one of two gun-related initiatives, with a competing proposal that would have prevented the state from imposing additional background check requirements unless first enacted by the federal government. The passage of this ballot measure comes more than 18 months after Congress rejected a federal background check measure proposed in the wake of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, despite polls showing that about 90 percent of Americans supported the policy at the time. With politicians at both the state and national levels having shown little interest in gun control legislation in the period since, this small victory could suggest to proponents that their best chances of success are with voters.\\n\\nThe issue of guns was also on the ballot in Alabama, where voters passed an amendment to declare that every citizen \"has a fundamental right to bear arms and that any restriction on this right would be subject to strict scrutiny.\" At any rate, Alabama is a deep red state, and it seemed unlikely legislators would have moved aggressively on any sort of gun control measure in the first place. Tuesday wasn\\u2019t a good night for the Clintons, whose endorsed candidates largely failed to pull off wins across the country. Shushannah Walshe of ABC News noted their tallies on Twitter:\\n\\n\"How did @hillaryclinton do? She stumped for 26 candidates, 10 wins, 14 losses, @ABC has not projected 1 race, and she backed  Landrieu.\" Walshe tweeted.\\n\\nShe followed it with: \"And how did @billclinton do? Out of 41 candidates,  10 wins, 21 losses, Mary Landrieu will go to a run off & @ABC has not projected 10 races.\"\\n\\nThat said, many are expecting Hillary to focus on becoming a winner between now and 2016.

        " u'Cancel Set    Washington states first marijuana auction brought in about $600,000.  Fireweed Farms of Prosser sold about 300 pounds of pot to state-licensed processors and retailers Saturday, the Tri-City Herald reported ( http:is.gdJsJp6T ). Bidding took place under a black tent fronted by tall heaters, and the event was monitored by at least two representatives of the Washington Liquor Control Board. Bidders could smell plastic bags of buds before offering a bid.  The marijuana was planted in May and harvested between late September and mid-October. Fireweed Farms owner Randy Williams had sold some of his marijuana to recreational processors earlier this year, but the auction represented the bulk of his harvest.  He said he held the auction to \"get rid of it all quick\" so he could spend time with his grandson instead of packaging marijuana. The harvested and dried marijuana was priced by the gram and auctioned by the strain in lots ranging from about half a pound to five pounds.  Williams said he planned to donate proceeds from three lots, totaling $14,000, to local schools.  Lt. Jeremy Wissing, an officer with the state Liquor Control Board who monitored a portion of Saturdays auction, said it appeared to be well run.  \"Im seeing a well-organized event,\" Wissing said outside the Fireweed Farms grow area. \"It isnt a circus. Im not seeing open consumption of marijuana.\"  Williams initially hoped to make $1 million through the marijuana fire sale, but said during the auction that hed be happy with $600,000 or $700,000.  The purchased marijuana was to remain under video-monitored quarantine at Fireweed Farms overnight Saturday, Wissing said. Buyers could either retrieve their marijuana Sunday or arrange for it to be delivered to their business by Williams.  Although Saturdays auction was the states first, Wissing doesnt expect it to be the last.  \"Its just a different way of moving his product,\" Wissing said.  Interest in the marijuana auction was so intense that Williams commissioned the use of a parking lot across the street from his property to accommodate the visitors.  Buyers were provided with a detailed list of strains and lot sizes that provided a complete potency profile, labeling requirements and the date the batch was tested by Confidence Analytics, a state-certified laboratory. The auction attracted about three dozen potential buyers from across the state.  Nazareth Victoria, a 50-year-old licensed marijuana processor from Seattle, left empty-handed. He came because he was interested in seeing what was available, but ultimately wasnt sure about the quality, he said.  \"I was just interested in the whole process,\" Victoria said. \"To me, smoking the product is the ultimate test to tell you the quality.\"  Sampling the product was strictly forbidden Saturday.  \"This is a controlled business environment,\" Wissing said.

California Attorney General Kamala Harris says she is \"not opposed\" to legalizing marijuana, but stopped short of endorsing efforts to do so in the Golden State.  With legal recreational marijuana use fully underway in Colorado and Washington -- and similar programs on the horizon in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C. -- advocates are hoping to bring a legalization initiative to the California ballot in 2016. Medical marijuana has been legal in the state since 1996, but recreational use is still prohibited.  In an interview Monday with BuzzFeed, Harris said that while she has no \"moral opposition\" to the substance, she has concerns over the law enforcement implications of legalizing it:  \"I am not opposed to the legalization of marijuana. I\\'m the top cop, and so I have to look at it from a law enforcement perspective and a public safety perspective,\\u201d Harris told BuzzFeed News in an interview in Washington, D.C. \\u201cI think we are fortunate to have Colorado and Washington be in front of us on this and figuring out the details of what it looks like when it\\u2019s legalized.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\'re watching it happen right before our eyes in Colorado and Washington. I don\\'t think it\\u2019s gonna take too long to figure this out,\\u201d Harris said. \\u201cI think there\\'s a certain inevitability about it.\" Read the full BuzzFeed interview here. Earlier this month, Harris was elected to a second term, defeating pro-weed Republican Ron Gold. During the campaign, Harris largely evaded the issue, saying it should be left to voters to decide. (Recent polls have indicated that California voters support legalizing recreational pot.) While California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) remains tepid on legal pot, the issue has found a champion in Lt. Gov Gavin Newsom, who has said he would back a legalization ballot measure in 2016. Harris, however, told BuzzFeed she feels it would be \"irresponsible\" for her to make a similar endorsement.  \\u201cIt would be easier for me to say, \\'Let\\u2019s legalize it, let\\u2019s move on,\\' and everybody would be happy. I believe that would be irresponsible of me as the top cop,\" she said.   Harris, seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party, has already been floated as a potential replacement for California Sen. Barbara Boxer (D), who is rumored to be leaning towards retiring after her term ends in 2016. She was also eyed as a potential replacement for outgoing U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, but said she had no interest in the role. \"I am focused on key public safety issues including transnational gangs, truancy and recidivism,\" Harris said in a statement about the speculation.  Also on HuffPost: Despite the help they got on the campaign trail, candidates with family political legacies did not fare well Tuesday.\\n\\nGeorgia state Sen. Jason Carter (D), the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, lost in his bid for the state\\u2019s governorship. Democrat Michelle Nunn, the daughter of former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), lost in Georgia\\u2019s Senate race.\\n\\nSen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) had assistance from his mother and father, former U.S. Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.), during his re-election campaign. Yet he lost his seat to Rep. Tom Cotton (R). And Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) moved on to a runoff instead of winning re-election outright, despite being the daughter of former New Orleans Mayor Moon Landrieu (D).\\n\\nPerhaps the brightest spot for political offspring on Tuesday was a win for Gwen Graham, the daughter of former U.S. Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.). She defeated incumbent Rep. Steve Southerland in Florida\\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. Even before Election Day, voters in Texas were having trouble casting ballots because of a new state voter ID law that the Supreme Court allowed to stand. And on Election Day the reports of voters being turned away continued.\\n\\nThe Texas law, which Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called an \\u201cunconstitutional poll tax\\u201d in her October dissent to the court\\'s decision, requires voters to provide one of seven types of photo ID in order to vote. Concealed handgun licenses are valid, but college IDs are not. The law\\u2019s strict provisions have led civil rights groups to argue it was designed to hamper turnout from minorities and young people, who tend to vote Democratic.\\n\\nTexas isn\\u2019t the only place new laws were implemented. In all, 14 states are navigating new rules related to voting.  Rep. Steve Southerland (R-Fla.) was the first incumbent House representative to lose on Tuesday night, falling to Democratic challenger Gwen Graham in a race in which the congressman\\'s comments about women became a major point of contention.\\n\\nIn September, Southerland came under fire for a men-only fundraiser his campaign had held earlier in the year. An invitation to the event told invited members to \"tell the misses not to wait up.\" When Graham\\'s campaign made issue of the fundraiser, Southerland replied by likening it to a \"lingerie party.\"\\n\\nThe back and forth led Democrats with Graham\\'s campaign to charge that Southerland was partaking in the so-called \"war on women,\" and the congressman later faced attacks for his vote against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. For Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.), winning a third term was as easy as taking candy from a baby.\\n\\nVote tallies on election night showed Grimm with more than a 10-point lead over his challenger, Democrat Dominic Recchia, even though the congressman is facing a host of federal tax fraud charges and earlier this year was caught on tape threatening to break a TV reporter \"in half.\"\\n\\nGrimm will face trial in February for 20 counts of mail and tax fraud relating to a restaurant he once owned, the New York Observer reports. Sweeping immigration reform was dealt another blow Tuesday as Republicans took control of the U.S. Senate. With control of both chambers, the GOP could pass an immigration reform bill on its own terms, in hopes it would boost the party\\u2019s standing with Latinos for the 2016 elections. If that were to happen, President Barack Obama would probably feel inclined to sign the bill. However, it\\u2019s unlikely to encompass all the changes reform groups -- and Democrats -- have been pushing for.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Obama has said he plans to pursue reform through executive action after the elections regardless, so Congress\\u2019 unwillingness to address the issue might not prevent it from happening. It\\u2019s hard to prove whether campaign tactics of fear won an election for any candidate, but it\\u2019s clear plenty of campaigns were cultivating fear about Ebola, the Islamic State and immigration, yet didn\\u2019t suffer any major retribution.\\n\\nEven a GOP candidate who used an image from an Islamic State beheading in his campaign ad was polling within 15 percentage points of Sen. Tom Udall shortly before Election Day. Even before Election Day, Maine\\u2019s independent gubernatorial candidate, Eliot Cutler, told supporters to vote their conscience when he was running behind in the polls. The statement served as a signal that he knew he wasn\\u2019t going to win, even though he wasn\\u2019t dropping out of the race.\\n\\nKansas independent Senate candidate Greg Orman, however, was in a tight race with unpopular GOP incumbent Sen. Pat Roberts as voters went to the polls Tuesday. However, he couldn\\u2019t pull out a win. Abortion rights were upheld Tuesday as two \\u201cpersonhood\\u201d amendments on state ballots were rejected. \\n\\nNorth Dakota rejected Measure 1, which would have added a statement to the state constitution that declared, \\u201cThe inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and protected.\\u201d Coloradans rejected Amendment 67 on their ballot. The measure would have included fetuses in the state\\u2019s criminal code where the words \\u201cperson\\u201d or \\u201cchild\\u201d were used. The state\\u2019s voters have turned down personhood measures in the past.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Tennessee\\u2019s Amendment 1, which passed in the red state, declares that the state constitution doesn\\u2019t protect a woman\\u2019s right to an abortion or the funding of abortions. This doesn\\u2019t bode well for Democratic presidential hopefuls: In recent presidential elections with no incumbent, the party that controls Congress has taken the White House.\\n\\nPresident Barack Obama was elected in 2008, while Democrats controlled both chambers. When George W. Bush was elected in 2000, the GOP had the House and Senate. Democrats ran Congress in 1992, when Bill Clinton won the presidency.\\n\\nBut not all hope is lost. GOP Presidents George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon and Dwight Eisenhower all won while Democrats controlled Congress. Measures to raise the minimum wage were on the ballot in five states Tuesday. In four Republican-leaning states -- Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota -- voters considered binding measures to enact hikes, while in Illinois, the referendum was only advisory. \\n\\nVoters in Alaska approved a measure to raise the minimum wage to $9.75 from its current $7.75. In Nebraska, a similar push to hike the hourly wage to $9 from the federal minimum of $7.25 also passed. And in Arkansas and South Dakota, which both currently use the federal minimum wage, voters decided to change the minimum wage to $8.50 an hour. The non-binding referendum in Illinois to raise the minimum wage to $10, from the current statewide $8.25, won as well. \\n\\nFirst and foremost, this is a win for the low-wage workers who will see more take-home pay next year. But there have been ongoing disputes over the potential long-term effects of wage increases, with some economists suggesting that they will lead to lost jobs and make it harder for low-skilled workers to find work. Others have said the overall effects on the job market will be negligible. FiveThirtyEight has a more complete analysis on how these hikes could affect the workforces in various states.\\n\\nPolitically, however, this could be a sign that Obama\\'s campaign to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 is an increasingly popular issue that plays well in elections -- perhaps particularly for Democrats, who have stood behind the president\\'s push. While a number of GOP candidates from the states that voted on minimum wage measures eventually announced support for those initiatives, Republicans in Congress have consistently resisted similar nationwide efforts. Going into the 2014 election cycle, there were exactly zero admitted atheists serving in Congress. That didn\\'t change on Tuesday night, as the most viable candidate, James Woods, a blind Democrat running in a deeply red congressional district in Arizona, failed to pull off an upset against longtime GOP Rep. Matt Salmon.\\n\\nVarious areligious groups have claimed in the past that there are a number of congressional representatives who don\\'t believe in God. At this point, however, they remain unwilling to express such views in public.  Voters on Tuesday told the \\u201ckissing congressman\\u201d not to return to Congress. \\n\\nRep. Vance McAllister (R-La.), who was caught on tape with a married former employee earlier this year, said a couple of weeks after the video surfaced that he wouldn\\u2019t run for re-election. However, two months later, he re-entered the race. \\n\\nIn the end, voters decided to give someone else a shot at his seat. Although the race will go to a runoff, McAllister will not be on the ballot. Just five Senate races received half of all dark money spending -- funds whose sources don\\u2019t have to be disclosed under federal rules -- in the 2014 cycle. The majority of the money supported the GOP candidates -- and all five of those Republicans won.\\n\\n$92.8 million of the $190 million in dark money spent in the cycle went toward Senate races in Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Kentucky and North Carolina\\n\\nAs of mid-October, super PACs spent $29.2 million against Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), and she lost to Thom Tillis (R). More than $18 million went to support Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R), who won in Kentucky. Some $14.1 million was spent against Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.), who lost to Rep. Cory Gardner (R). In Arkansas, $10.4 million was spent against Sen. Mark Pryor (D), who lost to Rep. Tom Cotton (R).\\n\\nIn Alaska, $11.7 million in dark money was spent, with $6.6 million backing the winner, Republican Dan Sullivan, and $5.1 million backing Sen. Mark Begich (D).  Martha Coakley in Massachusetts, Charlie Crist in Florida, Scott Brown in whichever state he\\u2019s currently in \\u2026 all lost once in high-profile statewide races, and then came back this cycle to lose again.\\n\\nBrown has made history with his losses to women, though. After the passage of some state initiatives Tuesday night, recreational marijuana is on track to be legal in at least three states and Washington, D.C.\\n\\nOregon\\u2019s Initiative Petition 53, which passed, would allow adults 21 and over to possess up to 8 ounces of marijuana at home and 1 ounce when in public. Initiative 71 in D.C. also passed and would allow adults to possess up to 2 ounces and grow up to six plants for personal use. Marijuana sales would still be illegal in D.C., however.\\n\\nAlaska voters approved Ballot Measure 2, which would allow adults 21 and over to possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana and grow up to six plants for their own use. Marijuana paraphernalia could also legally be made and sold. \\n\\nColorado and Washington were the first states to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012. Medical marijuana is legal in 23 states and D.C., though an amendment to legalize it in Florida on Tuesday was just shy of the 60 percent approval that was required for passage.\\n\\nPoliticians in other states have already been talking about proposing legalization in the coming years. Voters in Washington state on Tuesday approved a ballot measure to require background checks on all gun sales. It was one of two gun-related initiatives, with a competing proposal that would have prevented the state from imposing additional background check requirements unless first enacted by the federal government. The passage of this ballot measure comes more than 18 months after Congress rejected a federal background check measure proposed in the wake of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, despite polls showing that about 90 percent of Americans supported the policy at the time. With politicians at both the state and national levels having shown little interest in gun control legislation in the period since, this small victory could suggest to proponents that their best chances of success are with voters.\\n\\nThe issue of guns was also on the ballot in Alabama, where voters passed an amendment to declare that every citizen \"has a fundamental right to bear arms and that any restriction on this right would be subject to strict scrutiny.\" At any rate, Alabama is a deep red state, and it seemed unlikely legislators would have moved aggressively on any sort of gun control measure in the first place. Tuesday wasn\\u2019t a good night for the Clintons, whose endorsed candidates largely failed to pull off wins across the country. Shushannah Walshe of ABC News noted their tallies on Twitter:\\n\\n\"How did @hillaryclinton do? She stumped for 26 candidates, 10 wins, 14 losses, @ABC has not projected 1 race, and she backed  Landrieu.\" Walshe tweeted.\\n\\nShe followed it with: \"And how did @billclinton do?

The state was one of the first to legalize medical marijuana in 1996, but so far hasn\\u2019t legalized it for recreational use, like Colorado, Washington, and others. \\u201cI am not opposed to the legalization of marijuana. I\\u2019m the top cop, and so I have to look at it from a law enforcement perspective and a public safety perspective,\\u201d Harris told BuzzFeed News in an interview in Washington, D.C. \\u201cI think we are fortunate to have Colorado and Washington be in front of us on this and figuring out the details of what it looks like when it\\u2019s legalized.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019re watching it happen right before our eyes in Colorado and Washington. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s gonna take too long to figure this out,\\u201d Harris said. \\u201cI think there\\u2019s a certain inevitability about it.\\u201d Harris is one of the few state-level officials appearing at an event on Wednesday at the Center for American Progress, an influential left-wing think tank seen as a feeder institution for the Obama administration. Talked up as a contender to replace Eric Holder as attorney general, Harris, who is one of the Democratic Party\\u2019s likely prospects for higher office in California, said that even with legalization it\\u2019s important that states have systems in place for regulating use of the drug. \\u201cIt would be easier for me to say, \\u2018Let\\u2019s legalize it, let\\u2019s move on,\\u2019 and everybody would be happy. I believe that would be irresponsible of me as the top cop,\\u201d Harris said. \\u201cThe detail of these things matters. For example, what\\u2019s going on right now in Colorado is they\\u2019re figuring out you gotta have a very specific system for the edibles. Maureen Dowd famously did her piece on that\\u2026 There are real issues for law enforcement, [such as] how you will measure someone being under the influence in terms of impairment to drive. \\u201cWe have seen in the history of this issue for California and other states; if we don\\u2019t figure out the details for how it\\u2019s going to be legalized the feds are gonna come in, and I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s in anyone\\u2019s best interest,\\u201d Harris said.  California Gov. Jerry Brown, also a Democrat, has expressed strong misgivings about legalizing marijuana. On NBC\\u2019s Meet the Press in March, Brown asked, \\u201cHow many people can get stoned and still have a great state or a great nation?\\u201d  Harris was far less apprehensive. \\u201cI don\\u2019t have any moral opposition to it or anything like that. Half my family\\u2019s from Jamaica,\\u201d Harris said with a laugh. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!  \\nTagged: kamala harris, californa, marijauana \\n ',\n",
        " u'Cancel Set    Washington states first marijuana auction brought in about $600,000.  Fireweed Farms of Prosser sold about 300 pounds of pot to state-licensed processors and retailers Saturday, the Tri-City Herald reported ( http:is.gdJsJp6T ). Bidding took place under a black tent fronted by tall heaters, and the event was monitored by at least two representatives of the Washington Liquor Control Board. Bidders could smell plastic bags of buds before offering a bid.  The marijuana was planted in May and harvested between late September and mid-October. Fireweed Farms owner Randy Williams had sold some of his marijuana to recreational processors earlier this year, but the auction represented the bulk of his harvest.  He said he held the auction to \"get rid of it all quick\" so he could spend time with his grandson instead of packaging marijuana. The harvested and dried marijuana was priced by the gram and auctioned by the strain in lots ranging from about half a pound to five pounds.  Williams said he planned to donate proceeds from three lots, totaling $14,000, to local schools.  Lt. Jeremy Wissing, an officer with the state Liquor Control Board who monitored a portion of Saturdays auction, said it appeared to be well run.  \"Im seeing a well-organized event,\" Wissing said outside the Fireweed Farms grow area. \"It isnt a circus. Im not seeing open consumption of marijuana.\"  Williams initially hoped to make $1 million through the marijuana fire sale, but said during the auction that hed be happy with $600,000 or $700,000.  The purchased marijuana was to remain under video-monitored quarantine at Fireweed Farms overnight Saturday, Wissing said. Buyers could either retrieve their marijuana Sunday or arrange for it to be delivered to their business by Williams.  Although Saturdays auction was the states first, Wissing doesnt expect it to be the last.  \"Its just a different way of moving his product,\" Wissing said.  Interest in the marijuana auction was so intense that Williams commissioned the use of a parking lot across the street from his property to accommodate the visitors.  Buyers were provided with a detailed list of strains and lot sizes that provided a complete potency profile, labeling requirements and the date the batch was tested by Confidence Analytics, a state-certified laboratory. The auction attracted about three dozen potential buyers from across the state.  Nazareth Victoria, a 50-year-old licensed marijuana processor from Seattle, left empty-handed. He came because he was interested in seeing what was available, but ultimately wasnt sure about the quality, he said.  \"I was just interested in the whole process,\" Victoria said. \"To me, smoking the product is the ultimate test to tell you the quality.\"  Sampling the product was strictly forbidden Saturday.  \"This is a controlled business environment,\" Wissing said.

California Attorney General Kamala Harris says she is \"not opposed\" to legalizing marijuana, but stopped short of endorsing efforts to do so in the Golden State.  With legal recreational marijuana use fully underway in Colorado and Washington -- and similar programs on the horizon in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C. -- advocates are hoping to bring a legalization initiative to the California ballot in 2016. Medical marijuana has been legal in the state since 1996, but recreational use is still prohibited.  In an interview Monday with BuzzFeed, Harris said that while she has no \"moral opposition\" to the substance, she has concerns over the law enforcement implications of legalizing it:  \"I am not opposed to the legalization of marijuana. I\\'m the top cop, and so I have to look at it from a law enforcement perspective and a public safety perspective,\\u201d Harris told BuzzFeed News in an interview in Washington, D.C. \\u201cI think we are fortunate to have Colorado and Washington be in front of us on this and figuring out the details of what it looks like when it\\u2019s legalized.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\'re watching it happen right before our eyes in Colorado and Washington. I don\\'t think it\\u2019s gonna take too long to figure this out,\\u201d Harris said. \\u201cI think there\\'s a certain inevitability about it.\" Read the full BuzzFeed interview here. Earlier this month, Harris was elected to a second term, defeating pro-weed Republican Ron Gold. During the campaign, Harris largely evaded the issue, saying it should be left to voters to decide. (Recent polls have indicated that California voters support legalizing recreational pot.) While California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) remains tepid on legal pot, the issue has found a champion in Lt. Gov Gavin Newsom, who has said he would back a legalization ballot measure in 2016. Harris, however, told BuzzFeed she feels it would be \"irresponsible\" for her to make a similar endorsement.  \\u201cIt would be easier for me to say, \\'Let\\u2019s legalize it, let\\u2019s move on,\\' and everybody would be happy. I believe that would be irresponsible of me as the top cop,\" she said.   Harris, seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party, has already been floated as a potential replacement for California Sen. Barbara Boxer (D), who is rumored to be leaning towards retiring after her term ends in 2016. She was also eyed as a potential replacement for outgoing U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, but said she had no interest in the role. \"I am focused on key public safety issues including transnational gangs, truancy and recidivism,\" Harris said in a statement about the speculation.  Also on HuffPost: Despite the help they got on the campaign trail, candidates with family political legacies did not fare well Tuesday.\\n\\nGeorgia state Sen. Jason Carter (D), the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, lost in his bid for the state\\u2019s governorship. Democrat Michelle Nunn, the daughter of former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), lost in Georgia\\u2019s Senate race.\\n\\nSen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) had assistance from his mother and father, former U.S. Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.), during his re-election campaign. Yet he lost his seat to Rep. Tom Cotton (R). And Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) moved on to a runoff instead of winning re-election outright, despite being the daughter of former New Orleans Mayor Moon Landrieu (D).\\n\\nPerhaps the brightest spot for political offspring on Tuesday was a win for Gwen Graham, the daughter of former U.S. Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.). She defeated incumbent Rep. Steve Southerland in Florida\\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. Even before Election Day, voters in Texas were having trouble casting ballots because of a new state voter ID law that the Supreme Court allowed to stand. And on Election Day the reports of voters being turned away continued.\\n\\nThe Texas law, which Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called an \\u201cunconstitutional poll tax\\u201d in her October dissent to the court\\'s decision, requires voters to provide one of seven types of photo ID in order to vote. Concealed handgun licenses are valid, but college IDs are not. The law\\u2019s strict provisions have led civil rights groups to argue it was designed to hamper turnout from minorities and young people, who tend to vote Democratic.\\n\\nTexas isn\\u2019t the only place new laws were implemented. In all, 14 states are navigating new rules related to voting.  Rep. Steve Southerland (R-Fla.) was the first incumbent House representative to lose on Tuesday night, falling to Democratic challenger Gwen Graham in a race in which the congressman\\'s comments about women became a major point of contention.\\n\\nIn September, Southerland came under fire for a men-only fundraiser his campaign had held earlier in the year. An invitation to the event told invited members to \"tell the misses not to wait up.\" When Graham\\'s campaign made issue of the fundraiser, Southerland replied by likening it to a \"lingerie party.\"\\n\\nThe back and forth led Democrats with Graham\\'s campaign to charge that Southerland was partaking in the so-called \"war on women,\" and the congressman later faced attacks for his vote against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. For Rep. Michael Grimm (R-N.Y.), winning a third term was as easy as taking candy from a baby.\\n\\nVote tallies on election night showed Grimm with more than a 10-point lead over his challenger, Democrat Dominic Recchia, even though the congressman is facing a host of federal tax fraud charges and earlier this year was caught on tape threatening to break a TV reporter \"in half.\"\\n\\nGrimm will face trial in February for 20 counts of mail and tax fraud relating to a restaurant he once owned, the New York Observer reports. Sweeping immigration reform was dealt another blow Tuesday as Republicans took control of the U.S. Senate. With control of both chambers, the GOP could pass an immigration reform bill on its own terms, in hopes it would boost the party\\u2019s standing with Latinos for the 2016 elections. If that were to happen, President Barack Obama would probably feel inclined to sign the bill. However, it\\u2019s unlikely to encompass all the changes reform groups -- and Democrats -- have been pushing for.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Obama has said he plans to pursue reform through executive action after the elections regardless, so Congress\\u2019 unwillingness to address the issue might not prevent it from happening. It\\u2019s hard to prove whether campaign tactics of fear won an election for any candidate, but it\\u2019s clear plenty of campaigns were cultivating fear about Ebola, the Islamic State and immigration, yet didn\\u2019t suffer any major retribution.\\n\\nEven a GOP candidate who used an image from an Islamic State beheading in his campaign ad was polling within 15 percentage points of Sen. Tom Udall shortly before Election Day. Even before Election Day, Maine\\u2019s independent gubernatorial candidate, Eliot Cutler, told supporters to vote their conscience when he was running behind in the polls. The statement served as a signal that he knew he wasn\\u2019t going to win, even though he wasn\\u2019t dropping out of the race.\\n\\nKansas independent Senate candidate Greg Orman, however, was in a tight race with unpopular GOP incumbent Sen. Pat Roberts as voters went to the polls Tuesday. However, he couldn\\u2019t pull out a win. Abortion rights were upheld Tuesday as two \\u201cpersonhood\\u201d amendments on state ballots were rejected. \\n\\nNorth Dakota rejected Measure 1, which would have added a statement to the state constitution that declared, \\u201cThe inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and protected.\\u201d Coloradans rejected Amendment 67 on their ballot. The measure would have included fetuses in the state\\u2019s criminal code where the words \\u201cperson\\u201d or \\u201cchild\\u201d were used. The state\\u2019s voters have turned down personhood measures in the past.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Tennessee\\u2019s Amendment 1, which passed in the red state, declares that the state constitution doesn\\u2019t protect a woman\\u2019s right to an abortion or the funding of abortions. This doesn\\u2019t bode well for Democratic presidential hopefuls: In recent presidential elections with no incumbent, the party that controls Congress has taken the White House.\\n\\nPresident Barack Obama was elected in 2008, while Democrats controlled both chambers. When George W. Bush was elected in 2000, the GOP had the House and Senate. Democrats ran Congress in 1992, when Bill Clinton won the presidency.\\n\\nBut not all hope is lost. GOP Presidents George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon and Dwight Eisenhower all won while Democrats controlled Congress. Measures to raise the minimum wage were on the ballot in five states Tuesday. In four Republican-leaning states -- Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota -- voters considered binding measures to enact hikes, while in Illinois, the referendum was only advisory. \\n\\nVoters in Alaska approved a measure to raise the minimum wage to $9.75 from its current $7.75. In Nebraska, a similar push to hike the hourly wage to $9 from the federal minimum of $7.25 also passed. And in Arkansas and South Dakota, which both currently use the federal minimum wage, voters decided to change the minimum wage to $8.50 an hour. The non-binding referendum in Illinois to raise the minimum wage to $10, from the current statewide $8.25, won as well. \\n\\nFirst and foremost, this is a win for the low-wage workers who will see more take-home pay next year. But there have been ongoing disputes over the potential long-term effects of wage increases, with some economists suggesting that they will lead to lost jobs and make it harder for low-skilled workers to find work. Others have said the overall effects on the job market will be negligible. FiveThirtyEight has a more complete analysis on how these hikes could affect the workforces in various states.\\n\\nPolitically, however, this could be a sign that Obama\\'s campaign to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 is an increasingly popular issue that plays well in elections -- perhaps particularly for Democrats, who have stood behind the president\\'s push. While a number of GOP candidates from the states that voted on minimum wage measures eventually announced support for those initiatives, Republicans in Congress have consistently resisted similar nationwide efforts. Going into the 2014 election cycle, there were exactly zero admitted atheists serving in Congress. That didn\\'t change on Tuesday night, as the most viable candidate, James Woods, a blind Democrat running in a deeply red congressional district in Arizona, failed to pull off an upset against longtime GOP Rep. Matt Salmon.\\n\\nVarious areligious groups have claimed in the past that there are a number of congressional representatives who don\\'t believe in God. At this point, however, they remain unwilling to express such views in public.  Voters on Tuesday told the \\u201ckissing congressman\\u201d not to return to Congress. \\n\\nRep. Vance McAllister (R-La.), who was caught on tape with a married former employee earlier this year, said a couple of weeks after the video surfaced that he wouldn\\u2019t run for re-election. However, two months later, he re-entered the race. \\n\\nIn the end, voters decided to give someone else a shot at his seat. Although the race will go to a runoff, McAllister will not be on the ballot. Just five Senate races received half of all dark money spending -- funds whose sources don\\u2019t have to be disclosed under federal rules -- in the 2014 cycle. The majority of the money supported the GOP candidates -- and all five of those Republicans won.\\n\\n$92.8 million of the $190 million in dark money spent in the cycle went toward Senate races in Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Kentucky and North Carolina\\n\\nAs of mid-October, super PACs spent $29.2 million against Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), and she lost to Thom Tillis (R). More than $18 million went to support Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R), who won in Kentucky. Some $14.1 million was spent against Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.), who lost to Rep. Cory Gardner (R). In Arkansas, $10.4 million was spent against Sen. Mark Pryor (D), who lost to Rep. Tom Cotton (R).\\n\\nIn Alaska, $11.7 million in dark money was spent, with $6.6 million backing the winner, Republican Dan Sullivan, and $5.1 million backing Sen. Mark Begich (D).  Martha Coakley in Massachusetts, Charlie Crist in Florida, Scott Brown in whichever state he\\u2019s currently in \\u2026 all lost once in high-profile statewide races, and then came back this cycle to lose again.\\n\\nBrown has made history with his losses to women, though. After the passage of some state initiatives Tuesday night, recreational marijuana is on track to be legal in at least three states and Washington, D.C.\\n\\nOregon\\u2019s Initiative Petition 53, which passed, would allow adults 21 and over to possess up to 8 ounces of marijuana at home and 1 ounce when in public. Initiative 71 in D.C. also passed and would allow adults to possess up to 2 ounces and grow up to six plants for personal use. Marijuana sales would still be illegal in D.C., however.\\n\\nAlaska voters approved Ballot Measure 2, which would allow adults 21 and over to possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana and grow up to six plants for their own use. Marijuana paraphernalia could also legally be made and sold. \\n\\nColorado and Washington were the first states to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012. Medical marijuana is legal in 23 states and D.C., though an amendment to legalize it in Florida on Tuesday was just shy of the 60 percent approval that was required for passage.\\n\\nPoliticians in other states have already been talking about proposing legalization in the coming years. Voters in Washington state on Tuesday approved a ballot measure to require background checks on all gun sales. It was one of two gun-related initiatives, with a competing proposal that would have prevented the state from imposing additional background check requirements unless first enacted by the federal government. The passage of this ballot measure comes more than 18 months after Congress rejected a federal background check measure proposed in the wake of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, despite polls showing that about 90 percent of Americans supported the policy at the time. With politicians at both the state and national levels having shown little interest in gun control legislation in the period since, this small victory could suggest to proponents that their best chances of success are with voters.\\n\\nThe issue of guns was also on the ballot in Alabama, where voters passed an amendment to declare that every citizen \"has a fundamental right to bear arms and that any restriction on this right would be subject to strict scrutiny.\" At any rate, Alabama is a deep red state, and it seemed unlikely legislators would have moved aggressively on any sort of gun control measure in the first place. Tuesday wasn\\u2019t a good night for the Clintons, whose endorsed candidates largely failed to pull off wins across the country. Shushannah Walshe of ABC News noted their tallies on Twitter:\\n\\n\"How did @hillaryclinton do? She stumped for 26 candidates, 10 wins, 14 losses, @ABC has not projected 1 race, and she backed  Landrieu.\" Walshe tweeted.\\n\\nShe followed it with: \"And how did @billclinton do? Out of 41 candidates,  10 wins, 21 losses, Mary Landrieu will go to a run off & @ABC has not projected 10 races.\"\\n\\nThat said, many are expecting Hillary to focus on becoming a winner between now and 2016. \\nIn an interview with BuzzFeed News, California Attorney General Kamala Harris, a rising star in the Democratic Party, said she had \\u201cno moral opposition\\u201d to marijuana legalization. But there are a lot of details to figure out.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBF_STATIC.timequeue.push(function () { document.getElementById(\"update_posted_time_3515945\").innerHTML = \"posted on  \" + UI.dateFormat.get_formatted_date(1416264488); });\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n View this image \\u203a California Attorney General Kamala Harris, a rising star in the Democratic Party, says she\\u2019s \\u201cnot opposed\\u201d to her state legalizing marijuana.  The state was one of the first to legalize medical marijuana in 1996, but so far hasn\\u2019t legalized it for recreational use, like Colorado, Washington, and others. \\u201cI am not opposed to the legalization of marijuana. I\\u2019m the top cop, and so I have to look at it from a law enforcement perspective and a public safety perspective,\\u201d Harris told BuzzFeed News in an interview in Washington, D.C. \\u201cI think we are fortunate to have Colorado and Washington be in front of us on this and figuring out the details of what it looks like when it\\u2019s legalized.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019re watching it happen right before our eyes in Colorado and Washington. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s gonna take too long to figure this out,\\u201d Harris said. \\u201cI think there\\u2019s a certain inevitability about it.\\u201d Harris is one of the few state-level officials appearing at an event on Wednesday at the Center for American Progress, an influential left-wing think tank seen as a feeder institution for the Obama administration. Talked up as a contender to replace Eric Holder as attorney general, Harris, who is one of the Democratic Party\\u2019s likely prospects for higher office in California, said that even with legalization it\\u2019s important that states have systems in place for regulating use of the drug. \\u201cIt would be easier for me to say, \\u2018Let\\u2019s legalize it, let\\u2019s move on,\\u2019 and everybody would be happy. I believe that would be irresponsible of me as the top cop,\\u201d Harris said. \\u201cThe detail of these things matters. For example, what\\u2019s going on right now in Colorado is they\\u2019re figuring out you gotta have a very specific system for the edibles. Maureen Dowd famously did her piece on that\\u2026 There are real issues for law enforcement, [such as] how you will measure someone being under the influence in terms of impairment to drive. \\u201cWe have seen in the history of this issue for California and other states; if we don\\u2019t figure out the details for how it\\u2019s going to be legalized the feds are gonna come in, and I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s in anyone\\u2019s best interest,\\u201d Harris said.  California Gov. Jerry Brown, also a Democrat, has expressed strong misgivings about legalizing marijuana. On NBC\\u2019s Meet the Press in March, Brown asked, \\u201cHow many people can get stoned and still have a great state or a great nation?\\u201d  Harris was far less apprehensive. \\u201cI don\\u2019t have any moral opposition to it or anything like that. Half my family\\u2019s from Jamaica,\\u201d Harris said with a laugh.

The question is: why hasn\\u2019t California? One might think that California would be the first to legalize recreational marijuana, but no. In what some people are calling the \\u201cmarijuana midterm\\u201d election, Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C. joined Colorado and Washington State in legalizing recreational marijuana \\u2014 that\\u2019s different from medical marijuana which is legal in California and in a number of states. And where is California? After all, we were leading the way on this issue. In 1975, we reduced the penalty for small amounts of marijuana to a misdemeanor, then in 1996 voters made California the first state to legalize medical marijuana and just a few years ago, our elected officials further reduced the penalty for possession of an ounce or less to a civil infraction with no jail time. But the question of whether to make recreational use legal brings up two\\xa0questions: first, should we legalize it? And second, how\\xa0should we legalize it? On the first question, you may be surprised to learn that only a slim majority of likely voters in California wants to legalize marijuana at all. A recent poll by the Public Policy Institute of California shows that only 53 percent of likely voters said we should. And even among people who do want to legalize marijuana, they still need to agree on what it would look like. What does it mean for public safety jobs where employees are drug tested? What it is the legal limit for intoxication? What about the fact that its still illegal under federal law? But now that other states have taken the plunge, it could be less complicated for California. Governor Jerry Brown, who is against legalization, says he\\u2019s looking closely at how Colorado is doing to see if we should do something similar. In fact, the same group that played a major role in Colorado\\u2019s law, called the Marijuana Policy Project, has formed a committee to put a measure on California\\u2019s ballot in 2016. It doesn\\u2019t need to be a ballot measure and\\xa0the legislature could at any point pass the same law. But it\\u2019s still not a slam dunk. Just two years ago, there was an attempt to legalize marijuana here in California and it failed. So, don\\u2019t look for your elected officials to stick their neck out on this issue where we\\u2019re so divided. If it\\u2019s going to happen anytime soon, it\\u2019s going to come from the voters.

This is the next step proponents said must be taken to allow them to utilize a new state law that currently they cannot. Last year, the Iowa legislature approved a limited law allowing possession of cannabis oil for people with severe epilepsy, but when medical marijuana cards are handed out early next year, the cards will not provide protection from prosecution in other states or on a federal level for trying to transport or mail the cannabis oil. We will basically be unable to access any high CBD-oil, low-THC anywhere in the United States. So Im not sure what we will do with the card, Sally Gaer said at the Monday meeting. Gaers daughter has severe epilepsy. Proponents will be lobbying legislators to take the next step to allow production and distribution of medical marijuana in Iowa. A special marijuana review committee heard comments Monday before deciding if they will recommend reclassifying marijuana to the Iowa Board of Pharmacy later this week. A board member with Drug Free Iowa said such a move would send a mixed message to young Iowans. CBD oil and THC oil is very hard to discern, that using an e-cigarette is a very easy way to consume them and that we see an increasing amount of children using marijuana through e-cigarettes, said Peter Komendowski, of Partnership for a Drug Free Iowa. Another group will be lobbying for more diseases and ailments to be included in the law in addition to epilepsy. One woman said she wants to be able to treat her cancer with cannabis oil. I have four kids I have to be here for, with my youngest who just turned 8. I have to be here. I have to do anything in my power to live, Lori Tassin said Monday. The committee will make its recommendation on whether to reclassify marijuana to the Iowa Board of Pharmacy on Wednesday. The board will then either agree, disagree or table for further analysis.

This bottle was produced in Colorado and was being used to treat a girl there. \\n(Photo: \\nAssociated Press/file photo\\n) Patients, medical professionals and drug-abuse prevention specialists testified Monday about whether Iowa should relax its strict ban on medical uses of marijuana. The conflicting opinions were offered to a committee of the Iowa Board of Pharmacy, which is considering renewing its recommendation that the state reclassify marijuana in a way that could make it easier to use legally for medical purposes. \"We\\'re in a bit of a predicament,\" board Chairman Edward Maier told several dozen people who gathered for the Des Moines hearing. Maier noted that Iowa law now classifies marijuana as both a Schedule I drug, whose use is forbidden for almost any purpose, and a Schedule II drug, which could be used under strict regulation and a doctor\\'s prescription. The board recommended in 2009 that legislators reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug, which would be a step toward legalizing its use for some medical purposes. That proposal failed to gain traction. Retired Des Moines physician Edward Hertko, a longtime proponent of legalizing marijuana, said opponents have falsely painted it as addictive and as a gateway to harder drugs. \"Its hazards pale when compared with alcohol and tobacco,\" he told the pharmacy board. In fact, he said, marijuana is less deadly than sugar, which causes thousands of deaths each year from obesity and diabetes. Iowa legislators last year passed a limited bill that would decriminalize possession of a marijuana extract for people with severe epilepsy. However, families who lobbied for the new law say it\\'s unworkable, because it doesn\\'t allow for the production or sale of the drug in Iowa, and most other states don\\'t allow sales to non-residents. University of Iowa pharmacy professor Ron Herman said scientific studies that compare marijuana\\'s effects to those of placebos have found relatively small effects on such things as pain. Herman also warned that unlike patients using pharmaceuticals, people using most marijuana products don\\'t know how strong each dose is. DESMOINESREGISTER Medical marijuana gets fresh look from pharmacy board \"If I had a child with intractable epilepsy, and I wanted to give cannabidiol oil to treat those seizures, I would want to make sure that every dose that child is getting is the same every time.\" Herman said some people have suggested the University of Iowa could help ensure such standardization, but he said the university lacks such capability. Kate Gainer, executive vice president of the Iowa Pharmacy Association, said any program to allow medical uses of marijuana must include doctors, pharmacists and other medical professionals. \"If a medical marijuana program is truly to be for medical purposes, it should be part of our current medical system, and not a secondary drug distribution system,\" such as those being formed in some other states. Dale Woolery, associate director of the Governor\\'s Office of Drug Control Policy, warned that marijuana has been implicated in increasing numbers of traffic accidents and hospital visits. The current versions are increasingly potent, he said. \"It\\'s not the marijuana of 20 or 30 years ago.\" But cancer patient Lori Tassin of Des Moines said she believes the drug can shrink tumors and provide other benefits. \"It should be my choice,\" she told the board. \"It should be between my doctor and me.\" The full pharmacy board is to discuss the issue Wednesday. Maier, who is a Mapleton pharmacist, warned that the board does not have authority to legalize medical marijuana on its own. However, he said, the board will consider advising legislators on the issue. ',\n",

Both classifications, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, suggest the drug has a high potential for abuse. The difference: Class II drugs have accepted medical uses. That is why medical marijuana advocates seek the change. Eventually, were going to run out of options, and I want (medical marijuana) to be an option for me, said Lori Tassin of Des Moines, who said she has been diagnosed with lung cancer and brain tumors. Tassin was among the 13 speakers who addressed a subcommittee of the Iowa Pharmacy Board on Monday. The full board will decide Wednesday whether to restate its suggestion to the Legislature next year. The Pharmacy Board in 2010 unanimously agreed to recommend to the Iowa Legislature that it change marijuana from a Class I to Class II drug. The Legislature did not act on the suggestion. A petition filed earlier this year requested the Pharmacy Board officially restate its recommendation to the Legislature, which in 2014 passed a law allowing use of cannabidiol, an oil found in the marijuana plant for prescribed medical treatment of children with epilepsy. But parents whose children could benefit from the law say it is too narrowly drawn and makes it difficult for them to obtain the cannabidiol, which is not produced in Iowa and is illegal to possess in other states. I urge that the Iowa Board of Pharmacy recommend to the Iowa Legislature and the governor to remove medical marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II, allowing this plant to be recommended by physicians and studied by the medical communities, said Sally Gaer of West Des Moines, whose 24-year-old daughter has epilepsy. Two representatives of Gov. Terry Branstads administration spoke Monday in opposition to changing marijuanas classification: Dale Woolery, with the governors Office of Drug Control Policy, and Peter Komendowski, with that offices Partnership for a Drug Free Iowa. The public discussion that continues in our nation today over marijuana, indeed, is unsettled to say the least. Mixed in with those sincerely talking about potential medical benefits are others who seemingly are more motivated by money, personal choice, addictions or other reasons, Woolery said.

This bottle was produced in Colorado and was being used to treat a girl there. \\n(Photo: \\nAssociated Press/file photo\\n) Patients, medical professionals and drug-abuse prevention specialists testified Monday about whether Iowa should relax its strict ban on medical uses of marijuana. The conflicting opinions were offered to a committee of the Iowa Board of Pharmacy, which is considering renewing its recommendation that the state reclassify marijuana in a way that could make it easier to use legally for medical purposes. \"We\\'re in a bit of a predicament,\" board Chairman Edward Maier told several dozen people who gathered for the Des Moines hearing. Maier noted that Iowa law now classifies marijuana as both a Schedule I drug, whose use is forbidden for almost any purpose, and a Schedule II drug, which could be used under strict regulation and a doctor\\'s prescription. The board recommended in 2009 that legislators reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug, which would be a step toward legalizing its use for some medical purposes. That proposal failed to gain traction. Retired Des Moines physician Edward Hertko, a longtime proponent of legalizing marijuana, said opponents have falsely painted it as addictive and as a gateway to harder drugs. \"Its hazards pale when compared with alcohol and tobacco,\" he told the pharmacy board. In fact, he said, marijuana is less deadly than sugar, which causes thousands of deaths each year from obesity and diabetes. Iowa legislators last year passed a limited bill that would decriminalize possession of a marijuana extract for people with severe epilepsy. However, families who lobbied for the new law say it\\'s unworkable, because it doesn\\'t allow for the production or sale of the drug in Iowa, and most other states don\\'t allow sales to non-residents. University of Iowa pharmacy professor Ron Herman said scientific studies that compare marijuana\\'s effects to those of placebos have found relatively small effects on such things as pain. Herman also warned that unlike patients using pharmaceuticals, people using most marijuana products don\\'t know how strong each dose is. DESMOINESREGISTER Medical marijuana gets fresh look from pharmacy board \"If I had a child with intractable epilepsy, and I wanted to give cannabidiol oil to treat those seizures, I would want to make sure that every dose that child is getting is the same every time.\" Herman said some people have suggested the University of Iowa could help ensure such standardization, but he said the university lacks such capability. Kate Gainer, executive vice president of the Iowa Pharmacy Association, said any program to allow medical uses of marijuana must include doctors, pharmacists and other medical professionals. \"If a medical marijuana program is truly to be for medical purposes, it should be part of our current medical system, and not a secondary drug distribution system,\" such as those being formed in some other states. Dale Woolery, associate director of the Governor\\'s Office of Drug Control Policy, warned that marijuana has been implicated in increasing numbers of traffic accidents and hospital visits. The current versions are increasingly potent, he said. \"It\\'s not the marijuana of 20 or 30 years ago.\" But cancer patient Lori Tassin of Des Moines said she believes the drug can shrink tumors and provide other benefits. \"It should be my choice,\" she told the board. \"It should be between my doctor and me.\" The full pharmacy board is to discuss the issue Wednesday. Maier, who is a Mapleton pharmacist, warned that the board does not have authority to legalize medical marijuana on its own. However, he said, the board will consider advising legislators on the issue. ']"

To help ensure a big roll-out, Marley Natural products will be packaged and marketed with input from the same P.R. agency that played a key role in branding Starbucks Coffee and New Balance running shoes. A Marley Natural slogan, \"Make way for the positive day,\" has already been introduced.</p><p class=\"permalinkable\" id=\"h1887458-p3\">At least one of Bob Marley's quotes \u2013 \"When you smoke the herb it reveals you to yourself\" \u2013 is also being used in the marketing campaign for Marley Natural. Members of the deceased reggae singer-songwriter's family announced Marley Natural on Tuesday morning's edition of the TV show NBC Today.</p><div class=\"inline inline_embedded inline-right \" style=\"width:100%;\"><h4 class=\"title\">Introducing Marley Natural Fine Cannabis</h4><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Xv9aieNT6x0\" width=\"560\"></iframe><p class=\"caption\"></p></div><p class=\"permalinkable\" id=\"h1887458-p4\">An accompanying video, narrated by an unidentified woman and featuring Marley's classic songs \"One Love\" and \"Could You Be Loved,\" proclaims that Marley Natural is \"inspired by a deep respect for nature, for its power to awaken our well-being, we embark on a new chapter of his legacy to realize more fully the benefits of cannabis for the mind, body and spirit. Make way for the positive day.\" </p><p class=\"permalinkable\" id=\"h1887458-p5\">The video makes no mention of Bob Marley having been, as many Jamaicans and reggae artists are to this day, a devout Rastarfarian. The monotheistic Rastafari religious movement regards marijuana as a \u201csacrament\u201d and contends its use is, in fact, sanctioned by the Bible.</p><p class=\"permalinkable\" id=\"h1887458-p6\">How so? Rastafarians point to a line in Psalms 104:14: \u201cHe causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man.\u201d The video also omits any mention of the fact Marley reportedly smoked nearly a pound of pot per week. </p><p class=\"permalinkable\" id=\"h1887458-p7\">Marley Natural is the brainchild of the Seattle-based private equity company Privateer Holdings, which exclusively focuses on marijuana industry products and investments. Marley Natural will also sell an array of other pot-related products, including marijuana creams, lotions and various accessories, such as e-cigarette-styled vaporizers, inspired by both Marley and marijuana.</p><p class=\"permalinkable\" id=\"h1887458-p8\">In a taped video statement provided to NBC News, Cedella Marley, 47, Bob's first-born daughter, said: \"It just seems natural that Daddy should be part of this conversation. As Daddy would say: 'Make way for the positive day'.\"</p><p class=\"permalinkable\" id=\"h1887458-p9\">The video also includes Rohan Marley, 42, one of Bob and Rita Marley's sons. \"Herb is for the healing of the nation,\" he said. \"Herb is for the meditation; herb is for the higher vibrations.\"</p><p class=\"permalinkable\" id=\"h1887458-p10\">Cedella and Rohan's mother, Rita Marley, agrees, saying: \u201cMy husband believed \u2018the herb\u2019 was a natural and positive part of life, and he felt it was important to the world. He looked forward to this day.\u201d</p><p class=\"permalinkable\" id=\"h1887458-p11\">Apparently, Marley also looked forward to more widespread marijuana cultivation and sales.</p><div class=\"article-pagination clearfix\"><div class=\"subject\">Page:</div><ul class=\"list-inline clearfix\"><li><a class=\"current\" href=\"/news/2014/nov/18/bob-marley-marijuana-brand-to-be-marketed/?#article-copy\" rel=\"prev\">1</a></li><li><a class=\"\" href=\"/news/2014/nov/18/bob-marley-marijuana-brand-to-be-marketed/2/?#article-copy\" rel=\"prev\">2</a></li><li><a href=\"/news/2014/nov/18/bob-marley-marijuana-brand-to-be-marketed/2/?#article-copy\" rel=\"next\"><div class=\"ss-icon\">\u27a1</div></a></li></ul></div></div><footer class=\"clearfix\"><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"UTSanDiego\" data-src=\"http://www.U-T San Diego/news/2014/nov/18/bob-marley-marijuana-brand-to-be-marketed/\" data-widget-id=\"AR_1\"></div><div class=\"OUTBRAIN\" data-ob-template=\"UTSanDiego\" data-src=\"http://www.U-T San Diego/news/2014/nov/18/bob-marley-marijuana-brand-to-be-marketed/\" data-widget-id=\"AR_2\"></div><script async=\"async\" src=\"http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\u00a0\n",

He\u00a0viewed it as a spiritual and creative force that was probably more likely to be legalized by <a href=\"http://www.hightimes.com/read/high-times-interview-bob-marley\" target=\"_blank\"> \u201cChrist\u2019s government\u201d</a> than governments\u00a0here on Earth.</p> <p>But times have changed\u00a0\u2013 in a big way. Look no further than Tuesday\u2019s announcement by Marley\u2019s family that it plans to\u00a0piggyback on successful efforts to\u00a0legalize marijuana in the United States and elsewhere\u00a0by introducing\u00a0a new brand of marijuana products bearing the late singer\u2019s name.</p> <p>\u201cMarley Natural\u201d is being launched by\u00a0Privateer Holdings, a cannabis industry investment firm, and products will reach the market in\u00a0late 2015.</p> <p>\u201cMy dad would be so happy to see people understanding the healing power of the herb,\u201d Marley\u2019s daughter\u00a0Cedella Marley\u00a0said in a news release.\u00a0\u201cHe viewed the herb as something spiritual that could awaken our well-being, deepen our reflection, connect us to nature and liberate our creativity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMarley Natural is an authentic way to honor his legacy by adding his voice to the conversation about cannabis and helping end the social harms caused by prohibition,\u201d she added. It will offer\u00a0organically grown heirloom Jamaican marijuana strains, in keeping with Marley\u2019s preference for high-quality marijuana grown without the use of fertilizer. And it will be available in jurisdictions that allow recreational or medicinal marijuana sales. The brand also plans to offer cannabis- and hemp-infused products such as lotions and sun-repair creams.</p> <p>Marley\u00a0reportedly smoked as much as a pound of marijuana per week. But at the time of his intense fame in the United States and around the world, he was viewed as a nonconformist symbol.</p> <p>Marley has become even more of a global icon and brand in the years since\u00a0his death, but that it\u2019s now happening\u00a0in a world in which marijuana is decriminalized in some places is something even he didn\u2019t foresee.</p> <p>\u201cLegalize herb? Boy, I jus\u2019 don\u2019 know. It\u2019s kinda legalized already,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.hightimes.com/read/high-times-interview-bob-marley\u00a0\" target=\"_blank\">noted in a 1976 interview with High Times</a>.</p> <p>He was referring to the widespread use and cultivation of marijuana in Jamaica, where the drug has actually been illegal for over 100 years.</p> <p>And change is coming there, too.</p> <p>In late September, the Jamaican government announced that it is considering support for a proposal to decriminalize\u00a0possession of small amounts of what Marley and Rastafarians called the \u201choly herb\u201d if it is being used for\u00a0medicinal, and eventually, religious purposes.</p> <p>That is a direct result of the loosening of\u00a0legalization laws in some U.S. states\u2013 though marijuana remains an illegal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/jamaica-moves-decriminalise-marijuana-possession\" target=\"_blank\">schedule I substance under Federal law.\u00a0</a></p> <p>Over the years, critics of harsh marijuana laws <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/30/world/panel-urges-legalization-of-marijuana-in-jamaica.html\" target=\"_blank\">have\u00a0argued\u00a0that the\u00a0penalties have done little to</a>\u00a0stamp out <a href=\"http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/LATESTNEWS/JAMAICA-LARGEST-CARIBBEAN-SUPPLIER-OF-MARIJUANA-TO-THE-US--REPORT-SAYS\" target=\"_blank\">organized crime associated with the\u00a0trafficking</a> of black market drugs, including marijuana, through the island.</p> <p>And of course, there is potentially huge financial upside, as the investment firm Privateer Holdings has sought to demonstrate with its recent business ventures\u00a0in the marijuana space.</p> <p>\u201cThe time has come to provide an opportunity for Jamaicans to benefit from the marijuana industry,\u201d said Kingston\u2019s mayor Angela Brown Burke recently, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-27827678\" target=\"_blank\">according to the Associated Press.\u00a0</a></p> <p>According to a release, the brand will have an unspecified philanthropic component to \u201censure that families and communities who have been harmed by prohibition have the opportunity to benefit from the new, legal cannabis economy,\u201d the company\u2019s announcement said.</p> <p>\u201cMy husband believed \u2018the herb\u2019 was a natural and positive part of life and he felt it was important to the world,\u201d Marley\u2019s wife Rita said in a statement. \u201cHe looked forward to this day.\u201d</p></article>]\n",

We're going to help him finish it.\" </span></p><p><span>It's not the first product that will bear the Marley name. The family has licensed brands of coffee, audio equipment and other goods, including \"king-sized\" rolling papers and shirts that say \"Smoke Like a Marley\"</span></p><p><span>But this is the family's first move into marijuana. </span></p><p><span>\"It just seems natural that Daddy should be part of this conversation,\" said Cedella Marley, 47, Bob's first-born daughter, in a taped statement provided to NBC News. \"As Daddy would say, 'make way for the positive day.'\" </span></p><p><span>\"Herb is for the healing of the nation; herb is for the meditation; herb is for the higher vibrations,\" added Rohan Marley, 42, son of Bob and Rita Marley, who also appears in the video. </span></p><p><span>Marley's wife Rita said Bob, who is said to have smoked about a pound of pot a week, would have been happy to see this happen. \"He's happy because this is what we dreamed of,\" she said, referring to a legal regulated market for marijuana. </span>\"It was unruly for them to call it weed or drugs,\" she continued. \"We saw it as a spiritual thing, given to us by God.\"</p><p>Look for Marley Natural in late 2015.</p><p><figure></figure></p><div class=\"story-asset inline-share-tools-asset\" id=\"module-position-NqyW6zMKooc\"><div class=\"inline-share-tools asset-inline-share-tools asset-inline-share-tools-bottom\"><span class=\"inline-share-btn inline-share-btn-facebook\" data-share-method=\"facebook\" data-uotrack=\"InlineShareFacebookBtn\"><span class=\"inline-share-count inline-share-count-facebook\">\n",

These guys were WAY out ahead of things when they publicly supported marijuana reform in 2012. Below is a reaction that the company put out after marijuana was legalized in Oregon on Election Day 2014:</p><h2>Measure 91 gives a welcome nod to rationality</h2><p>Looking back, many of our Feature articles seem to lean a little toward the depressing side.\u00a0 We\u2019ve written about police abuse, endless war, corporatocracy, political malfeasance, corruption, and so much more, and these are all obviously important issues.\u00a0 We could find a lot more to grumble over in the recent mid-term election results, but instead, we\u2019re going to choose to be happy for a change.\u00a0 Oregon just gave that chance to all of us with the passage of Measure 91, legalizing marijuana for adult recreational use.\u00a0 It\u2019s the long overdue end of a massively destructive policy, and it gives a glimmer of hope that government can (occasionally) give a nod to rationality\u2026</p><p><strong>How did marijuana become illegal?</strong></p><p>The history of marijuana use and prohibition is a symphony of power, ignorance, and corruption, and we aren\u2019t going to attempt to give you a detailed recap here.\u00a0 (If you are interested, though, there are good histories and timelines <a href=\"http://norml.org/component/zoo/category/norml-report-on-sixty-years-of-marijuana-prohibition-in-the-us\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/dope/etc/cron.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_history_of_cannabis_in_the_United_States\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.drugwarfacts.org/cms/Marijuana#Crime\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, and<a href=\"http://www.drugwarrant.com/articles/why-is-marijuana-illegal/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>)\u00a0 <a href=\"http://norml.org/aboutmarijuana/marijuana-a-primer\">Known uses go back before 7000 BC</a>, and marijuana (or hemp) has been used for food, incense, medicine, fabric, rope, paper, cosmetics, fuel, and more.\u00a0 The first laws concerning marijuana didn\u2019t prohibit it; in fact they <em><a href=\"http://www.globalhemp.com/2001/01/hemp-history.html\" target=\"_blank\">required farmers to grow hemp</a></em>!\u00a0 Marijuana was effectively made illegal in 1937 with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marihuana_Tax_Act_of_1937\" target=\"_blank\">Marijuana Tax Act</a>, and when the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leary_v._United_States\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Act was found unconstitutional in 1969</a>, Congress rolled it into 1970\u2019s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act\" target=\"_blank\">Controlled Substances Act</a>.\u00a0 On a Federal level pot remains an illegal <a href=\"http://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Schedule 1 drug</a> (classed with heroin and LSD), but on a state level laws range from states like Oklahoma where you can be get a <a href=\"http://blog.norml.org/2011/05/16/alternet-the-five-worst-states-to-get-busted-with-pot/\" target=\"_blank\">life sentence for selling a $10 bag</a> to the <a href=\"http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000881\" target=\"_blank\">23 states (and DC)</a> that have legalized medical marijuana and the four states that have now legalized it for recreational use. \u00a0(Pot has been decriminalized in Oregon since 1973, the first state to do so.)</p><p>While no substance is completely safe, marijuana is one of the safest around.\u00a0 There is no lethal overdose, it is not physically addictive, and it even has mildly beneficial qualities.\u00a0 Smoking (or eating) marijuana makes you feel relaxed and maybe a little giggly.\u00a0 When pot was first made illegal it wasn\u2019t because of people actually being hurt or going on drug-fueled killing sprees, it was because of an organized propaganda campaign. \u00a0<a href=\"http://www.drugwarrant.com/articles/why-is-marijuana-illegal/\" target=\"_blank\">Support for criminalization</a> came from people who were unfamiliar with and scared of marijuana\u2019s effects, from people who were overtly racist against the groups using it, and from industrial interests who would prosper if hemp were made illegal.\u00a0 As an example, one notable booster was the Dupont Chemical Company, whose recent patent for nylon directly competed with hemp products. \u00a0In the south and west, marijuana was linked with an influx of Mexican immigrants.\u00a0 In the north and east it was linked with jazz music and black people.\u00a0 This <a href=\"http://www.drugwarrant.com/articles/why-is-marijuana-illegal/\" target=\"_blank\">quote from Harry J. Anslinger</a>, one of the driving forces behind marijuana prohibition, sums up the slurs against all the \u201cpot fiends\u201d at the time\u2026</p><p><em>\u201cThere are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the US, and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos, and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz, and swing, result from marijuana use. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers, and any others.\u201d</em></p><p><strong>What has been the effect of criminalization?</strong></p><p>Regardless of why marijuana was initially made illegal, we\u2019ve lived with the effects ever since.\u00a0 While prohibition laws <a href=\"http://www.ukcia.org/research/young/adolescent.php\" target=\"_blank\">did not reduce use</a>, they did increase the costs to our society.\u00a0 With pot laws falling around the country, it\u2019s easy to forget that there are still people serving <a href=\"http://lifeforpot.org/home.html#.VF1zGPnF_SY\" target=\"_blank\">life sentences for possession of marijuana</a>.\u00a0 We could detail the <a href=\"http://tomdwyer.com/2014/newsletters/news-make-furious-civil-asset-forfeiture/\" target=\"_blank\">corrupt cops</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.gvnews.com/news/state/marijuana-legalization-prisons-aren-t-overflowing-but-courts-are-clogged/article_70cdc3f6-1814-11e3-8f4b-001a4bcf887a.html\" target=\"_blank\">clogged courts</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/speak-easy/51809-marijuana-prohibition-costs-pa-too-much-in-ruined-lives-and-unnecessary-expense\" target=\"_blank\">destroyed lives</a>, but the the ACLU has done an excellent job for us.\u00a0 In their project on <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/criminal-law-reform/marijuana-law-reform\" target=\"_blank\">Marijuana Law Reform</a>, they have an excellent series of slides called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/criminal-law-reform/marijuana-arrests-numbers\" target=\"_blank\">Marijuana Arrests By The Numbers</a>\u201d detailing just how destructive these laws have become.\u00a0 We highly encourage you to visit their site, but graphics from their excellent slideshow on the subject are below.\u00a0 For more detail, they also have information on<a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/criminal-law-reform/marijuana-law-reform\" target=\"_blank\">marijuana reform around the country</a>.</p><p>There are several other sources we\u2019d like to direct you\u00a0to for in-depth information about marijuana prohibition, its history, its effects, and its future.\u00a0 The first is <a href=\"http://norml.org/\" target=\"_blank\">NORML, The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws</a>.\u00a0 Since their founding in 1970, NORML has been the premiere advocate for rational pot policies. \u00a0The link below will take you to their <a href=\"http://norml.org/component/zoo/category/norml-report-on-sixty-years-of-marijuana-prohibition-in-the-us\" target=\"_blank\">report on the 60-year prohibition on pot</a>.</p><p>As an advocacy group, NORML may well be a little biased.\u00a0 A more journalistic briefing, yet still fair and in-depth, comes from <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/\" target=\"_blank\">FRONTLINE</a> and their episode \u201c<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/dope/\" target=\"_blank\">Busted-\u00a0 America\u2019s War On Marijuana</a>\u201c.</p><p>There are several common misconceptions about marijuana, and the <a href=\"http://www.drugpolicy.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Drug Policy Alliance</a>has put together a <a href=\"http://www.drugpolicy.org/drug-facts/10-facts-about-marijuana\" target=\"_blank\">page addressing 10 of the most common ones</a>. \u00a0Questions include \u201cDoes marijuana use have long term cognitive effects?\u201d, \u201cIs marijuana a gateway drug?\u201d, and \u201cDoes marijuana impair driving the way alcohol does?\u201d</p><p><strong>What will be the effects of the new law in Oregon?</strong></p><p>The new law has already had some effects as Portland prosecutors begin reviewing their marijuana possession cases.\u00a0 This <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/marijuana/index.ssf/2014/11/legal_marijuana_in_oregon_what.html\" target=\"_blank\">Oregonian article</a> goes into much greater detail.\u00a0\u00a0 The<a href=\"http://www.mpp.org/\">Marijuana Policy Project</a> has a <a href=\"http://www.mpp.org/states/oregon/measure-91-summary.html\" target=\"_blank\">point-by-point analysis of the Measure 91</a>, but here are some of the high points\u2026</p><ul><li>Removes penalties for adults 21 and older who possess, use, and grow a limited amount of marijuana.</li><li>Possession is limited to 8 oz of pot and growing 4 pot plants <em>total for the household</em>. Other limits apply to public possession and gifting.</li><li>The law creates four types of marijuana businesses-\u00a0 Producers, Processors, Wholesalers, and Retailers.</li><li>Possession and home cultivation become legal on July 1, 2015. The OLCC will begin accepting applications for marijuana businesses on January 4, 2016.</li><li>The OLCC will oversee the marijuana industry</li><li>Marijuana flowers will be taxed at $35/oz,, leaves at $10/oz., and plants at $5 each, all adjusted for inflation.</li><li>Taxes go to the Common School Fund, Mental Health Alcoholism and Drug Services, the State Police, and to cities and counties for local law enforcement.</li></ul><p><strong>What\u2019s the future of marijuana legalization?</strong></p><p>People around the country are grappling with balancing the harms from drugs with the harms from legalizing them.\u00a0 As the harms becomes clearer, the <a href=\"http://www.commondreams.org/news/2014/11/05/trend-towards-ending-marijuana-prohibition-continues-legalization-wins-big\" target=\"_blank\">traditional balance is changing</a> and it\u2019s <a href=\"http://mic.com/articles/103674/8-facts-about-marijuana-legalization-everyone-should-know\" target=\"_blank\">beginning to tilt toward legalization</a>.\u00a0 According to <a href=\"http://wallstcheatsheet.com/politics/5-states-and-one-city-ready-to-legalize-marijuana.html/?a=viewall\" target=\"_blank\">Politics Cheat Sheet</a>, we are \u201con the precipice of more states preparing for coming marijuana legalization initiatives, either derived from state legislators or from citizens themselves through the ballots\u201d.\u00a0 They say Massachusetts, California, Missouri, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, and Arizona may go green as soon as 2016.</p><p>Of course, rational drug policy (or any rational policy) isn\u2019t as simple as legalize or don\u2019t.\u00a0 Frontline, as part of its marijuana coverage, featured a judge-led \u201c<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/dope/rational/\">attempt at a rational discussion of the so-called \u2018war on drugs\u2019</a>\u201c.</p><p>\u201cA group of experts with varying political perspectives (law enforcement, treatment practitioners, elected officials, policy analysts, laboratory and clinical researchers) recently proposed \u2018a third way\u2019 to end the drug problem and avoid the current polarization.

        "<p>Marijuana-infused foods and drinks have been a booming sector in Colorado's new recreational marijuana market. But lawmakers feared the products are too easy to confuse with regular foods and drinks and ordered marijuana regulators to require a new look for marijuana edibles.</p><p>The new Health Department suggestion calls for a commission to decide which types of foods can be sold.</p><p>\"The department remains concerned that there are products on the market that so closely resemble children's candy that it can entice children to experiment with marijuana. Marijuana should not seem 'fun' for kids,\" the agency wrote in its recommendation.</p><p>The ultimate decision on how to change Colorado's edibles market will be made by state lawmakers in 2015.</p><p>The state's Marijuana Enforcement Division is holding workgroups with industry representatives, law enforcement, health officials and parent groups to come up with a group recommendation to lawmakers on the question. The final workgroup meets Monday.</p><p>A Health Department spokesman did not respond to a request to comment on the revised suggestion, which hasn't yet been made public.</p><p>Edible-pot makers fumed at the suggestion, saying it runs afoul of a voter-approved constitutional amendment that guarantees access to retail marijuana in all its forms. State regulations limit potency, serving size and packaging, but there are no regulations on what kinds of foods may contain pot. Edible-pot manufacturers say that limitation would go too far.</p><p>\"We're governed to death, and people need to take responsibility for themselves,\" said Elyse Gordon, owner of Better Baked, a Denver company that makes edible pot products including teas, energy bars and candies.</p><p>\"I don't think anyone in the industry is looking to make products for children, and we resent this idea that people aren't responsible for the products they bring into their home.\"</p><p>Also coming out from the Health Department Monday is a highly anticipated statement about marijuana use by pregnant women and nursing mothers.</p><p>The agency was tasked by the Legislature to review the health effects of maternal pot use.</p><p>The preliminary survey to be released Monday says the Health Department found \"limited,\" ''mixed\" or \"moderate\" evidence for links between maternal use of marijuana during pregnancy and health risks like low birth weight and decreased cognitive function.</p><p>The agency stopped short of suggesting warning labels on pot about use by pregnant and nursing women, but the Health Department did lay out some \"Public Health Statements\" about maternal pot use.</p><p>Statements include the fact that marijuana's psychoactive ingredient, THC, can be passed to unborn and nursing babies and that maternal pot use \"is associated with negative effects on exposed children that may not appear until adolescence.\"</p><p>The agency requests a public-education campaign for moms and better data collection on maternal marijuana use.</p><p>___</p><p>Kristen Wyatt can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/APkristenwyatt</p>\n",

One widely-reported <a href=\"http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1691416\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> found that the number of\u00a0kids under 12 who were admitted to the E.R. for accidental pot ingestion in Colorado jumped from zero to 14 after the state liberalized medical marijuana laws in October 2009. More recently, the Denver Post reported on a \"<a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_25807342/childrens-hospital-sees-surge-kids-accidentally-eating-marijuana\" target=\"_blank\">surge in kids</a>\" accidentally eating pot from 2013 to 2014.</p> <p>Stories like these are a big part of the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/16/colorado-marijuana-edibles_n_6167954.html\" target=\"_blank\">push for tougher packaging requirements</a> on Colorado's edibles, the Associated Press's Kristen Wyatt reported this weekend. The Colorado Health Department is planning to recommend\u00a0that new edible projects are subject to \"pre-market approval\" by a new commission.\u00a0Previously, the department had <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_26765732/proposed-colorado-marijuana-edibles-ban-shows-lingering-pot\" target=\"_blank\">recommended</a> a total ban on the sale of edible products, only to hastily withdraw the proposal\u00a0shortly after it was made public.</p> <p>According to the AP, the department wrote that it \"remains concerned that there are products on the market that so closely resemble children's candy that it can entice children to experiment with marijuana.\" These concerns are\u00a0understandable, but they're blown far out of proportion to the actual numbers.</p> <p>Marijuana baked goods have been around for nearly as long as marijuana. And\u00a0marijuana candy has been around for <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobsullum/2014/10/27/the-man-who-accidentally-gave-kids-marijuana-on-halloween/\" target=\"_blank\">well over a decade</a>, at least. And regardless of the delivery method - whether via edibles or smokes - cases of children being unintentionally exposed to marijuana are vanishingly rare.</p> <p>Let's zoom out to the national picture\u00a0to take a look. The American Association of Poison Control Centers maintains the <a href=\"http://www.aapcc.org/data-system/\" target=\"_blank\">National Poison Data System</a>, a near-realtime database of literally every call made to a poison control center in the U.S. Their most recent annual report, reflecting data from 2012, allows us to see the number of reported poisoning cases for marijuana, and to compare this to other\u00a0common drugs and household substances, including over the counter painkillers, diaper creams, and contact lens fluid. I've charted a handful of these below.</p> <div class=\"inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-normal\"> <a name=\"7a4822666c\"></a> <img class=\"unprocessed\" data-hi-res-src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2014/11/marijuana-poisoning.png&amp;w=1484\" data-low-res-src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2014/11/marijuana-poisoning.png&amp;w=480\" src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2014/11/marijuana-poisoning.png&amp;w=480\"/><br/> </div><p></p> <p>What you can see is that for kids 12-and-under, cases of marijuana poisoning are incredibly rare. There were 254 such calls in 2012. By contrast, there were about 1,000 calls related to kids ingesting energy drinks, 1,600 for kids drinking contact lens fluid, and over 4,000 for children who ate birth control pills.</p> <p>Calls for caterpillar stings were twice as common as calls for marijuana exposure, and ingestions of liquid fabric softener were nearly three times as common.</p> <p>Thirty-five thousand\u00a0concerned parents called poison control when their offspring ate diaper creams, nearly 40,000 calls were for ingestion of acetaminophen, and 50,000\u00a0were related solely to\u00a0kids eating too much ibuprofen. Across all substances, the vast majority of cases were for kids 5 and under.</p> <p>These numbers don't tell us about the <i>disposition</i> of these calls - that is, whether parents were told to bring their kids to the hospital, or to just take it easy and put the diaper cream on a higher shelf in the future. They also shouldn't be construed to\u00a0mean that pot is safer for your kids than say, ibuprofen or diaper cream. As a parent of one-year-old twins, I would be much more worried if my kids ate a pot cookie than if they snuck a dab of toothpaste when nobody was looking.</p> <p>The\u00a0numbers are\u00a0partly a function of the fact that ibuprofen and diaper cream are much more common than marijuana in households with small kids. But they suggest that parents who do smoke weed are, generally, doing a pretty good job of keeping it out of kids' reach.</p> <p>Even drilling down to the Colorado numbers, let's recall that <a href=\"http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1691416\" target=\"_blank\">the most widely-cited study</a>\u00a0unearthed a grand total of\u00a014 kids going to the E.R. for accidental marijuana ingestion between October\u00a02009 and December 2011. That represents about 2.4 percent\u00a0all ingestion-related E.R. visits for that age group over that period. While nobody wants to see a\u00a0kid go to the hospital, every single one of the\u00a014 was sent home, and \"none of these exposures resulted in permanent morbidity or mortality,\" according to the study.</p> <p>These numbers are almost certain to inch up as Colorado's marijuana market matures. Frankly they have nowhere to go but up, as they are almost literally at rock-bottom now. Legalization opponents will continue to use them as fodder for their arguments, and as evidence of the need for tougher regulations. But it's important to keep them in perspective: nationwide, kids are 136 times more likely to be poisoned by their diaper cream than by pot, yet nobody is calling for stricter\u00a0labeling requirements on Desitin.</p></article>]\n",

        "<p>\"The unintended consequences of marking things could make them more attractive and not less attractive to adolescents,\" Bajaj said.</p>\n",
        "<p>But the author of the edible-pot law, Rep. Jonathan Singer, insisted that marijuana edibles should have an unmistakable look.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"I want to know the difference between a marijuana cookie and a Chips Ahoy just by looking at it,\" said Singer, D-Longmont.</p>\n",
        "<p>The ultimate decision will be made by next year's state Legislature. The law says recreational edible marijuana on store shelves must have a distinct look by 2016.</p>\n",
        "<p>Also Wednesday, the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center released a one-page summary on cases of accidental pot ingestions.</p>\n",
        "<p>The agency reported that calls about children ingesting marijuana have gone up in recent years. The Center got 26 marijuana-related calls last year, up from seven calls in 2001. Over the 12-year period, 79 percent of the exposures were in the child's house and 23 percent were admitted to a health care facility. There were no deaths.</p>\n",
        "<p>Marijuana producers have pressed for details on how many of those cases came from store-bought pot, and how many came from homemade items such as pot brownies. Authorities don't keep that data, prompting industry representatives to argue that requiring retail edibles to have a distinct look may not reduce marijuana accidents.</p>\n",
        "<p>\"The most basic data of the scope of the problem is not available right now,\" said Ian Barringer, owner of Rm3 Labs, which tests commercial marijuana products before they can be sold.</p>\n",

Only THC is psychoactive, but both CBD and CBG possess potent medicinal activity and modify the effects of THC.  The other primary effects of cannabis are produced by cannabis\u2019s essential oils, <a href=\"http://www.medicinalgenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Taming-THC-Russo.pdf\">a common class of plant chemicals called terpenes</a>.  Terpenes can be absorbed orally through the mucous membranes of the mouth, but do not survive digestion if chewed up and swallowed.  Myrcene, one of these terpenes (also produced by thyme and lemongrass), is thought to interact with THC and produce the sedative indica effect of smoked or vaporized cannabis varieties. Other terpenes such as beta-caryophyllene and pinene may contribute to the stimulating sativa effect of other cannabis varieties when inhaled.  However, when cannabis medicines are swallowed, they do not exhibit these sativa or indica effects.\r\n",

        "</p><p>We still learning how cannabis works, though that understanding is improving rapidly.  In the late Eighties, the body\u2019s endocannabinoid system was discovered, with which cannabis interacts.  The endocannabinoid system is a regulatory mechanism that modulates the release of compounds produced throughout the body.  As  biomolecular chemist Vincenzo Di Marzo has written, the endocannabinoid system\u2019s role balances how we relax, eat, sleep, forget and protect. Providing this balance and modulation of signaling throughout the body, the endocannabinoid system is sensitive to doses of the compounds found in cannabis that mimic the body\u2019s own endocannabinoids.  Endocannabinoids in the brain interact with endocannabinoid protein receptors to regulate and modulate the release of neurotransmitters between neurons. The system reacts to repeated high doses of cannabis by reducing the density of the receptors with which cannabinoids interact, a process called down regulation.  As the size and frequency of cannabis dose increases, the density of endocannabinoid receptor targets decreases.  This tolerance to the effects of cannabis is why the same dose that a heavy cannabis user consumes easily overwhelms a newbie.  Again, it\u2019s all about dose. If you want to avoid down-regulation, control your dose. \r\n",

When cannabis edibles are swallowed, the delta-9-THC undergoes a transformation within the liver into 11-hydroxy-THC, a different drug twice as strong that lasts twice as long as inhaled delta-9-THC.  Oral absorption and liver metabolism of cannabis take much, much longer than when it is smoked.  Maureen Dowd didn\u2019t feel the effects of the edible she ate for almost an hour, so she took more\u2026 a common and unfortunate error.  There is wide variation among individuals in how quickly they will perceive the effects of oral cannabis, with some individuals taking over three hours to note effects.  \r\n",

Like beer vs. whiskey doses, only a fool would pour and consume a pint of whiskey, because most drinkers learn to dose alcohol.

In a study of smoked cannabis at University of California, San Diego, researchers noted a \u201csweet spot\u201d of dose for smoked cannabis in treating pain.  Too small a dose produced little relief, while too high a dose actually increased the pain levels in the study subjects.

The raw THCA gives up a carboxyl group and converts to its neutral THC form. Additionally, the butter extraction method is not perfectly efficient.)

In just twelve days, those enormous doses were no longer getting the participants uncomfortably high, because the density of their cannabinoid receptors was reduced in response to this chronic exposure.

However, patients report that when combined, CBD and THC, at low doses, appear slightly synergistic and produce more psychoactivity together. In a British study, hair samples from regular cannabis users that contained both THC and CBD were associated with far fewer self-reported episodes resembling psychosis than hair samples that contained only THC.  It is thought that CBD may prevent some of the long-term adverse effects of THC use.  Edibles and tinctures containing only CBD are popular with patients suffering from anxiety, some mental illnesses and seizure disorders.  A CBD/THC prescription medicine called Sativex is available in Europe and Canada.  It is currently undergoing the approval process in the US. \r\n",

Far too few individuals have access to lab-tested and properly labeled herbal cannabis, extractions and infusions, which are only available in Washington, Colorado, California, Oregon, New Mexico, Arizona and Canada.

Most unpleasant edible experiences begin with taking an edible of unknown potency, made by someone with a high tolerance to THC, then shared with a person with little tolerance for THC.  Taking an edible of unknown potency is psychoactive Russian roulette.

        "<p>\u201cBecause of the federal status of cannabis right now, those federal agencies that do all of that monitoring are not allowed to do it,\u201d said Don Land. He is a professor of Chemistry at UC Davis, who works with the cannabis industry.</p>\n",
        "<p>There\u2019s no FDA regulations because the federal government says it\u2019s illegal to sell or use the drug. \u201cI \u00a0don\u2019t buy anything that hasn\u2019t been tested. I don\u2019t buy aspirin from someone on a street corner. I go to a pharmacy,\u201d said Land.</p>\n",

        "<p>Even more disturbing, what they found in the buds that people smoke. Mold. And pesticides. 40% of the samples couldn\u2019t be sold in Colorado or Washington where there are limits.

        "<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Statement from Compassion Edibles director Mickey Martin:</span></strong></p>\n",
        "<p>Thank you for taking the time to reach out to Compassion Edibles for a response to your investigative findings regarding medical cannabis foods and the current landscape of cannabis lab testing. As a growing and immature industry we have a lot of work to do to find better methods of providing accurately dosed and tested products to patients in need. Where the current edibles testing situation lacks is in the ability to perform the rigorous testing that is required for food products. These tests are done in in lab settings that are primarily designed to test approximate ratios of plant matter and extracted plant matter. Testing foods requires a far more extensive testing regimen than is able to be provided in current cannabis labs, in our opinion. Most labs that do food testing focus solely on that, and take a lot of time perfecting a process for each type of food product they are testing, whether it be to see if there is the percentage of juice listed on a label or the specified blend of coffee beans in a certain batch. It is unfortunate that in an effort to provide numbers for a dispensary or client in a timely fashion, the testing of edibles becomes very questionable.</p>\n",
        "<p>We work with dozens of dispensary clients throughout the state who share our frustrations. Each has a tale about how their product testing, especially edibles, has been all over the map. As a business operator, it is difficult to have imperfect projections based on a small sampling, done often in rushed conditions, be used as a standard of validity when it is anything but. The industry is just not evolved enough to believe that these independent non-regulated labs that have no oversight or review, and who often share ownership with their clients, can be trusted to provide entirely accurate results. The variation of batch testing from lab to lab, and often even within the same lab on different days, is remarkable. It would almost be humorous if there was not the fact that many medical cannabis provider\u2019s livelihoods were at stake. As supposed gatekeepers, it is difficult to believe that there is so much allowable variation in process and method.</p>\n",
        "<p>We have done blind testing of our raw materials at several cannabis labs at a time, only to have the results vary wildly. Submitting the same batch of butter or oil to different labs and getting results that could vary from 30-40% makes accurate dosing of edibles a challenge for any producer; and that is just the raw materials. When you get into the actual food substances testing the results are incredibly misleading and inconsistent.</p>\n",
        "<p>A lab tests a sample size of a particular product, and not the entire product. Mixing batches of food is challenging enough to ensure a proper ratio of medicine goes into each product. The methods the labs are putting forth by testing only a very small sample of that food product is impossible to quantify.</p>\n",
        "<p>So imagine if you had a cup of butter that you knew had approximately 4,000 mg of THC in it and you wanted to make cookies where the batch called for 40 pieces, meaning each cookie would have approximately 100mg of THC in them if mixed thoroughly. So mixing that cookie batter to ensure that each of the 40 cookies was adequately dosed would require a thorough mixing. Even with that there is no absolute, so our packages contain the phrase \u201capp.\u201d Which is the medical abbreviation for \u201capproximately,\u201d and we tell our clients there can be a 15% variation from product to product.</p>\n",
        "<p>Now imagine that a lab takes one of those cookies (that were already challenging enough to ensure approximately 100mg of THC were in each cookie) and broke off just a small piece for testing. Now they are asking you to not only ensure that each cookie has approximately 100mg of THC, but that each 1/100<sup>th</sup> of a piece of cookie had that exact ratio (app. 1mg).</p>\n",
        "<p>You can see how what is being put forth as accurate testing in that respect is nearly impossible; and that is just a cookie.</p>\n",
        "<p>The same process that is used for cookies is being used for each type of food product, and the same sampling and accurate measurement of the whole product is not reflected in the results. Add to that the evolving methodology of these labs, and the ever changing work load that results in often rushed results to meet a deadline, and you can see how there may be inconsistent and unreliable data being produced.</p>\n",
        "<p>We are in close connection with several labs who do testing for the industry, as well as the dispensaries and providers they serve. We have consistently heard the same complaints throughout. The labs provide a certain aura of responsibility in the political environment, as those who provide cannabis can say \u201cSee. It was tested by the lab.\u201d But most industry insiders put very little faith in the actual results provided because they have all experienced strange and bizarre results from any number of labs. Until there is a standard truly third party lab that has the capability to do the type of testing needed for food products, there will continue to be a great fluctuation of results where cannabis foods are concerned.</p>\n",
        "<p>What we know is that we have provided quality, safe, and affordable cannabis food products to thousands of cannabis patients in the state, and have gotten incredible feedback on the consistency and efficacy of our product lines. Until cannabis lab testing is a more reliable resource, in addition to testing our active ingredients with an array of labs, we also do bioassay testing with patients to ensure the products are consistent. We are pleased with the response we have had from the patients we serve.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">\u00a0Statement from Pete Jr. at Big Pete\u2019s Treats\u00a0 </span></strong></p>\n",
        "<p>We slow cook our butter with trim and buds this allows for a wide spectrum of cannabinoids to be extracted. \u00a0We use no butane or hash oil. We are finding that the medicinal properties out much greater with our \u201cold school\u201d butter recipes. We test our butter for THC content and know exactly how much butter is in each cookie. As the cookies are in the oven they are losing THC. This is why the THC levels can be lower than stated in the packaging.</p>\n",

        "<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Statement from Angela at Medizen:</span></strong></p>\n",
        "<p>As I checked the end of September I remember exactly what happened with the products (that KPIX picked up.)</p>\n",
        "<p>That was the week I attempted to use a new co2 oil vendor.\u00a0 In the past year that MediZen INC has been alive I have changed oil vendors 4 times! Due to inconsistencies mainly. \u00a0The week of those results I attempted to use a new vendor because our latest vendor has higher prices than I want to pay.\u00a0 I gave another guy a shot at being our supplier and he falsely reported his meds.\u00a0 It happens. How can you trust that someone\u2019s lab reports are valid before making a purchase other than testing them yourself right?\u00a0 Unfortunately I let that one slip past me. I took his lab reports and parted ways with the hopeful knowledge of its accuracy.\u00a0 A week later I made a drop at the lab and was furious 24 hours later when I saw the lab report come back so low.\u00a0 Everything left from that batch was removed from inventory and the week later I went back to the expensive vendor I trust, and met at the laboratory we use so at least I know he is credible.</p>\n",
        "<p>Since then the lab has provided us with a formula chart to modify our recipe if our vendor\u2019s product fluctuates.\u00a0 After reopening production everything has improved! It\u2019s just so unfortunate a handful of bad products got in circulation and this is the result.</p>\n",
        "<p>I now know that this has nothing to do with the lab, although that was my first initial uproar when I received the call.\u00a0 The fault was my own for trusting a new vendor. \u00a0It\u2019s very sad to say how shady business has become in this industry! Everyone is just trying to lie cheat and steal to win.\u00a0 September 15 I discovered my ex business partner was still using my name and brand without approval and had forged numerous invoices collecting cash I had no knowledge of.\u00a0 I have recently began to recover from the damage as well as the business but I can honestly say in the midst of all the valleys I\u2019ve been through lately I allowed another snake to cross my path.</p>\n",
        "<p>We are trying to position ourselves ahead of the curve and provide a quality medicine for all our patients.\u00a0 I\u2019ve spent thousands of dollars at labs modifying recipes and just as much money modifying our labels.\u00a0 We want our consumers to know that MediZen INC is way more than just another edible company; we are patients, and believers of its medical effects too.\u00a0 Be patient with us if you have lost faith.\u00a0\u00a0MediZen INC has had numerous changes all with the intent of doing it the right way and being the best at it.\u00a0\u00a0We are still learning and we are still growing despite all the setbacks.\u00a0\u00a0All I can say is if we had a financial backing like some of these companies we would be the one and only gummy candy in every collective.\u00a0\u00a0There are big brands out there now with millions of dollars and they chose to not do things correctly.\u00a0\u00a0I have shut down productions once to fix potency issues and I will do it as many more times as it takes!\u00a0\u00a0This is beyond me and my employees, the consumers deserve best.</p>\n",

        "<p>Bosses have to sign off on strange items on expense reports from time to time \u2014 is that Swedish Massage his salesman got at his hotel really a business expense? \u2014 but KPIX reporter Mike Sugerman might have just turned in the strangest expense report of all time: $600 worth of high-quality medical marijuana. \u201cFor a story.\u201d</p><div class=\"ym\" id=\"ym_667311138333727814\"></div>\n",
        "<p>To be fair, Sugerman really did do a story with the marijuana he bought. The reporter, who works for the <a href=\"http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/11/17/strangest-expense-report-ever-tv-reporter-buys-600-worth-of-medical-marijuana-for-story-kpix-mike-sugerman/\">San Francisco CBS affiliate</a>, was concerned about the fact that the booming medical marijuana industry in California is under-regulated. Since pot is illegal at the national level, the FDA cannot and does not regulate the contents, or the labeling, of pot products. Sugerman, who has a California medical marijuana card (because who in California doesn\u2019t?), was particularly concerned with \u201cedibles\u201d \u2014 that is, the hugely popular food and drink products that contain cannabis and give a high without having to ingest burning smoke.</p>\n",
        "<blockquote><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no regulation because the Feds consider it illegal. The FDA can\u2019t get involved.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n",
        "<p>Edibles have given pot regulators fits in Colorado as well. According to this <a href=\"http://www.inquisitr.com/1552400/colorado-thinks-its-time-to-ban-pot-brownies-and-other-pot-edibles/\"><em>Inquisitr</em></a> report, pot regulators briefly considered banning edibles in Colorado due to concerns about their safety, labeling, and concerns about children being drawn to them. However, they later backed off that plan.</p>\n",
        "<p>For his <a href=\"http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/11/17/medicinal-marijuana-pot-weed-legal-medical-dispensary-sugerman-edibles-thc-potency-test-california-high-drugs-cannabis-dea/\">story</a>, Sugerman bought pot edibles, concentrates, and flowers \u2014 $600 worth, for which he kept meticulous receipts to include on his expense report \u2014 at various random dispensaries at 12 locations in the San Francisco-Oakland area. Then he took them home, sat in front of a camera, put on some Bob Marley tunes, and got ridiculously blazed.</p>\n",
        "<p>Just kidding \u2014 he took them to a lab to be tested by scientists wearing labcoats. You can watch his report by clicking <a href=\"http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/11/17/strangest-expense-report-ever-tv-reporter-buys-600-worth-of-medical-marijuana-for-story-kpix-mike-sugerman/\">here</a>.</p>\n",
        "<p>Sugerman\u2019s bosses at KTVI eagerly encouraged his report, even if it meant some awkward questions from the KPIX Finance Department when he turned in his expense report.</p>\n",
        "<blockquote><p>\u201cThey [the bosses] actually were cool with it. It turned out to be a great story and I think one that will really resonate in the community. We\u2019re flying blind here. And it\u2019s medicine.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n",
        "<p>You may be wondering what happened to the $600 worth of marijuana paid for by KPIX \u2014 it\u2019s highly likely KPIX was wondering what happened to it as well. According to Sugerman, \u201cThe laboratory kept everything.\u201d</p>\n",

        "<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Statement from Compassion Edibles director Mickey Martin:</span></strong></p>\n",
        "<p>Thank you for taking the time to reach out to Compassion Edibles for a response to your investigative findings regarding medical cannabis foods and the current landscape of cannabis lab testing. As a growing and immature industry we have a lot of work to do to find better methods of providing accurately dosed and tested products to patients in need. Where the current edibles testing situation lacks is in the ability to perform the rigorous testing that is required for food products. These tests are done in in lab settings that are primarily designed to test approximate ratios of plant matter and extracted plant matter. Testing foods requires a far more extensive testing regimen than is able to be provided in current cannabis labs, in our opinion. Most labs that do food testing focus solely on that, and take a lot of time perfecting a process for each type of food product they are testing, whether it be to see if there is the percentage of juice listed on a label or the specified blend of coffee beans in a certain batch. It is unfortunate that in an effort to provide numbers for a dispensary or client in a timely fashion, the testing of edibles becomes very questionable.</p>\n",
        "<p>We work with dozens of dispensary clients throughout the state who share our frustrations. Each has a tale about how their product testing, especially edibles, has been all over the map. As a business operator, it is difficult to have imperfect projections based on a small sampling, done often in rushed conditions, be used as a standard of validity when it is anything but. The industry is just not evolved enough to believe that these independent non-regulated labs that have no oversight or review, and who often share ownership with their clients, can be trusted to provide entirely accurate results. The variation of batch testing from lab to lab, and often even within the same lab on different days, is remarkable. It would almost be humorous if there was not the fact that many medical cannabis provider\u2019s livelihoods were at stake. As supposed gatekeepers, it is difficult to believe that there is so much allowable variation in process and method.</p>\n",
        "<p>We have done blind testing of our raw materials at several cannabis labs at a time, only to have the results vary wildly. Submitting the same batch of butter or oil to different labs and getting results that could vary from 30-40% makes accurate dosing of edibles a challenge for any producer; and that is just the raw materials. When you get into the actual food substances testing the results are incredibly misleading and inconsistent.</p>\n",
        "<p>A lab tests a sample size of a particular product, and not the entire product. Mixing batches of food is challenging enough to ensure a proper ratio of medicine goes into each product. The methods the labs are putting forth by testing only a very small sample of that food product is impossible to quantify.</p>\n",
        "<p>So imagine if you had a cup of butter that you knew had approximately 4,000 mg of THC in it and you wanted to make cookies where the batch called for 40 pieces, meaning each cookie would have approximately 100mg of THC in them if mixed thoroughly. So mixing that cookie batter to ensure that each of the 40 cookies was adequately dosed would require a thorough mixing. Even with that there is no absolute, so our packages contain the phrase \u201capp.\u201d Which is the medical abbreviation for \u201capproximately,\u201d and we tell our clients there can be a 15% variation from product to product.</p>\n",
        "<p>Now imagine that a lab takes one of those cookies (that were already challenging enough to ensure approximately 100mg of THC were in each cookie) and broke off just a small piece for testing. Now they are asking you to not only ensure that each cookie has approximately 100mg of THC, but that each 1/100<sup>th</sup> of a piece of cookie had that exact ratio (app. 1mg).</p>\n",
        "<p>You can see how what is being put forth as accurate testing in that respect is nearly impossible; and that is just a cookie.</p>\n",
        "<p>The same process that is used for cookies is being used for each type of food product, and the same sampling and accurate measurement of the whole product is not reflected in the results. Add to that the evolving methodology of these labs, and the ever changing work load that results in often rushed results to meet a deadline, and you can see how there may be inconsistent and unreliable data being produced.</p>\n",
        "<p>We are in close connection with several labs who do testing for the industry, as well as the dispensaries and providers they serve. We have consistently heard the same complaints throughout. The labs provide a certain aura of responsibility in the political environment, as those who provide cannabis can say \u201cSee. It was tested by the lab.\u201d But most industry insiders put very little faith in the actual results provided because they have all experienced strange and bizarre results from any number of labs. Until there is a standard truly third party lab that has the capability to do the type of testing needed for food products, there will continue to be a great fluctuation of results where cannabis foods are concerned.</p>\n",
        "<p>What we know is that we have provided quality, safe, and affordable cannabis food products to thousands of cannabis patients in the state, and have gotten incredible feedback on the consistency and efficacy of our product lines. Until cannabis lab testing is a more reliable resource, in addition to testing our active ingredients with an array of labs, we also do bioassay testing with patients to ensure the products are consistent. We are pleased with the response we have had from the patients we serve.</p>\n",

        "<p>We slow cook our butter with trim and buds this allows for a wide spectrum of cannabinoids to be extracted. \u00a0We use no butane or hash oil. We are finding that the medicinal properties out much greater with our \u201cold school\u201d butter recipes. We test our butter for THC content and know exactly how much butter is in each cookie. As the cookies are in the oven they are losing THC. This is why the THC levels can be lower than stated in the packaging.</p>\n",

        "<p>As I checked the end of September I remember exactly what happened with the products (that KPIX picked up.)</p>\n",
        "<p>That was the week I attempted to use a new co2 oil vendor.\u00a0 In the past year that MediZen INC has been alive I have changed oil vendors 4 times! Due to inconsistencies mainly. \u00a0The week of those results I attempted to use a new vendor because our latest vendor has higher prices than I want to pay.\u00a0 I gave another guy a shot at being our supplier and he falsely reported his meds.\u00a0 It happens. How can you trust that someone\u2019s lab reports are valid before making a purchase other than testing them yourself right?\u00a0 Unfortunately I let that one slip past me. I took his lab reports and parted ways with the hopeful knowledge of its accuracy.\u00a0 A week later I made a drop at the lab and was furious 24 hours later when I saw the lab report come back so low.\u00a0 Everything left from that batch was removed from inventory and the week later I went back to the expensive vendor I trust, and met at the laboratory we use so at least I know he is credible.</p>\n",

        "<p>California Attorney General Kamala Harris says she is \"not opposed\" to legalizing marijuana, but stopped short of endorsing efforts to do so in the Golden State. </p><p>With legal recreational marijuana use fully underway in Colorado and Washington -- and similar programs on the horizon in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C. -- <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/24/marijuana-legalization-california/16180301/\" target=\"_hplink\">advocates</a> are hoping to bring a legalization initiative to the California ballot in 2016. Medical marijuana has been legal in the state since 1996, but recreational use is still prohibited. </p><p>In an interview Monday with <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/adamserwer/californias-attorney-general-thinks-legal-weed-is-inevitable?utm_term=4ldqpia&amp;bftw=pol\" target=\"_hplink\">BuzzFeed</a>, Harris said that while she has no \"moral opposition\" to the substance, she has concerns over the law enforcement implications of legalizing it: </p><blockquote><p>\"I am not opposed to the legalization of marijuana. I'm the top cop, and so I have to look at it from a law enforcement perspective and a public safety perspective,\u201d Harris told BuzzFeed News in an interview in Washington, D.C. \u201cI think we are fortunate to have Colorado and Washington be in front of us on this and figuring out the details of what it looks like when it\u2019s legalized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe're watching it happen right before our eyes in Colorado and Washington. I don't think it\u2019s gonna take too long to figure this out,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI think there's a certain inevitability about it.\"</p></blockquote><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/adamserwer/californias-attorney-general-thinks-legal-weed-is-inevitable?utm_term=4ldqpia&amp;bftw=pol\" target=\"_hplink\">Read the full BuzzFeed interview here.</a></strong></p><p>Earlier this month, Harris was <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/05/kamala-harris-election-results_n_5819890.html\" target=\"_hplink\">elected</a> to a second term, defeating <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/05/kamala-harris-marijuana_n_5652387.html\" target=\"_hplink\">pro-weed</a> Republican Ron Gold. During the campaign, Harris largely evaded the issue, <a href=\"http://www.kcra.com/politics/california-ag-candidate-calls-for-pot-legalization/27308464#!bwB5Ik\" target=\"_hplink\">saying</a> it should be left to voters to decide. (Recent <a href=\"http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/survey/S_314MBS.pdf\" target=\"_hplink\">polls</a> have <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/10/marijuana-legalization-california_n_4421602.html\" target=\"_hplink\">indicated</a> that California voters support legalizing recreational pot.)</p><p>While California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/03/02/gov-jerry-brown-on-legalized-marijuana-how-many-people-can-get-stoned-and-still-have-a-great-state/\" target=\"_hplink\">remains tepid</a> on legal pot, the issue has found a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/11/gavin-newsom-marijuana_n_5662347.html\" target=\"_hplink\">champion</a> in Lt. Gov Gavin Newsom, who has said he would back a legalization ballot measure in 2016. Harris, however, told BuzzFeed she feels it would be \"<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/adamserwer/californias-attorney-general-thinks-legal-weed-is-inevitable?utm_term=4ldqpia&amp;bftw=pol\" target=\"_hplink\">irresponsible</a>\" for her to make a similar endorsement. </p><p>\u201cIt would be easier for me to say, 'Let\u2019s legalize it, let\u2019s move on,' and everybody would be happy. I believe that would be irresponsible of me as the top cop,\" she <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/adamserwer/californias-attorney-general-thinks-legal-weed-is-inevitable?utm_term=4ldqpia&amp;bftw=pol\" target=\"_hplink\">said</a>.  </p><p>Harris, seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party, has already been <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-newsom-harris-20140518-story.html#page=1\" target=\"_hplink\">floated</a> as a potential replacement for California Sen. Barbara Boxer (D), who is <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/Barbara-Boxer-re-election-run-looking-unlikely-5738787.php\" target=\"_hplink\">rumored</a> to be leaning towards retiring after her term ends in 2016. She was also eyed as a potential replacement for outgoing U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, but said she had <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/25/kamala-harris-eric-holder_n_5883584.html\" target=\"_hplink\">no interest</a> in the role.</p><p>\"I am focused on key public safety issues including transnational gangs, truancy and recidivism,\" Harris said in a statement about the speculation. </p>\n",

In four Republican-leaning states -- Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota -- voters considered binding measures to enact hikes, while in Illinois, the referendum was only advisory. \\n\\nVoters in Alaska approved a measure to raise the minimum wage to &#36;9.75 from its current &#36;7.75. In Nebraska, a similar push to hike the hourly wage to &#36;9 from the federal minimum of &#36;7.25 also passed. And in Arkansas and South Dakota, which both currently use the federal minimum wage, voters decided to change the minimum wage to &#36;8.50 an hour. The non-binding referendum in Illinois to raise the minimum wage to &#36;10, from the current statewide &#36;8.25, won as well. \\n\\nFirst and foremost, this is a win for the low-wage workers who will see more take-home pay next year.

        "<p class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">California Attorney General Kamala Harris, a rising star in the Democratic Party, says she\u2019s \u201cnot opposed\u201d to her state legalizing marijuana. </p>\n",
        "<p>The state was one of the first to legalize medical marijuana in 1996, but so far hasn\u2019t legalized it for recreational use, like Colorado, Washington, and others.</p>\n",
        "<p>\u201cI am not opposed to the legalization of marijuana. I\u2019m the top cop, and so I have to look at it from a law enforcement perspective and a public safety perspective,\u201d Harris told BuzzFeed News in an interview in Washington, D.C. \u201cI think we are fortunate to have Colorado and Washington be in front of us on this and figuring out the details of what it looks like when it\u2019s legalized.\u201d</p>\n",
        "<p>\u201cWe\u2019re watching it happen right before our eyes in Colorado and Washington. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna take too long to figure this out,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a certain inevitability about it.\u201d</p>\n",
        "<p>Harris is one of the <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/press/advisory/2014/11/03/100140/save-the-date-center-for-american-progress-to-hold-second-annual-making-progress-policy-conference/\">few state-level officials appearing at an event</a> on Wednesday at the Center for American Progress, an influential left-wing think tank seen as a feeder institution for the Obama administration. Talked up as <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/evanmcsan/kamala-harris-eric-holder\">a contender to replace Eric Holder</a> as attorney general, Harris, who is one of the Democratic Party\u2019s likely prospects for higher office in California, said that even with legalization it\u2019s important that states have systems in place for regulating use of the drug.</p>\n",
        "<p>\u201cIt would be easier for me to say, \u2018Let\u2019s legalize it, let\u2019s move on,\u2019 and everybody would be happy. I believe that would be irresponsible of me as the top cop,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe detail of these things matters. For example, what\u2019s going on right now in Colorado is they\u2019re figuring out you gotta have a very specific system for the edibles. Maureen Dowd <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alisonvingiano/maureen-dowd-on-ad-making-fun-of-the-time-she-got-super-high\">famously did her piece on that</a>\u2026 There are real issues for law enforcement, [such as] how you will measure someone being under the influence in terms of impairment to drive.</p>\n",
        "<p>\u201cWe have seen in the history of this issue for California and other states; if we don\u2019t figure out the details for how it\u2019s going to be legalized the feds are gonna come in, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s in anyone\u2019s best interest,\u201d Harris said. </p>\n",
        "<p>California Gov. Jerry Brown, also a Democrat, has expressed strong misgivings about legalizing marijuana. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/03/02/gov-jerry-brown-on-legalized-marijuana-how-many-people-can-get-stoned-and-still-have-a-great-state/\">On NBC\u2019s <i>Meet the Press</i> in March</a>, Brown asked, \u201cHow many people can get stoned and still have a great state or a great nation?\u201d </p>\n",
        "<p>Harris was far less apprehensive.</p>\n",
        "<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any moral opposition to it or anything like that. Half my family\u2019s from Jamaica,\u201d Harris said with a laugh.</p>\n",

The question is: why hasn\u2019t California?</p>\n",
        "<p>One might think that California would be the first to legalize recreational marijuana, but no. In what some people are calling the \u201cmarijuana midterm\u201d election, Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C. joined Colorado and Washington State in legalizing recreational marijuana \u2014 that\u2019s different from medical marijuana which is legal in California and in a number of states.</p>\n",
        "<p>And where is California? After all, we were leading the way on this issue. In 1975, we reduced the penalty for small amounts of marijuana to a misdemeanor, then in 1996 voters made California the first state to legalize medical marijuana and just a few years ago, our elected officials further reduced the penalty for possession of an ounce or less to a civil infraction with no jail time.</p>\n",
        "<p>But the question of whether to make recreational use legal brings up two\u00a0questions: first, should we legalize it? And second, how\u00a0should we legalize it?</p>\n",
        "<p>On the first question, you may be surprised to learn that only a slim majority of likely voters in California wants to legalize marijuana at all. A recent poll by the <a href=\"http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/survey/S_910MBS.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Public Policy Institute of California</a> shows that only 53 percent of likely voters said we should.</p>\n",
        "<p>And even among people who do want to legalize marijuana, they still need to agree on what it would look like. What does it mean for public safety jobs where employees are drug tested? What it is the legal limit for intoxication? What about the fact that its still illegal under federal law?</p>\n",
        "<p>But now that other states have taken the plunge, it could be less complicated for California.</p>\n",
        "<p>Governor Jerry Brown, who is against legalization, says he\u2019s looking closely at how Colorado is doing to see if we should do something similar. In fact, the same group that played a major role in Colorado\u2019s law, called the Marijuana Policy Project, has formed a committee to put a measure on California\u2019s ballot in 2016.</p>\n",
        "<p>It doesn\u2019t need to be a ballot measure and\u00a0the legislature could at any point pass the same law. But it\u2019s still not a slam dunk. Just two years ago, there was an <a href=\"http://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_19,_the_Marijuana_Legalization_Initiative_(2010)\" target=\"_blank\">attempt to legalize marijuana here in California</a> and it failed.</p>\n",
        "<p>So, don\u2019t look for your elected officials to stick their neck out on this issue where we\u2019re so divided. If it\u2019s going to happen anytime soon, it\u2019s going to come from the voters.</p>\n",

        "<div class=\"fin_story_body\">PROSSER, Wash. (AP) - Washington state's first marijuana auction brought in about $600,000.<br/><br/>Fireweed Farms of Prosser sold about 300 pounds of pot to state-licensed processors and retailers Saturday, <a href=\"http://is.gd/JsJp6T\" target=\"_blank\">the Tri-City Herald reported</a>. <br/><br/>Bidding took place under a black tent fronted by tall heaters, and the event was monitored by at least two representatives of the Washington Liquor Control Board. Bidders could smell plastic bags of buds before offering a bid.<br/><br/>The marijuana was planted in May and harvested between late September and mid-October. Fireweed Farms owner Randy Williams had sold some of his marijuana to recreational processors earlier this year, but the auction represented the bulk of his harvest.<br/><br/>He said he held the auction to \"get rid of it all quick\" so he could spend time with his grandson instead of packaging marijuana. The harvested and dried marijuana was priced by the gram and auctioned by the strain in lots ranging from about half a pound to five pounds.<br/><br/>Williams said he planned to donate proceeds from three lots, totaling $14,000, to local schools.<br/><br/>Lt. Jeremy Wissing, an officer with the state Liquor Control Board who monitored a portion of Saturday's auction, said it appeared to be well run.<br/><br/>\"I'm seeing a well-organized event,\" Wissing said outside the Fireweed Farms grow area. \"It isn't a circus. I'm not seeing open consumption of marijuana.\"<br/><br/>Williams initially hoped to make $1 million through the marijuana fire sale, but said during the auction that he'd be happy with $600,000 or $700,000.<br/><br/>The purchased marijuana was to remain under video-monitored quarantine at Fireweed Farms overnight Saturday, Wissing said. Buyers could either retrieve their marijuana Sunday or arrange for it to be delivered to their business by Williams.<br/><br/>Although Saturday's auction was the state's first, Wissing doesn't expect it to be the last.<br/><br/>\"It's just a different way of moving his product,\" Wissing said.<br/><br/>Interest in the marijuana auction was so intense that Williams commissioned the use of a parking lot across the street from his property to accommodate the visitors.<br/><br/>Buyers were provided with a detailed list of strains and lot sizes that provided a complete potency profile, labeling requirements and the date the batch was tested by Confidence Analytics, a state-certified laboratory. The auction attracted about three dozen potential buyers from across the state.<br/><br/>Nazareth Victoria, a 50-year-old licensed marijuana processor from Seattle, left empty-handed. He came because he was interested in seeing what was available, but ultimately wasn't sure about the quality, he said.<br/><br/>\"I was just interested in the whole process,\" Victoria said. \"To me, smoking the product is the ultimate test to tell you the quality.\"<br/><br/>Sampling the product was strictly forbidden Saturday.<br/><br/>\"This is a controlled business environment,\" Wissing said.</div>\n",

As long as the government don't drive the taxes up legal alcohol sales will continue to grow. They tax it too much it works like prohibition and everyone starts going to the black market for some shine. Get toe up from the flo up. Moonshine tastes so much better than anything on the legal market. The government better be careful about alcohol regulations.</p></p>\n",

        "<div class=\"fin_story_body\">PROSSER, Wash. (AP) - Washington state's first marijuana auction brought in about $600,000.<br/><br/>Fireweed Farms of Prosser sold about 300 pounds of pot to state-licensed processors and retailers Saturday, <a href=\"http://is.gd/JsJp6T\" target=\"_blank\">the Tri-City Herald reported</a>. <br/><br/>Bidding took place under a black tent fronted by tall heaters, and the event was monitored by at least two representatives of the Washington Liquor Control Board. Bidders could smell plastic bags of buds before offering a bid.<br/><br/>The marijuana was planted in May and harvested between late September and mid-October. Fireweed Farms owner Randy Williams had sold some of his marijuana to recreational processors earlier this year, but the auction represented the bulk of his harvest.<br/><br/>He said he held the auction to \"get rid of it all quick\" so he could spend time with his grandson instead of packaging marijuana. The harvested and dried marijuana was priced by the gram and auctioned by the strain in lots ranging from about half a pound to five pounds.<br/><br/>Williams said he planned to donate proceeds from three lots, totaling $14,000, to local schools.<br/><br/>Lt. Jeremy Wissing, an officer with the state Liquor Control Board who monitored a portion of Saturday's auction, said it appeared to be well run.<br/><br/>\"I'm seeing a well-organized event,\" Wissing said outside the Fireweed Farms grow area. \"It isn't a circus. I'm not seeing open consumption of marijuana.\"<br/><br/>Williams initially hoped to make $1 million through the marijuana fire sale, but said during the auction that he'd be happy with $600,000 or $700,000.<br/><br/>The purchased marijuana was to remain under video-monitored quarantine at Fireweed Farms overnight Saturday, Wissing said. Buyers could either retrieve their marijuana Sunday or arrange for it to be delivered to their business by Williams.<br/><br/>Although Saturday's auction was the state's first, Wissing doesn't expect it to be the last.<br/><br/>\"It's just a different way of moving his product,\" Wissing said.<br/><br/>Interest in the marijuana auction was so intense that Williams commissioned the use of a parking lot across the street from his property to accommodate the visitors.<br/><br/>Buyers were provided with a detailed list of strains and lot sizes that provided a complete potency profile, labeling requirements and the date the batch was tested by Confidence Analytics, a state-certified laboratory. The auction attracted about three dozen potential buyers from across the state.<br/><br/>Nazareth Victoria, a 50-year-old licensed marijuana processor from Seattle, left empty-handed. He came because he was interested in seeing what was available, but ultimately wasn't sure about the quality, he said.<br/><br/>\"I was just interested in the whole process,\" Victoria said. \"To me, smoking the product is the ultimate test to tell you the quality.\"<br/><br/>Sampling the product was strictly forbidden Saturday.<br/><br/>\"This is a controlled business environment,\" Wissing said.</div>\n",

Mostly just mexican hay weed. The good stuff like Columbian Gold, Maui Wowey were a lot harder to come by. And none of it is the quality of what we have today.

As long as the government don't drive the taxes up legal alcohol sales will continue to grow. They tax it too much it works like prohibition and everyone starts going to the black market for some shine. Get toe up from the flo up. Moonshine tastes so much better than anything on the legal market. The government better be careful about alcohol regulations.</p></p>\n",

Maier noted that Iowa law now classifies marijuana as both a Schedule I drug, whose use is forbidden for almost any purpose, and a Schedule II drug, which could be used under strict regulation and a doctor's prescription.</p><p>The board recommended in 2009 that legislators reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug, which would be a step toward legalizing its use for some medical purposes. That proposal failed to gain traction.</p><p>Retired Des Moines physician Edward Hertko, a longtime proponent of legalizing marijuana, said opponents have falsely painted it as addictive and as a gateway to harder drugs. \"Its hazards pale when compared with alcohol and tobacco,\" he told the pharmacy board. In fact, he said, marijuana is less deadly than sugar, which causes thousands of deaths each year from obesity and diabetes.</p><p>Iowa legislators last year passed a limited bill that would decriminalize possession of a marijuana extract for people with severe epilepsy. However, families who lobbied for the new law say it's unworkable, because it doesn't allow for the production or sale of the drug in Iowa, and most other states don't allow sales to non-residents.</p><p>University of Iowa pharmacy professor Ron Herman said scientific studies that compare marijuana's effects to those of placebos have found relatively small effects on such things as pain. Herman also warned that unlike patients using pharmaceuticals, people using most marijuana products don't know how strong each dose is.</p><div class=\"story-asset oembed-asset\" id=\"module-position-NqyXMITLj1M\"><div class=\"oembed oembed-desmoinesregister oembed-type-link\" data-oembed-provider=\"desmoinesregister\" data-oembed-type=\"link\"><style>\n",

The current versions are increasingly potent, he said. \"It's not the marijuana of 20 or 30 years ago.\"</p><p>But cancer patient Lori Tassin of Des Moines said she believes the drug can shrink tumors and provide other benefits. \"It should be my choice,\" she told the board. \"It should be between my doctor and me.\"</p><p>The full pharmacy board is to discuss the issue Wednesday. Maier, who is a Mapleton pharmacist, warned that the board does not have authority to legalize medical marijuana on its own.

        "<p>DES MOINES | The state pharmacy board will decide this week whether to once again recommend to the Iowa Legislature that marijuana be reclassified so it may be used for medical purposes.</p><p>Medical marijuana advocates in Iowa want the drug\u2019s classification changed from a Class I to a less dangerous Class II drug. Both classifications, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, suggest the drug has a high potential for abuse. The difference: Class II drugs have accepted medical uses.</p><p>That is why medical marijuana advocates seek the change.</p><p>\u201cEventually, we\u2019re going to run out of options, and I want (medical marijuana) to be an option for me,\u201d said Lori Tassin of Des Moines, who said she has been diagnosed with lung cancer and brain tumors.</p><p>Tassin was among the 13 speakers who addressed a subcommittee of the Iowa Pharmacy Board on Monday. The full board will decide Wednesday whether to restate its suggestion to the Legislature next year.</p><p>The Pharmacy Board in 2010 unanimously agreed to recommend to the Iowa Legislature that it change marijuana from a Class I to Class II drug. The Legislature did not act on the suggestion.</p><p>A petition filed earlier this year requested the Pharmacy Board officially restate its recommendation to the Legislature, which in 2014 passed a law allowing use of cannabidiol, an oil found in the marijuana plant for prescribed medical treatment of children with epilepsy.</p><p>But parents whose children could benefit from the law say it is too narrowly drawn and makes it difficult for them to obtain the cannabidiol, which is not produced in Iowa and is illegal to possess in other states.</p><p>\u201cI urge that the Iowa Board of Pharmacy recommend to the Iowa Legislature and the governor to remove medical marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II, allowing this plant to be recommended by physicians and studied by the medical communities,\u201d said Sally Gaer of West Des Moines, whose 24-year-old daughter has epilepsy.</p><p>Two representatives of Gov. Terry Branstad\u2019s administration spoke Monday in opposition to changing marijuana\u2019s classification: Dale Woolery, with the governor\u2019s Office of Drug Control Policy, and Peter Komendowski, with that office\u2019s Partnership for a Drug Free Iowa.</p><p>\u201cThe public discussion that continues in our nation today over marijuana, indeed, is unsettled to say the least. Mixed in with those sincerely talking about potential medical benefits are others who seemingly are more motivated by money, personal choice, addictions or other reasons,\u201d Woolery said. \u201cThe Office of Drug Control Policy is concerned with the health and safety of all Iowans. As such, our office supports the development of safe, tested and effective, research-driven, cannabis-based medicines for use by health care professionals to treat patients with valid medical needs without compromising the health and public safety of Iowans.\u201d</p><p>Reclassification would not legalize marijuana for recreational use.</p>\n",

Maier noted that Iowa law now classifies marijuana as both a Schedule I drug, whose use is forbidden for almost any purpose, and a Schedule II drug, which could be used under strict regulation and a doctor's prescription.</p><p>The board recommended in 2009 that legislators reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug, which would be a step toward legalizing its use for some medical purposes. That proposal failed to gain traction.</p><p>Retired Des Moines physician Edward Hertko, a longtime proponent of legalizing marijuana, said opponents have falsely painted it as addictive and as a gateway to harder drugs. \"Its hazards pale when compared with alcohol and tobacco,\" he told the pharmacy board. In fact, he said, marijuana is less deadly than sugar, which causes thousands of deaths each year from obesity and diabetes.</p><p>Iowa legislators last year passed a limited bill that would decriminalize possession of a marijuana extract for people with severe epilepsy. However, families who lobbied for the new law say it's unworkable, because it doesn't allow for the production or sale of the drug in Iowa, and most other states don't allow sales to non-residents.</p><p>University of Iowa pharmacy professor Ron Herman said scientific studies that compare marijuana's effects to those of placebos have found relatively small effects on such things as pain. Herman also warned that unlike patients using pharmaceuticals, people using most marijuana products don't know how strong each dose is.</p><div class=\"story-asset oembed-asset\" id=\"module-position-NqyXMITLj1M\"><div class=\"oembed oembed-desmoinesregister oembed-type-link\" data-oembed-provider=\"desmoinesregister\" data-oembed-type=\"link\"><style>\n",

The current versions are increasingly potent, he said. \"It's not the marijuana of 20 or 30 years ago.\"</p><p>But cancer patient Lori Tassin of Des Moines said she believes the drug can shrink tumors and provide other benefits. \"It should be my choice,\" she told the board. \"It should be between my doctor and me.\"</p><p>The full pharmacy board is to discuss the issue Wednesday. Maier, who is a Mapleton pharmacist, warned that the board does not have authority to legalize medical marijuana on its own.
